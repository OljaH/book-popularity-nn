But, this book is more than just a thriller, just like King is more than just a pulp writer.I read an article by the ever optimistic and cheerful Harold Bloom in college about how dismayed he was that young people like Stephen King so much.
I'd like to see Harold Bloom show enough imagination to write fiction instead of just criticizing it all the time.I'm actually new to Stephen King's fiction.
I appreciate his self awareness as a writer and the fact that he ackowledges how difficult the whole process is while not making us feel like he's somehow superior because he's figured out how to do it.In 'Misery' it's almost like we get to watch King write this story.
Uncle Stevie hadn’t yet frustrated readers of his Dark Tower series with long delays between books, and yet he absolutely nailed the self-righteous fury of a fan who feels somehow cheated out of what they deserve.
Like Paul, King would also have the experience of returning to writing being a matter of overcoming physical pain but also finding it to be a way to escape it.One of King’s biggest strengths is that he knows the power of a good story, and this plot serves him well by really letting him dig into that.
Damn, I can never get over that one scene!!! She's bat sh•t crazy! Happy Reading! 🎃👻Mel 🖤🐺🐾
To celebrate completing a novel, writer Paul Sheldon goes on a champagne-fueled drive in the Rocky mountains.
He's rescued by Annie Wilkes, his #1 fan...I watched the film version of Misery in those antediluvian days before Goodreads, hell, before the Internet, and decided to finally read the novel when it showed up on my BookGorilla email one day.
Annie Wilkes is obsessed with her favorite series of books starring Misery Chastain, written by that dirty birdie Paul Sheldon.
Paul is obsessed with finishing the book Annie has demanded of him and probably addicted to writing.

I don’t ever just like things- I’m either completely enamored with it or not all that interested.
Surely a serious reader can’t be a King fan.
According to a lot of people I know it works the same way when flipped around- a King fan cannot be a serious reader.
I am a King fan  and and a serious reader.
1.) I would never harm Stephen King in any way, shape or form.
Don’t get me wrong, I have a beautiful home, but his house is way fucking cooler.
8.) I want to be friends with Stephen King- not make him fear for his life.
And, because I'm a classic overachiever, I broke my arm in the “most painful way possible,” and I have been relegated to bone broth, limited mobility (to prevent the need for surgery) and left handed, one finger typing (damn it!).As my convalescence began (10 long days ago), I found myself not only in pain and discomfort, but surprisingly more and more weepy as well.
She's his “number one fan,” and no outside help will be needed for Paul's poor legs, which are pointing every which way but loose.
This woman is not right."Paul Sheldon, the best-selling writer of the Misery novels, finds himself rescued from a car accident by his number one fan, Annie Wilkes.
As the former nurse takes care of him in her home, she finds out he killed off Misery in his latest novel and decides to keep Paul as her prisoner as he writes Misery back to life.I read a number of Stephen King books pre-bookstagram and pre-goodreads, therefore I have never written a proper review for these books.
This is much better portrayed in the movie for me.Something else that the movie benefits from is cutting out the parts where Paul is writing his new Misery book.
It took me longer than usual to get into this King book, which was largely down to the writing style.
I felt it was different than his usual style (which is the one I adore so much).
I wish I had the right qualifications to analyze this book and its characters on a psychological level, because I bet it would incredibly interesting.So even though it took me a while to be enthralled by the book, it is still definitely worth a read!I'd also like to mention how much I appreciated the little snippets of the actual "Misery"-novels that were included in the story.
i can tell this my favourite book of Stephen king so far
-------------After the two month hiatus from Stephen King, I promised myself that I'm not going to let the fact that he's my favorite author, affect my rating of whatever book of his I'm reading next.
I've had a few encounters with spoilers, and honestly that's the real reason why I haven't read Stephen King's "It" yet.
To keep it short, it's all about Paul Sheldon, the writer, being held captive of the crazy psycho Annie.
She's just normally cock-a-doodie in the head.Just like most of the King novels I've read, the main epitome of greatness lies on the characters.
"Your life will never be the same," he said.He was right.Misery is about the kind of fan that loves their chosen celebrity a little too much.
In this case, Paul Sheldon was rescued from a car crash by his number one fan, Annie.
She loves his books, so when she finds out Paul killed her favorite character in the latest installment, she gets a little...
And you do not want to make Annie upset.You scared yet?King's writing has a way of putting you directly in a character's shoes.
And be King's number one fan.
Me ha encantado y a la vez me ha hecho sufrir de miedo, angustia y tensión desde el primer capítulo hasta el último.Tuve pesadillas dos noches seguidas...Estoy convencida de que los libros que generan tantos sentimientos en el lector merecen muchas estrellas.!!Me gustó mucho el guiño que hace el autor a “El resplandor”.
Stephen describe tan bien a los dos personajes de esta novela, que por momentos me olvidaba que estaba leyendo y me sentía igual de atrapada que Paul en la habitación de huéspedes.
Espero que si no lo han leído se animen y que lo disfruten tanto como yo .!
Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge #13: A Book that is Also a Stage Play or a MusicalThis was super great! It was suspenseful, and the characters were very vivid. The whole thing was bogged down a tiny bit by the book-within-a-book bits (I'm not as big of a fan of Paul's writing as Annie is lol) and it was less gory than I was expecting, but other than that it was fantastic! Definitely one of my favorite Stephen King books that I've read so far (It is still my favorite at the moment.)
King has penned some page-turning mothers over the years, but the story of Paul Sheldon and his number one fan Annie Wilkes has got to be the most page-turning of them all.
I guess you could classify this book as psychological suspense, since there are absolutely no supernatural elements introduced here, but for me Misery will remain classic horror because I really do feel like King's ultimate goal in writing it is to scare the shit out of us.
In Misery, King is able to inject a lot of what he knows and believes about the craft and all the tics and challenges that come along with it.
It took me AGES (4 1/2 fucking months smh) to read this and I have absolutely no idea why.
I enjoyed it a lot.
I thought I would like it even more than I did though.I had a few problems with King's writing style in this particular book (especially in the beginning) even though I'm normally a really big fan of it.
And I was bored to death every time there were actual parts of "Misery" (the book that's being written by the author in this) to read.
Annie was such a well written, interesting and absolutely terrifying character!
She helped a lot with building the right atmosphere.I'm so excited for watching the movie!
Imagine having a nasty car accident and being rescued by your number one FAAAN!A fan who happens to be a complete lunatic.
This book is gripping.
An accomplished author killing off his main character because he is stuck in a rut.
Held prisoner by his number one fan.
Coerced into writing his novel and not to dare finish the character off.
What a book.
Also a film starring Kathy Bates and James Caan.
Good film but not as good as the book.
I did not give it five stars because King has written better ones but, most of his work is 4+ stars🐯👍
The reason authors almost always put a dedication on a book, Annie, is because their selfishness even horrifies themselves in the end.Goodbye sleep and hello Annie!I'm certain that my favorite book by King will always be Pet Sematary, but this book came pretty close to changing my mind.
probably)Now about the book...Meet Annie Wilkes, a nice old woman who likes to read (just like all of us), but who also has a hobby of capturing and torturing her favorite author (unlike all of us...
And, unlike Annie, he became my favorite King's character.
Even though Annie made this book interesting, I loved hearing from Paul's POV.
Ouvir a história pelo ponto de vista do Paul, sem saber do que sua fã número é capaz, e ver aos poucos ela ir passando dos limites foi uma experiência inesquecível.
Toda a questão sobre fã x ídolo que o Stephen King levanta nessa história, nos faz pensar muito sobre como as pessoas reagem hoje em dia quando seu livro preferido não termina do jeito que elas esperavam.
Depois dessa leitura, Stephen King segue sendo um dos autores que mais me instigam e o meu interesse por seus livros só aumenta!
Same thing for Kathy Bates/Annie Wilkes.
I literally wanted to scream, “NO Annie please!” along with Paul.
I will not be able to look at this book in the future without feeling a visceral response traveling directly to my legs.------------------------------------------------------------------------------1/7/17You're the dirty bird Annie Wilkes, and this is for you: "I want to look her straight in the eye and tell her what a cheap, lying, no good, rotten, far flushing, snake licking, dirt eating, inbreed, overstuffed, ignorant, blood sucking, dog kissing, brainless, dickless, hopeless, heartless, fat assed, bug eyed, stiff legged, spotty lipped, worm headed, sack of monkey shit she is!!!
a list of things this book was:- disgusting- disturbing- a quick read, surprisingly- really fond of using sexual assault as a metaphor (cool cool cool)- harmfully stereotypical in terms of race (the Africa references/setting)- harmfully stereotypical in terms of gender (so much man-goes-to-work woman-stays-home)- honestly just pretty hateful toward women??- all for using the n word without blinking, apparentlya list of things this book was not:- scary- all that great of a read for mebottom line: i guess i get the stephen king appeal.
time to show me what all the fuss is about.(in other words: this is my first stephen king book and i'm ready to scream in fear)
A super intense thriller where I could just envision Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes inflicting her horrors on Paul Sheldon; but as scary as the movie was, the book is much more terrifying! Poor Paul endures more than one (view spoiler)[pre-op procedure that was not included in the movie (hide spoiler)] that completely surprised me. One of the scariest and best Stephen King novels I've read thus far!
Sabía que cuando leyera Misery iba a gustarme tanto que iba a empatar con It en el primero puesto de libros favoritos de Stephen King.
Despertará en casa de Annie Wilkes, una mujer que lo ha recogido y está curando sus heridas.
Annie resultará ser la fan número uno de las historias de Misery.Y bueno, hasta aquí puedo contar.
La historia es archiconocida y el que conozca a King, sabrá por donde podrá ir.
Me gustó mucho sobre todo el deterioro mental que sufre Paul durante la novela, mucha más apremiante que el físico, lo cual es sorprendente, teniendo en cuenta a la buena de Annie xD.
This is King at his best. He takes a totally innocuous subject - an ardent fan, a typewriter, a bedroom door, anything at all - and infuses it with horrifying elements ordinarily reserved for more supernatural spectres. The reader is then thrust down a rabbit hole full of ill-ease, second-guessing, and the knowledge they will never be able to trust anything again when they return to the real-world, at the novel's close, breathless and with an entirely new outlook on life.
You know those times in which you love a book, love it so so much you also start loving the author, and then you promise yourself you’re going to read more of his/her works until you finally declare yourself to be one of their fans?
I do, and I bet Annie Wilkes did too.There’s a series of books I love with all my heart and soul – you already know which it is.
Well, the thing is, not long ago I reread it, and I went… a little crazy over the head.
I got damn obsessed about it (I still am) and I c
Everyone in my family knew something was wrong with me, and they thought I was insane, but boy, nothing will ever compare to how Annie Wilkes is with her favourite author.You see, she’s Paul Sheldon’s Number One Fan: She has read and loved everything he has ever written.
Like when she told Paul how he had to write his books, how she thought he was not doing it the right way, how the book was going to be better, how she couldn’t accept some of Paul’s ideas, how she fancied hers were the only correct ones… everything leads to a troll!
Crazy good. Thriller with psychotic sprinkles.
My first SK novel.
I wasn't overly scared..
wanting to finish quickly as my main motivation was to see the movie.
I was mostly picturing the talented Kathy Bates, after googling many of the images from the film.
Another synopsis isn't needed, such a classic book it is, but I was not fussed.
I own many other of his novels to read and may get to them at some stage.I read in many reviews this was one of his scariest book, but I was not convinced of this.
I wonder what the movie will hold for me.
Misery was the second Stephen King book I ever read.
I came across Misery much the same way I did Dolores Claiborne - through my mother's subscription to the Stephen King Book Club.
The violence is rather extreme, but we all know that bad words and intercourse are much worse than chopping people up, right?
Anyway, back in the days before the interwebs, the Stephen King Book Club worked like this.
By the time Dolores Claiborne came out, Mom was all the way up to Misery.
Where was I...)Misery is one of my favorite King novels because it deals with writing and the writing process.
I liked Paul's comments about the publishing business and the craft of being a writer — some of it felt like an early version of King' excellent memoir On Writing.I've only read a fraction of King's total catalog, but he has such a distinct style — mixing comedy and horror and smartassery — that several times while reading Misery I thought, "Only King could have written that." The other remarkable thing about this book is the nice trick King pulls with his story-within-a-story, creating sections of a romance novel Paul was forced to write for Annie.
Man, it's been years since I read this book, and I forgot how much there was to it that was NOT the hobbling bit.
Had Paul Sheldon not decided to drive drunk (blizzard or no), she probably would have gone on quite some time on her semi-secluded little farm, with just her animals.
In the same vein, I asked one of my bookclub friends who is a medical professional how likely it is that Paul would have gotten as addicted to the codeine-based Novril as he did, and he said, "Without a doubt, she hooked him on purpose, right from the start." Which makes perfect sense, when spelled out that way, of course.
