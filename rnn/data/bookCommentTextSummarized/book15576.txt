Dearest Rake, Omg! My husband has arrived!  The Tiste Andii had gathered into a silent ring around the central clearing, awaiting the arrival of their master. The black, silver-maned dragon emerged from the darkness overhead like a piece of night torn loose, flowing down to settle with a soft crunch of talons in the plain's stony soil. The huge, terrible beast blurred even as it landed, with a warm flow of spice-laden air swirling out to all sides as the sembling drew the dragon's shape inward.
What might Kallor fear most, if not an alliance between the Son of Darkness and Silverfox?
Although, I do know there is a book coming up that I am dreading.
I fall more in love with these characters every time I read about them.
We are finally back to where we started in the first book with the characters I know.
I really loved the character of Silverfox.
And we all know I loved Rake being back in the book.
Jesus, I know that he's going to make all of the books have sad endings and we are going to lose so many more of the people that we love.
A peerless and jaw-dropping epic installment; I consider myself damn lucky to have witnessed this powerfully evocative tale.I’ve stated that it’s mandatory to read at least two books of the series in order to truly find out whether you’ll love this series or not.
Erikson carves a bloody path to your heart with his superb characterizations and palpable tensions building.Picture: K'Chain Che'Malle versus T’lan Imass by J.K. DrummondI’ve read only his first three books but I must say, this is Erikson’s prose at its best so far.
*** 4.85 ***Second time around even better than the first!!! What was I thinking! This deserves to be rounded up to 5 stars!!! But the pain.... Just as painful and potent as the first time! __________________________________*** 4.35 ***A buddy read with my family and friends at BB&B!

No wonder some of my fellow readers feel like they need to get a college credit after finishing every book n the series:):):) Well, despite the scope of the novel, Erikson has found a way to keep us involved in the lives of all sides of a conflicted alliance between very reluctant frenemies.
However, as far as old favorites go, this was the book where the true character of Whiskeyjack shone in all of its glory with its humanity, nobility and strength, while Kruppe was the light of the bunch and where SE shows his chops as a writer, in my humble opinion.
This contrast makes the merciless account of human tragedy all the more heart-wrenching and the moments of hope and humour all the more uplifting.The plot of this book could easily be seen as traditional fantasy.
I really liked this contrast and her sections really helped to ground the story and keep things in perspective.The massive cast of characters in this one was a great mix of new faces and old favourites from GoTM.
Along with his fellow Grey Swords he provided some of this book’s most interesting world building (especially about the complex relationship between gods and their followers) and most sweeping tragedy (view spoiler)[ the last stand of the Mortal sword and Itkovian’s sacrifice at the end...
When you dig deep beyond the main plot you realize that this is something more than just a war story, this is a convergence of actions from thousands of years ago and memories and consequences of those actions are shaping the world today.There is one character who reminded me the most of that quote and that is the leader of the Pannion Domin but again, I can't explain more without spoiling the book for you but I hope that those of you who have read it will get what I was trying to say.
The harder the world, the fiercer the honour. This in-world quote succinctly explains why this book still ranks as the favourite volume of my favourite grimdark epic fantasy series. It is the reason why I even read grimdark in the first place, given that I am so easily assailed by emotions that one wonders why I willingly put myself through such heartbreak. So bear with me throughout this series when I keep waxing lyrical about how humanity manifests its most awe-inspiring qualities in the face
So bear with me throughout this series when I keep waxing lyrical about how humanity manifests its most awe-inspiring qualities in the face of relentless hardship and horrors of a world ravaged by conflict.
To be exact, part I of the Prologue was dated almost three hundred thousand years before humans walked on this world.
Just as readers of the Malazan Book of the Fallen need to fashion armour for their hearts.
(hide spoiler)]As usual I became a bit teary while reading as Erikson fans really know that there won’t be any restrain in harvesting some faves, at the same time I was in awe how the author managed to weave the tale, making the characters so alive, lovable and forcing me to shudder at every attempt when I lost some.
Also, while reading MoI, I got essential information regarding the past of some characters from earlier books and the flow of story left me speechless of how everything is entwined into several other significant plot-lines, while joining characters, history of the place, warrens into one exciting action-packed tale.It was great to follow the several different characters in their journey.
I don’t know if I’m becoming a more acquainted with Steven Erickson’s writing and thus I understood more of this book OR this book was just more readable than the first 2.Finally stuff is making more and more sense to me. But there is so much that happens in this book that it is really hard to sum it up in a review. However this is what I’ve now learned from Steven Erickson in this series: - My favorite Character will die. Seriously 3 books and in each one the character I liked the most ended up
❻ - The one relationship that you root for in the book will be torn apart or never really get any tractionThere are many other things I’ve learned but those are the main bits.Dujek, Whiskeyjack and the Bridgeburners were always one of my favorites from Gardens of the Moon and so I was happy to be with them again.
I wasn’t really sure what to think of him at the beginning but his story actually ended up being my favorite for this book.
Beware of walking on thin ice.Chapter 21: Itkovian is not yet done.
Chapter 10: When I read “we must make the impossible possible” I know that the chain of dogs trauma is about to repeat and that I should invest in a coffin for my poor heart grieving for Itkovian.Chapter 9: Toc, stop flirting with Envy, she will just Rake you over old coals.
Chapter 5: Kruppe friend, from now on I intend to take you to all the high management meetings.
All I can give you is a chapter breakdown of my own meltdown.The Malazan Book of the Fallen:1.
The Crippled God RTC
“The harder the world, the fiercer the honour.”  The Bridgeburners - Sorry, Hedge, Detoran, Fiddler, Quick Ben, WhiskeyJack, Mallet, Antsy, KalamThis will be more of a my feelies about stuff and fangirly essay than a review. There's your warning!Memories of Ice was literally the longest read of my life. I've never taken more than 2 weeks to finish a book, be it good or dull as watching two turtles go at it. But, due to the curse upon my malazan reading experience, I know this is Erikson's doing
Learning how he came to be a bridgeburner, not even counting the amazing setting the tale was told in, was heartwarming.Quick's warrenThis is the best fitting drawing of him, because of the revelations we get about warrens *finally!* and his impressive show off with his warrens.
(view spoiler)[after the emotional scene with Toc, his meeting with Hetan was a sweet side of Erikson we don't see that often.
(hide spoiler)]Whiskeyjack was another character we finally get to know closer.
(hide spoiler)]Another thing I love and hate simultaneously about Erikson, is that I haven't felt the need to use dictionary this frequently while reading, ever since reading my first book in english.
My favourite part of this book, and rising to become one of my favourite Malazan characters, is Lady Envy, the powerful daughter of the mythic god Draconus.
Just like when I read the Black Company books, I find that the series as a whole is worthy of five stars, but that the individual books are not.It also suffers a bit from the ending to Deadhouse Gates being virtually impossible to top in my eyes.
That is not only my favourite part of the Malazan series so far, but one of the best endings to a fantasy book I have ever read.
Erikson's decision to flip back and forth between books wasn't apparent to me at first, but I was happy to be back with some familiar characters from GotM.
Most of the characters in Memories of Ice I was already familiar with from GotM, but there were new faces thrown into the mix for this book as well.
The friendships that were formed and how those relationships effected events, was one of the best elements of this book to me.
Still great, but Memories of Ice is in a league of its own.
A true masterpiece of the genre. If  Gardens of the Moon  (however ambitious) was a sloppy introduction with narrative obstructions that prevented shiny and glossy entry into the series, then duo of  Deadhouse Gates  with its emotional wrestling and  Memories of Ice  with its flawless execution, were determined in their goal to win you over for eternity.In my opinion, this is Erikson’s best book. And the words I would use to describe it are: perfectly balanced.Sufficiently developed newly intro
And the words I would use to describe it are: perfectly balanced.Sufficiently developed newly introduced characters, engulfed with spry sense of humor - something that will from now on stand as Erikson’s strongest trademark and the main reason why are we falling in love with these characters in the first place (beside their bottomless depth, of course); deep and compelling story, that, while a continuation of the first book, also successfully juggles the parallel story of the second one - all while further progresses in building the world, without actually overwhelming the reader.On the contrary.
Diversity is worth celebrating, Humbrall Taur, for it is the birthplace of wisdom. One of my friends on GR who has read this books said, Memories of Ice (MoI) makes Deadhouse Gates(DG) looks like Gardens of the moon(GoTM) and I could not agree more. The predeccessors of this book were great but this surpassed all my expectations. The plot is Aamazing, lots of revelations, answers to questions from the first two books, we finally get to know about the origin of Dragnipur, the elder gods, what ma
If you are familiar with this series you need not be told that this series has an unusual number of characters, this is book 3 and I still don’t know who the main characters are, I’ve counted more than 10 main characters so far, here are my favourites in this book.The new characters are Gruntle, Stonny Menackis, Itkovian,Lady Envy, Pannion, Hetan, Cafel, Anaster and a host of othersGruntle and Stonny are my favs among the new characters, they have known each other all their lives, they work together as Caravan guards with a friend of theirs Harllo, Gruntle is careful and cynical while Stonny is the exact opposite, and its the two of them that’s on the cover of one of the editions.
This is one of the most EPIC book I have ever read.
Scratch that, it is the most EPIC book I have ever read.
This is why the word, EPIC was created and invented, to describe and sum up this book in one word.
Steven Erikson is the most EPIC writer I have ever read, and this is his BEST book of all time.
He is CLEARLY LAPS AHEAD of George R.R. Martin in WRITING STYLE, PACE, and ESPECIALLY EPICNESS.
George R.R. Martin can learn a thing or two from Erikson.
ERIKSON IS PURE EPICNESS in a bottle.
I struggled with a large part of Gardens of the Moon as Erikson throws readers in to the massive world he has created, and it is sink or swim.
However with Memories of Ice I felt like I had a pretty good handle on the world he created, allowing me to enjoy the little things.Like his amazing writing, with unique characters and great dialogue.
I do appreciate an author that can so subtly veil jokes that if you read too quickly you may miss a hidden gem.Which pretty much sums up this entire book.
There are many different plot lines and characters, that somehow all intertwine neatly producing a hell of a story.
Reread: I think after the first read I was so shell shocked I really didn't know what to write.
Even on reread this book just takes it out of you.
The amount of empathy written into the characters and the scenes.
The first time around if forced to choose I would have said DHG was a nano increment better than MOI.
I have to go the other way upon reread.
I think the advantage DHG has is it's the first time SE shatters your heart.
This time around different scenes affected me as much if not more than the first time around.
Again, the density of world building combined with the layers of mystery and foreshadowing are just mind boggling and difficult to appreciate the first time round, but are a wonder to unpack on subsequent reads.This third book of the series takes us back to the continent on Genabackis where we are reunited with the Bridgeburners as we pick up the story from book one.
They fight for the man on their right and on their left and the gods can go to Hood.
What a personality!And of course there's a lot to love about Brood and Rake, both in story, history, and personal quirks, but Silverfox really does rather steal the show for me.What I'm really most fascinated about are the gods.
I could keep going, after all, this is a really huge novel and so much happens, but suffice to say, nations fall, the fate of so many tortured souls and gods and everyone else is at stake.
Firstly, this is so seriously jam packed with info and reveals from the first book that I found myself having to scan GotM quite frequently.
Erikson packs soooooo much into these books that it's quite impressive.
Characters- we see the return of most of our favorites from GotM!
Caladan Brood being my favorite new character.
I think Silverfox, later in the novel, is probably the only character I didn't like.
But that's all I can say on that, because spoilers lol.
World building is also where Erikson shines.
But seriously, he tips them from your chest.
But still, I'm 'nonetheless,' chuffed by the role and the opportunity to steal scenes left, right, and center."Stonny Menackis: "I still negotiating with Steven Erikson for a spin off story worthy of my charisma.
Pick any card.' - never trust an author, a shifty, ruthless, untrustworthy creature, the lot of them."Quick Ben: "It was a pretty demanding set of scenes, really tested me, but I think I've pulled through OK, and I'm looking forward to the next engagement, but I'm missing Kalam, I must catch up with him some time soon.
This was the best Malazan book so far.
Steven Erikson did a great job of weaving his gigantic cast of characters and complex plot and subplots into a cohesive fast paced and intriguing story.
The story picked up from where we left off in Gardens of the Moon.
As always it was massive, but this time around I was glad to return to the stories of the likable and interesting characters we met in Gardens of the Moon.
With all the pain and loss that fill this book, in this reread it is Itkovian who has moved me to tears the most often. In a series that abounds with memorable characters, this mortal man stands out as the epitome of honour and sacrifice. My horse, sir, my soldiers...
Simply one of the best books i ever read. Period. Erikson is a master storyteller in every aspect.
Maybe at some point in the future, maybe never, but despite being a huge fantasy fan and this being the ultimate fantasy series, it just is not for me.I scroll through the reviews of my friends and see that I'm absolutely in the minority (read: I think I'm the only one of my GR friends), but I just don't know what else to say.It did not captivate me.
The surviving people from the first book are back: Bridgeburners, Kruppe, Tool, Anomander Rake, Dujek, and Caladan Brood together with some new characters.
A big bad guy (and I do mean - BAD) is entering into the game - The Chained God. The threat of this is so big - some of the Elder Gods are coming back just to stop it.
It turns out - Quick Ben does not like the bad guy either and is determined to stop him.
Thus former enemies (Dujek and Caladan Brood) make an uneasy alliance.
Although Memories of Ice is considered by many to be the best of the Malazan books, I found it to be the weakest (edit, 2014: at least when I first wrote this review back in 2005 or so and had only read up to Midnight Tides.
This is so because of the following reasons:-The Mhybe storyline: Literally 150 pages of a character whining with nothing important happening.
In all though, Memories is the worst Malazan book so far, and could be vastly improved by cutting out 200 pages or so.
Together Lieutenant"Honourable Mentions:Korlat, Toc the younger, Tool, Gruntle & Stonny, those segulah (that the spelling?), those two Malazan soldiers that took over guarding silverfox (we never did learn their names),QuickBen, i want to add envy but that woman was like the annoying grown up version of Kruppe.
The woman was bloody annoying.Anyhoo, i definitely enjoyed it and i'm totally looking forward to book 4..p:s - i really think the plot of the book was way too divivded for the book to be called memories of ice so yes once again i'm calling it on title of book that really doesn't gel all the way with the plot.
"By your hand, the new game is begun. By your hand, the world shall tremble!" The third book in this (so far) stellar fantasy series brings the action and the focus back to the continent of Genabackis. There is a definite sense of familiarity here, to reward readers who have stuck with the series this far, with many of the characters we met in the first book returning here. Book one, Gardens of the Moon, mainly dealt with the conflict between the invading Malazan forces - led by Dujek One Arm’s

As an author, Steven Erikson has shown that he is not shy when it comes to depicting the horrors of war.
Erikson has managed to create a wealth of colorful and memorable characters on both sides of the Malazan/Genabackis conflict as well as the mortal/immortal divide.
