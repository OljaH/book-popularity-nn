David and his son Billy go out to get grocery store to get supplies after a bad storm has hit town.
Before leaving David had noticed a thick mist forming, and started to feel an apprehension building.
Figuring it was nothing David and Billy went for supplies but end up sequestered inside the grocery store after someone comes in screaming about the things in the mist.
I recently read The Thing and hated it but this one went over much better.
I also did like how it left off but someone told me the movie ending is a lot better.
My 100th read book this year.
King surely knows how to write characters you want to strangle, and then feel happy about it.
Even though I really liked the book I need to say one thing.
Since I've seen the movie before I read the book, I gotta say that, even though ending of the book was interesting, ending of the movie was done so much better and it literally left me speechless.But never mind that, I couldn't give this book any less than 5 stars, because I honestly think that it deserves every single star.
King is the king (ha-ha!) at writing stories that you can't stop reading, and with every book of his that I read, I gain more respect for the man.
I don't know, I liked the movie more than the book on this one.
Although, when I had the book on tape a million years ago it about scared me to death with all of the sound effects!
I think I would like to get a narrated version of it again!
It's been a really long time since I saw the movie but I just remember that it freaked me clean out and the book .
I don't know, who cares!
I also remember after this I never wanted to go out in the fog again!!!!!!
I used to fantasize about a zombie apocalypse after watching The Walking Dead.
I used to fantasize about winning the Hunger Games after watching the movies/reading the books.
I used to fantasize about alien invasions after watching alien movies.*Now I’m glad none of that happened because I wouldn’t have survived even an hour.
Thanks, but no thanks.*Though I can’t deny, the novel has a certain appeal.
So I fantasized again.
I imagined myself being there, alone or with certain people.
The supermarket had or had not supplies of certain stuff.
3.5 StarsOne of my friend's Dad used to throw a number of inspirational quotes all around to provide us with insight and direction to life and stuff. One of his favorites was: Don't be afraid to go into the mist, be excited because you don't know where you will end up.Clearly, he never had a chance to read The Mist.  ❝ In the dream I could hear the rending crack and splinter of breaking trees as God stamped the woods into the shape of His footsteps. He was circling the lake, coming toward the Br
He was circling the lake, coming toward the Bridgton side, toward us, and all the houses and cottages and summer places were bursting into purple-white flame like lightning, and soon the smoke covered everything.
The smoke covered everything like a mist.❞
It's a classic horror structure, and King does it quite well.Unfortunately, I had watched the 2007 movie adaptation of the story many times while I was in uni.
It was one of gang's favorite movie and we always had conversations which went like: "Dude, remember The Mist's ending?
One another thing King nails here is the mob mentality and the way people act under the pressure of horrors.
This slip cased hardcover book is numbered 458 of 500 and is signed by artist Herbert Brandmeier on the title page.Nebel is the German word for fog. This is the First World Hard cover separate edition of the book, which I purchased at Forbidden Planet book shop, while on a business trip to London, England in 1986. Shortly after publication, Mr. King had customs officials destroy most copies for copyright infringement. It was first published as the first and longest story of the 1980 horror anthology Dark Forces. A slightly edited version was included in King's 1985 collection Skeleton Crew.
3.5 Misty StarsThe Mist was my first read by Stephen King.
Well I loved the writing.
It keeps you read it uninterrupted.
I really didn’t expect the author ends it like that!
And by that I meant so open!The story is about a man, named David, that after a hurricane with his son and his neighbor goes to a supermarket and leaves his wife at home.
But when they are at the supermarket, there is a weird fog everywhere.
It’s a stand-alone novel.
All in all, I enjoyed it (except the ending) hope you like it more than me!
Starting off this year's October (horror month) with a classic author for when you want to shiver: Stephen King.I already know the story because I watched the movie adaptation many moons ago so I knew I would like it.The story is that after a massive storm the titular mist closes in on a community in Maine, but it is no ordinary mist and with it come unspeakable horrors, trapping a number of people in a supermarket.Stephen King managed to make the supermarket very chilly and claustrophic, giving this novella a wonderfully haunting atmosphere.
Μια περίεργη ομίχλη σκεπάζει το χτυπημένο από όλα τα κακά του κόσμου Μέην και οι κάτοικοί του δέχονται επίθεση από «χαριτωμένα» όντα όπως τεράστιες αράχνες, έντομα με μέγεθος Γκοτζίλα, χταπόδια της στεριάς και άλλα νηστίσιμα τερατάκια.Ωραίο βιβλίο, πέρασε ευχάριστα η ώρα.
Just now getting to the novella, I'm relieved that it's better and isn't cursed with the horrible celluloid ending.One of the best perks is I didn't have to listen to as much detaield spiel from that religious woman, who goes down as one of the most annoying characters in horror movie history.The characters are fine - child is cute and convincing, the MC strong enough although he does distract himself with carnal cravings, and there's the fun disbonding groups do when they face trouble together.Creepy mist is creepy - there are some nightmarish monsters out there, especially horrible for those like me who detest spiders.
I decided to read this book, because it's shorter than a lot of the other Stephen King books.
For some reason I do like to read horror books.
Stephen King writes so lively, that I feel completely engrossed into his books when I read them.
When you can write a book that makes you scared, you do have an immense gift as a writer.
The thought about being stuck in this mist is terrifying.
Just the thought makes me shiver, and next time their will be mist where I live I will think completely different about it.
As a species we're fundamentally insane. Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another. Why do you think we invented politics and religion?  The Mist is a novella mainly about survival and it is a terrifying one at that. Because how do one fight off something like the mist and the creatures that came with it?David and his young son Billy happened to be one of a few survivors holing up in a supermarket with more than 80 other people. For his
Because how do one fight off something like the mist and the creatures that came with it?David and his young son Billy happened to be one of a few survivors holing up in a supermarket with more than 80 other people.
For his son's sake, David has to decide whether to stay inside (where resources and companions are plentiful) or to go outside (where Death is a high risk) and seek a way to find help.
But inside the supermarket, people are starting to get unhinged.
The story ended hopefully - whether David, his son and the others survive to live another day is entirely up to the readers to decide.
Una novela bastante corta de Stephen King que me gustó muchísimo, super entretenida y en algunos momentos incluso me llegué a asustar.Las primeras hojas son un poco lentas pero una vez que llegan al supermercado todo se vuelve un hermoso caos Me gustó mucho el final personalmente, sé que hay gente que no le gusta pero a mi shi
The Mist is so much more than just horror.
It's a short story and yet, like its fantastic 2007 feature film, it's probably one of the best studies of how humans act when all the little comforts of everyday life are ripped away from them.
To quote Ollie from the book, "as a species we're fundamentally insane.
Throw us all into a room together and we start picking sides and dreaming up ways to kill one another." Indeed, the biggest threat to David Drayton and his small group of friends trapped in a supermarket is not the violent monsters or the hoards of insects, but instead a religious fanatic, a group of small town rednecks and of course, those who deny that there is even anything in the mist at all.
Great book. The film was good too. The ripping of the veil and the monsters flood in. 🐯👍
This was my first Stephen King novel I have read so far. And for me, it was a definite 4 stars.I think his writing and storytelling lives up to what people say and I understand where people are coming from when they say King is the 'King of Horror'. Gripping, emotional and you never know what's about to happen. I bloody loved it! I'm ready to delve more into King's novels as they have now peaked my interest and I hope I discover more great things in his other stories. Away!
Because I can't tell, but I know I want to punch the narrator any time he says anything about his wife or any other women - it's all got this snobby air of protective superiority, and it's skeeving me out.Also, five-year-olds do not talk like that.
Or there'll be some emotionally-fraught scene of potential character growth and the narrator will be off and running with some story about his hot wife and the futility of art.
And I DID NOT CARE.That was the worst thing about this - King really wanted me to care about these characters, and he kept throwing in details to manipulate me into liking them, and it was so obvious.
The second place the film excels over the source material (and this will be apparent to anyone who has seen/read both version of this story) is the ending.
I’ll spare the spoilers for anyone who hasn’t seen, but it’s fucked up.Having only read this one book, it seems to me that Stephen King’s greatest strength as a writer is his almost limitless imagination.
I can only imagine how bad these nonsense details are in some of his longer works which are undoubtedly bloated to fill some sort of expected page count.That said, once the *actual* story gets going, it moves along smoothly and effortlessly.
And I’m looking forward to reading something I HAVEN’T seen the movie of.
Υπάρχει ΚΑΤΙ στην ομίχλη!
Υπάρχει ΚΑΤΙ ΜΕΣΑ στην ομίχλη!
Κάτι που έφερε μαζί της, κρύβοντάς το στα κατάλευκα πέπλα της, κάτι που διαχέεται απειλητικά στο δυτικό Μαίην, σκορπώντας τρόμο, θάνατο και απόγνωση."Είναι ο Θάνατος!
Κι ένα ακροατήριο εύπιστων χωριατών δείχνει πρόθυμο και ικανό να πραγματοποιήσει κάθε παραλογισμό της 'μάγισσας': θυσία αίματος!Υπάρχει άραγε διέξοδος και σωτηρία; Θα υποχωρήσει η ομίχλη και πότε; Θα αποκατασταθεί τελικά η ομαλότητα των πραγμάτων; Η απάντηση στη νουβέλα του King είναι διαφορετική από την αντίστοιχη της κινηματογραφικής μεταφοράς του Darabont (The mist, 2007).
Οπότε, ακόμη κι αν έχετε δει την ταινία, διαβάστε και το βιβλίο.
Već nakon par stranica , King uspjeva stvoriti jednu mračnu atmosferu koja traje sve do kraja.
Opasnost koja vreba vani zbog magle ( a i samim tim i sa čudovištima koji se nalaze vani ) najbolje je prikazana u scenama koji se dešavaju u supermarktetu gdje se strah tih ljudi doslovno može osjetiti.Vrhunac mi je onaj monstrum koji je veliki kao dinosaurus ( Cthulhu inspiracija ?
).Eh sad , kraj knjige mi je bio dobar...
I tu moram uporedit ovaj kraj , sa onim krajem u filmu koji je bio ...
(view spoiler)[Iako se da pretpostaviti da će se okupljena grupa ljudi verovatno podeliti na manje grupacije, potpuno mi je fantasnična opcija da bilo ko od njih poveruje osobi koja propoveda o krvnoj žrtvi i potom počne da podržava tu opciju.
(view spoiler)[ Možda je razlika u tome što su bića iz magle prikazana tek povremeno i dozirano, na vrhuncima napetosti, dok su zombiji u drugoj priči daleko prisutniji i uticajniji.
A možda je i razlika u tome što su u pitanju vanzenmaljci protiv ljudi koji postaju vanzenmaljski odašiljači i igračke, preciznije, element dehumanizacije.
Ο Βασιλιάς γράφει μια δυστοπική ιστορία που ενώ φαντάζει απλή, εντούτοις καταφέρνει να περάσει τα μηνύματά του σχετικά με την καταστροφή του περιβάλλοντος και τις συνέπειες που σίγουρα θα έχει αυτή για την ανθρωπότητα, να διαμορφώσει πλήρεις χαρακτήρες και όχι καρικατούρες, να δημιουργήσει συναισθήματα και κλειστοφοβική ατμόσφαιρα, και να γελοιοποιήσει και σατιρίσει για άλλη μια φορά τον αμερικάνικο τρόπο ζωής και την αμερικάνικη αφέλεια (ή βλακεία)!
ΟΚ, δεν μιλάμε για μια από τις κορυφαίες του στιγμές, όμως η αρτιότητα της ιστορίας είναι αξιομνημόνευτη.
Διαβάστε το (7/10).Υ.Γ.: Εξακολουθώ να πιστεύω - και πάντα θα υποστηρίζω - ότι ο Κινγκ είναι καλύτερος όταν μιλάει για τα εγκόσμια και αφηγείται ιστορίες καθημερινές, παρά όταν γράφει για φαντάσματα και τέρατα, που προσωπικά δεν με πείθουν...
Un angosciante racconto breve dal Re dell'horror, che ha ispirato un bellissimo film del 2007 ed una
Tiesa, 1990 metais viena itin sėkminga ekranizacija jau buvo, tad iš naujosios nieko mažiau nesitikiu.
Apie kiekvieną iš jų trumpai:1)	“Kukurūzų vaikai“;Taip jau nutiko, kad pirmasis siaubo filmas kurį mačiau ir buvo „Kukurūzų vaikai“ („Children of the corn“).
Ir jis man tada pasirodė toks baisus, toks kraupus, kad užsimaniau ir visas kitas jo dalis pažiūrėti (taip, jų yra kelios).
Bet pirmoji filmo dalis būtent ir yra šio King‘o apsakymo ekranizacija.
Tačiau vaikas ant kelio guli ne tik parblokštas mašinos, bet ir perpjauta gerklę.
Nesakau, jog „Rūkas“ yra blogas apsakymas – ne , jis net labai stiprus.
A fascinating and tormenting tale. What caused the mist? What was it made of? Did the 4 people who made it out of the supermarket survive? There are no answers to these questions which might possibly leave an opening for a sequel?
BEWARE. The creatures.... of.... THE MIST. Anyway, we all know that this was originally a short story in  . A story of men fucking with nature/forces beyond their knowledge, and basically causing the world to go to hell in a handbasket. There is blood, gore, death, guts, entrails, and terror. Typical Mr. King fun.However, the ending of the movie version actually works better for me in this case. If you haven't seen it or read the book do not click on the spoiler link.(view spoiler)[I mean seriou

The Mist is a perfect book to read for the creeptastic month of screamtober.
I remember the first time I read "The Mist" (in the Skeleton Crew collection) that I was floored by how well King captured how human beings end up turning on each other in a crisis.
This whole book is pretty much an adult "Lord of the Flies."Told in the first person, David Drayton tells how the Mist came to their little corner of the world.
I think it's because as an adult I have definitely met this character in real life more times than I would like to even admit to myself.I also thought how well King showed how many people just to protect their own sanity refuse to even believe what has happened and instead blame others around them (Brenton).The writing was typical King and to me that is not a complaint.
The Mist is a great monster story.
After a nasty storm a strange mist appears.
It isn't surprising, then, that you get a couple of stereotypical characters (an old crazy doom-sayer, a lawyer who is full of himself, a unassuming good guy and so on).
The protagonist is stuck with his five-year-old son there.As I said, it is a great monster story.
Unfortunately, in a story like this I need to root for the main character or at least to accept his actions on some level.
It didn't move the story forward.
Well that was fun to listen. If you have already read the book I suggest giving this a try. It's pretty short and pretty fun to listen to on a short ride (like I did).
It puts you on edge, waiting to find out what comes hurtling around the pike.And like in Under the Dome, King is interested in what happens when people are trapped in a space together, in how logic & rationality breaks down and fear takes its place, as civility is scoured away and leaves behind animal instinct and panic.
All things serve the beam.Fifth book of my Horror Aficionados reading challenge.Favourite quotes below, spoilery per usual:(view spoiler)[One of those terrible visions came to me--I think they are reserved exclusively for husbands and fathers--of the picture window blowing in with a low, hard coughing sound and sending jagged arrows of glass into my wife's bare stomach, into my boy's face and neck.
