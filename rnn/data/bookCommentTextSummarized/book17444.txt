Those 26 letters get mashed about or organised, which ever way you look at it and form words.
Whether you can think of that word straight away or you have to sit with your feelings there is always a word.
Ego Maniac was perfectly poignant, breathtakingly beautiful and sinfully sexy.Just before hitting the halfway mark I realised that this book was my new Vi Keeland favourite.
I have fallen HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE with Drew Jagger.
It took me 5 hours to devour Ego Maniac, and if you ask me that was way too short.
Ego Maniac brings all the feels and more.

Consider me smitten, charmed, seduced, and utterly romanced by this story, by these characters. Hands down one of the sweetest, most enjoyable, most heartfelt and well crafted reads I've read.

Consider me smitten, charmed, seduced, and utterly romanced by this story, by these characters.
I CANNOT imagine a single person not falling head over heels in love with Emerie and Drew.
I haven't read all of her books, but I definitely adored THE BALLER, almost had a mental meltdown over the perfection that was STUCK UP SUIT (she co-authors that with Penelope Ward) and really enjoyed BOSSMAN.
Another story that's not just sex, but actual story with pure heart and full bodied characters that are such a delight to read, they make you want to skip around in joy.

⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2! Egomaniac (stand-alone). Dirty-talker Drew & small-town girl Emerie share an office space & fall into bed!   “Oh my God. Drew’s penis was so wide and long it looked like he was carrying a whiffle ball bat.”   Egomaniac (stand-alone) follows divorce attorney Drew Michael Jagger and marriage counselor Emerie Rose after they find themselves sharing a Park Avenue office space.Polar opposites in every way they find themselves on a collision course all the way to the bedroom, while se
Egomaniac (stand-alone) follows divorce attorney Drew Michael Jagger and marriage counselor Emerie Rose after they find themselves sharing a Park Avenue office space.Polar opposites in every way they find themselves on a collision course all the way to the bedroom, while secrets and painful past prevent them from moving past fuck-buddies.
Love Drew Michael Jagger’s mouth, but there is much more behind his aversion to relationships to unfold with story.
Seven words to describe Drew: sarcastic, blunt, non-committal, thoughtful, loyal, private and dirty-talker.Seven words to describe  Emerie Rose: naïve, reflective, trusting, feisty, impulsive, prudish and OCD.Egomaniac, told from dual POVs, is an opposites attract erotic romance.
ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review Egomaniac is a sexy blend of sophistication, banter, friendship, love, and steam. Vi Keeland has once again slayed the book world as she brings forth one romance that will have readers begging for Drew Jagger and his dirty-talking mouth.

Vi Keeland has once again slayed the book world as she brings forth one romance that will have readers begging for Drew Jagger and his dirty-talking mouth.
It takes Emerie awhile to see that her crush and infatuation with this man is nothing compared to her friendship and attraction to Drew.
Drew Jagger was the epitome of ultimate book boyfriend when it came to his affection for Emerie Rose.
So if you are looking for a love story that blends heart, romance, and steam then this book is definitely for you.
Drew, at 29, has an office and a penthouse flat on park avenue.
Who moved to NYC because a guy she fancied herself in love with had recently relocated there.
Much like Alexa Riley with insta-love and Jordan Silver with caveman heroes, Keeland usually has a villainous ex-wife or as was the case in Bossman, a deceased GF.
Emerie being the saintly woman who would follow- for love- any man to anywhere and Alexa as the woman who would follow the man purely for cash.
You may wonder if I liked anything about the book.
4.5 Stars!!If you haven’t read this author before, then you should definitely rectify that. ASAP!! Because trust me, you don’t want to miss the awesomeness of Vi Keeland. I’ve read several books by this author and I enjoyed every single one of them, but 'Egomaniac' might be her best book to date. I loved the f@ck out of this book! It was definitely my kind of romcom and I hope Mrs. Keeland never stops writing them.  “I have moves. I swear. I’m just all sorts of off tonight because of everything
I’ve read several books by this author and I enjoyed every single one of them, but 'Egomaniac' might be her best book to date.
Apparently, she’s not really an intruder since someone, a scammer, leased her Drew’s office space for a large amount of money.Emerie feels like crap.
was sweet, sexy, with just a little drama, delightful interactions, witty banter and two main characters I loved from the very beginning.
It made me smile, grin and laugh and even swoon a little and I honestly had a blast reading Drew and Emerie’s journey to happiness.I loved Drew and Emerie – individually and together.
::: FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: I can't stop smiling!!! This amazingly addictive book was SEXY, FUN and FULL OF FEELS!! Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. With its cocky, jaded, dirty-talking attorney hero and sassy, fiery heroine who argued, bantered, and slowly fell in love, and a surprisingly emotional twist to the story, it was a perfect romantic reading escape.

With its cocky, jaded, dirty-talking attorney hero and sassy, fiery heroine who argued, bantered, and slowly fell in love, and a surprisingly emotional twist to the story, it was a perfect romantic reading escape.
If you're looking for a great new book to escape into, I highly recommend this one!!Now, I could give you my explanation of what the story is about, but to be honest, I love the blurb so much that I'm going to let it speak for itself...
DOn’t forget to tell them I’m strong, too.
“One.”“You like it when I’m angry?”“I find it turns me on.
Finds a woman in a storage room of his office re-arranging some shit.
Turns out the woman, aka Emerie, did, in fact, rent out the office in question.
Long story short, people, Drew takes pity on her and lets her run her practice from his office in exchange for her answering his business calls.
➦So what happens when Drew, who handles divorces for a living , and Emerie, who helps people salvage marriages through counseling, become friends?
There are a lot of other things in this book that contributed to the character development and made me drool all over the kindle feel completely engaged with the story.
*****FOUR STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by Author}(BR with Mel)I couldn’t explain why I felt things for Drew any more than I could explain the taste of water.

EGOMANIAC is the story of one sexy as hell New York City divorce attorney and a sweet but utterly naïve psychologist, who specializes in couples counseling, who end up sharing office space through highly unusual circumstances.
After things are cleared up between Drew and Emerie, he ends up helping her out of a jam in court.
Aside from being a knockout, there’s something about Emerie that has Drew wanting to protect her, so he ends up letting her use one of his offices while she tries to save up and find an affordable office elsewhere.
➳Vi Keeland makes a comeback with a BA-BAYAM with this new exotic novel… ➳You may think that the synopsis says it all when it comes down to the story of Drew M. Jagger, a divorce attorney and Emerie Rose, a psychologist specialized in the field of couples in need of help with their relationships- counseling them on how to fix their relationships. Finding themselves in a situation that is completely awkward, screams destiny putting them together, Drew and Emerie have a spark going on from the ve
Finding themselves in a situation that is completely awkward, screams destiny putting them together, Drew and Emerie have a spark going on from the very beginning of their existence together.
Even though their jobs put them in a situation that is rather ironic to be seen together, Vi Keeland makes the exception with these two by providing a powerful love story.
➳It starts off by providing a small background story of why Drew and Emerie are the people they are.
Their friendship begins to evolve when Emerie is in trouble and Drew, the sweetheart he is, helps her out and gets out of trouble.
Or that it wasn't good.
Just another good romance.It is well-written and the characters are interesting and likable.
The story is good too.
Sure, there were parts I liked less, but the overall impression was good.
I love how the author incorporated the past chapters into the book.
The past chapters were short and to the point without detracting from the unfolding plot.
I loved the first half half of the book: it was funny, hot and refreshing.
I loved the characters and their banter.
Overall, a good read which didn't quite reach its full potential.
My absolute favorite Vi Keeland book ever!
Turns out that she rented the place and paid a large sum of money to a scammer!It's my first time to read a book where both characters have opposing nature of work (Drew as a divorce attorney and Emerie as a marriage counselor) and I loved it because it showed a unique characterization.
Those conflicts made Drew and Emerie become a good team.
I enjoyed watching them work their issues out.As this book fell into the workplace romance trope, the way they worked together in one place where it's fueled with sexual tension was a bit crazy, too.
4.5 Drew & Emerie STARS Vi Veeland delivers a truly enjoyable romance story that incorporates all the qualities that romance fans look for in a light yet heartfelt sexy read. The hero is a divorce attorney who only takes male clients while our heroine is a marriage counselor trying hard to mend broken marriages. A great play on the opposite attract concept. ”You’re an idealist. I’m a realist.” Emerie finds herself out office space and money when she's scammed into thinking she rented this Pa
4.5 Drew & Emerie STARS Vi Veeland delivers a truly enjoyable romance story that incorporates all the qualities that romance fans look for in a light yet heartfelt sexy read.
By Drew Jagger’s good graces she ends up sharing his work space until she can find a new location for her practice.
Drew Jagger is a great hero, he was unique while being relatable and super sexy to boot.
Our heroine, Emerie Rose had relocated to New York in the hopes that her friend Baldwin will see her in a romantic light.
As Emerie said, Drew is   " thriving on misogynistic tendencies he developed because of his lying, cheating ex-wife, and attempts to extricate men from their failed marriages by leaving their women penniless."  Because of his past experiences, he is like a machine, never allowing him to fell in love again.
He is scared and Emerie presence in his life felt right for the first time in many years.They become good friends and of course the attraction in palpable, mainly from Drew's side.
AND, Emerie didn't convince be to be so in love with Drew also..
So, I said “why not?”I wouldn’t mind reading something really funny this Saturday about another arrogant, self center alpha male who is making the life of the girl hell, because deep down he really wants her and wants to have babies with her.Thus, I started the book and there is this first scene where they meet for the first time.
They had their cute moments, you know coworkers become fuck buddies and then they have feelings and suddenly it is less like “just-sex” and it is more like a “real-relationship”.
Absolutely yes, now that I know what to expect.Will I read another book by this author?
It was SO GOOD!So Egomaniac is the story of Drew Jagger and Emerie Rose, a hot office romance you don't want to miss!
I hated his ex-wife SO MUCH, OMG it made me love Drew even more when he fighted for what he wants (you'll know what I am talking about if you read the book).
And going back to Drew and Emerie's relationship, as always, when feelings got involved in the mix, Egomaniac got even better for me!
A wonderful love story full of sexy times, all the feels and a couple with overwhelming chemistry!
A new standalone novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Vi Keeland. EGO MANIAC:   This review is going to be as spoiler free as I possibly can do it. A few quotes here and there, and a brief overview of what's to come when you one click this, but there's so much more to this book than what my review divulges.  We're first introduced to Drew Jagger (not related to Mick Jagger) who had just arrived back in Manhattan on News Year's Eve after being on a 2 week holiday in Hawaii in the
For a crazy person - now that I was looking - she was pretty damn cute.Fiery red hair piled on top of her head seemed to match her firecracker personality.
So if you're after a laugh out loud, feels good book then this is one you won’t want to miss!!
This is probably my favorite book to date by this author, I read this in record time, once I started I couldn't put it down.
If you're after a hot alpha male with sex on the brain and a dirty mouth, and a feisty red head look no further than this book, believe me it won't disappoint!!
*****5 Stars***** “Sometimes what you’re looking for comes when you’re not looking at all.” UNKNOWN.  I absolutely loved “Egomanic.” I’m literally on a massive book high. It’s really no surprise to me considering Vi Keeland is one of my all-time favourite authors. She has the innate ability to draw me in to her amazing stories from the very first page. Her books are always fun, sexy and somewhat emotional. From the moment I started reading this book I couldn’t put it down. I love all of her book
It seems her books just get better and better.This amazing story unfolds with Drew Jagger arriving back to Manhattan after holidaying in Hawaii, only to discover a squatter setting up camp in his office suite.
Their first encounter was absolutely hilarious, especially when Emerie tries to take out Drew with her Krav Maga skills.
It comes to light that Emerie leased the office space, but was scammed by her ‘supposed’ agent.
Drew doesn’t help matters when he points out to her how naïve she is, thinking she can rent office space in Park Avenue for what she paid her agent.
Plus the sassy heroine and jerky but not really jerky hero were perfect!Emery had just moved to NYC and was setting up her new office space when a sexy intruder made her realize that she'd been conned.
Instead of getting a really good deal on the perfect place to meet with her marriage counseling clients, she's actually inhabiting divorce lawyer Drew Jagger's newly remodeled office space.
These two polar opposites: Drew, bitter and angry, and Emery, hopeful and sweet, build a relationship neither expects.
And through their friendship, the sexual tension between them builds and sparks fly.I seriously loved everything about this book.
It's already owned by a verrry hot lawyer guy!Now she's back on the street - minus 10k for rent and minus 250$ for the adorable stationary she already ordered with her new Park Avenue address!!!!But Drew feels a bit sorry for the pretty lady.After helping her file a complaint against the bad guy who took her money, Drew offers her the use of his offices.
Drew is not one for feelings but he has a lot of them whenever he sees his new red-headed-office-mate.WHAT WiLL HAPPEN TO EMERiE & DREW????WiLL THERE BE A HAPPILY EVER AFTER?READ THE BOOK TO FiND OUT!
A beguiling romantic comedy not to be missed. Keeland’s vivacity comes to the fore with witty, flirty dialogue which is tempered with heartwarming moments full of all the feels.   Emery Rose moved from Oklahoma to New York to be close to the man she’s been infatuated with for the past three years. She found a great deal on Park Avenue office space and was almost ready to start her new life until someone attempted to break into her office on New Year’s Eve. It quickly became apparent that Emery
She found a great deal on Park Avenue office space and was almost ready to start her new life until someone attempted to break into her office on New Year’s Eve. It quickly became apparent that Emery had been the victim of a scam and when Drew offered her to stay until she found a new place in exchange for light secretarial work, she couldn’t turn him down.
Egomaniac made me laugh, smile, swoon and even giggle from the start to finish with its charming characters and sweet plot even though I had some initial doubts.When I first met Emery I thought I wouldn’t be able to relate much with her.
4.5 Stars!(BR with Patty) Drew Jagger is a 29 yr. old successful attorney in New York. He lives and works in a building on Park Avenue that's considered prime real estate in NYC. He returns home from a vacation to find a beautiful feisty woman in his office. While he was out of town his office space was to be renovated.

He comes back to this woman accusing him of being an intruder.Emerie Rose freaks out when she thinks a man is breaking into her new office she just rented about a week ago.
Drew offers to let Emerie help him out while his secretary is on leave in exchange for rent.
As a psychologist, Emerie was in the business of repairing relationships, while Drew helped to destroy them as a divorce attorney.
But beautiful fit the bill to describe Drew Jagger-no other word did him justice.-Never in my life had I felt so much desire.
This "I know this will happen now" feeling of mine totally decreased my joy of reading.I don’t want to do any injustice to the book and I know many people will love it, because there is not much to criticize and it is mostly fun so maybe I have read too many similar books to it and that is why, it sounded unoriginal to me… My actual grading is 3,5 but because it never felt like a "4", I am giving it 3 stars (I really wish gr would give us the opportunity of half stars )You can still give it a try whenever in the mood for a sweet and fun romance with a little angst.
Because it takes one to know one.” “Do women tend to find your behavior attractive?” “I’m handsome and rich.
Well I liked it but it’s not my favorite Vi Keeland book (Bossman was soooo good!). But still I really enjoyed Drew & Emerie’s story. If you wanna read funny and also a sexy story, you should give a chance this book! :)
Emerie Rose; a marriage counselor recently relocated to New York and thought she got the deal of a lifetime on a new office only to find out it was all a scam.
Emerie was physically attracted to Drew and his funny ego charming ways won her over as well.
This story is super funny, sexy and enjoyable.
I honestly loved it; readers who are looking for a light sexy read look no more this book has it all.
The couples are just hilarious; their chemistry is incredible and sexy ego Drew will have you laughing so hard and then hot and bothered with his filthy dirty mouth.
RATING: ALL THE HEARTS!! <3Egomaniac is a story that highlights all the things Ms. Keeland does oh-so well, her dynamic writing a beautiful amalgamation of humour, friendship, love, toe-curling passion, and the fondest of heartaches.    Sometimes what you’re looking for comes when you’re not looking at all. - Unknown   Emerie is a woman whose admirable strength of will in the face of adversity holds us captivated, and though she has been conned out of all of her money and has no office space
<3Egomaniac is a story that highlights all the things Ms. Keeland does oh-so well, her dynamic writing a beautiful amalgamation of humour, friendship, love, toe-curling passion, and the fondest of heartaches.
Individually and professionally, both Emerie and Drew could not be more of a paradox—she’s fiery to his finesse, and where she works to keep marriages together, he breaks them apart—yet together they’re nothing short of stunning.
Overall, Egomaniac is hugely entertaining, a story that is cleverly witty, sexy, and touching in equal measure and one that will undoubtedly resonate with fans of Vi Keeland and those new to her work.
What to say that hasn't been already said. This book rocked, it hooked me from page one, its hot, sexy, and beautiful in so many ways. Without giving much away to those that have not yet got to read this gem, my only hang up in the book was the ending, how quick Emerie forgave. That's it, otherwise I'm in love, and not just in love with the cover ❤❤ ❤
It literally has all of my favorites all rolled into one book!Drew Jagger, like the title suggests, is an egomaniac, but still so freaking lovable.
Emerie Rose is a psychologist who specializes in marriage counseling and is the perfect opposite for Drew Jagger the divorce attorney.
Drew is completely taken with Emerie, she is nothing like any other woman he has ever met and agrees to help her out.
I felt Drew and Emerie connection grow over time and loved how they developed this flirty friendship at first.
I just loved Drew and Emerie.
