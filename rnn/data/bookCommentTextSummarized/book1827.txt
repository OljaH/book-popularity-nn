The first writer treated, after an essay on books, is Henry James.
Particularly the latter still makes for great reading because of Conrad’s mourning for the lost passengers and seamen mixed with his white-hot scorn for the irresponsible “bigger is better” marketing of the commercial interests.Conrad is a great writer, but very much of his time.
As I read the first few essays in the section, my interest waned.
This essay alone made the book worth reading.
Five stars for it and the Henry James and first of the Titanic essays, three stars overall.
Is it such a very mad presumption to believe in the sovereign power of one's art, to try for other means, for other ways of affirming this belief in the deeper appeal of one's work?
The account of a life of a writer of Polish heritage and the story of how he ultimately decided to write in English is something that has deep personal resonance for me.
So yes, if you are fond of Joseph Conrad (and especially if you are fond of pondering the problem of his Polish heritage), do please read this book.
