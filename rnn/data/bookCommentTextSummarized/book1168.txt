A blank canvas and a discriminatory behavior encouraged by narrow-minded adults.Among other things, it is a short story about how loud, obnoxious snobs are created. And how to look for exceptions.Nov 19, 2015This is not a review for me, just me being lazy but still wanting to say something...
The main character, Kezia and her sisters were given a big doll house by Mrs Hay and they were really happy.
If you are given a doll house by patents or relatives, does it make you happy?Of course yes!
Kezia took her school friends to her house and showed them her big cute doll house.
If you have a cute doll house and really like it, do you want to show it to your friends?Probably yes, if I was child and I had a big cute doll house, I would have wanted to show it to my friends and play with doll.
Title: The Doll's HouseAuthor: Katherine MansfieldType of text: short storyI liked how it has a detailed explanation about the Doll’s house which made me imagine. I thought it was really sad that there was a big difference between upper class people and lower class people in their community. I would recommend this book because it makes you think deeply about lower classes and upper classes in the community.
The story is about discrimination faced by the lower class in a community. These kind of discriminations do happen world over in almost all the societies. But the children don't understand this and rightly so. I wish whole world acted like children in such a situation.
برعکس بقیه بچه ها که فرش های قرمز، صندلی های قرمز و پنجره های طلایی زینت بخش خانه را تحسین می کنند، کیزیا دختر کوچک خانه، تنها مجذوب لامپ ساده ای شده است که در این خانه قرار دارد.خانه عروسکی، کانون جلب توجهایزابل، بزرگ ترین دختر خانواده در مدرسه توسط بچه های دیگر احاطه می شود.
در حالی که بقیه مجذوب دیگر اجزاء خوش رنگ و لعاب خانه شده اند، از نظر کیزیا تنها شیء بی نقص خانه این لامپ است.

I can remember reading it's translation in my sister's notebook long time ago and took it on my heart so badly that today the pain of class difference is again being irrigated.
Powerful short about the ugly and beautiful things in life.
Loved, loved, loved Kezia! 💕

A story of prejudice among social classes being passed through generations. Humbling.
Read for my Language Arts class... Overall quite an enjoyable read. It really shows what society is like even to this day in a creative way.
The three Burnell girls got as a present a beautiful doll’s house.
Pristine in their small details, they were the pride and joy as well as the tool of inciting envy on every other little girl who went to their school.
She pitied the only two girls excluded from partaking the fun and she wanted them to see the doll house just like the others.
Their garments were second-handed and they were slighted not only by parents of the other children, but the teacher and by the other girls.
The viciousness of children, of small girls, is poignant.
I read The Doll's House for school and must write an essay on the topic of the disparity between the adult world and that of a child.To be honest, I really didn't like the story.
It was mercifully short, but the way my notes make it out to be so clever and brilliant make its mediocrity stand out more than it normally would.
I've read much better short stories and this one doesn't seem as "deep" as the teacher wants me to believe.
The theme of the adult world vs.
the child world doesn't seem as important as the more obvious themes of class distinction and/or bullying.
"The Doll's House" is an easy read, at least at first sight. But the doll's house a mighty symbol. The way it opens, the lamp, its opulence, its materialistic value, its exclusiveness in terms of who can contemplate it and who can't, raise a lot of issues about class consciousness, poverty, and humanity. Another interesting theme is the kids' dual nature. Still another is their way of imitating the adults. And, of course, sisterly relations.
I would describe the feeling as poignant. I care less about the dollhouse and its owners than I do about the two little outcasts (as intended) . Girls can be so cruel. The story reminds us that sometimes great strides begin with a single step. (view spoiler)[The two outcasts do get to see the dollhouse - thanks to one of the younger sisters who feels empathy for them. While it turns out less than well the fact remains that they get to see the dollhouse and that in itself has meaning. (hide spoiler)]
I liked this story as it was short and easy to read i found it sad as how this story was set with the different classes and a higher class person does not talk to a lower class person. it was a little bit confusing,
I think the start of this story was lovely how they put so much detail into explaining the doll house but the end/middle was quite sad how there was such a diffrence from low and middle classes in their community
The main idea of the story is very sad.But I find it hard too decipher the underlying connotations of the story.
I think that the dolls house is a cute idea and i felt sorry for the girls who were left out because of who thier parents were.This is a short story.
Very very sad. Reminded me of To Kill A Mockingbird as well as Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye. Little children can be cruel. Thank goodness for the Kezias.
Type of text: It is a really sad story but i Do not get it. I recommend this for people who likes an easy read.
alguns contos muito bons, outros menos ( não gostei muito de "revelações"- será por ser uma tradução?)
better...
I seen the lamp.http://www.theguardian.com/books/audi...
I have arranged my thoughts into a haiku:"Outside the doll house,Peace is for those looking in--On those with repute."
