Thankfully, it wasn't like that and the story moved along quite nicely, once Malory and her newfound friends/partners Dana and Zoe, the heroines in the following books in the series, were presented with the task they were supposed to do: find the keys that would release the souls of three demigoddesses who had been imprisoned hundreds of years ago.
I'm not going into details here, but the tale about their lives was very charming and romantic - regardless of the sad ending, that is.Flynn, Dana's brother, joined the quest for the keys in no time, even though he was skeptical about the whole thing...
DEAR Ms. Roberts,I totally believe that two people who have spent a whole summer jumping out of planes and escaping DEATH BY FIRE together on a daily basis might fall in love and get married after knowing each other for only a few months.It also seems plausible that you might fall in love with a guy who had a crush on you in high school, or even possibly your car mechanic, but deciding to marry this random dude with an annoying dog three weeks after you met him, just because you went on some wackadoo fairy quest with him and had sex on an ugly couch?Unplausible.Also, stuff like, "I can walk three miles in these heels.
No love, Jenne
I'd like to start by thanking my lovely friend Celeste for making me discover one of her favorite authors and feel-good series!
The writing flowed easily and told the story of Malory, Dana and Zoe, 3 passionate women, thrown into a strange and almost impossible quest.My favorite aspect of the book was the dynamics between the female characters!
#Friendshipgoals I know that must sound like a Utopian and naive fantasy on my part, but this comfort was exactly what I have been looking for and expecting from this series: an uncomplicated, a tad predictable and rather cute read.
As my friend Celeste says about Nora's books, in her Come Sundown review:"
alot happened and not alot happened, it strange.but i like it enough too read the next one.
bu kadar keyifli bir mitolojik serüven beklemiyordum açıkçası. keşke daha uzun olsaydı dedim."Güzelliği, doğruluğu ve cesareti aramalısın. Sadece bir tanesi asla yetmez. Üçüncüsü olmadan ilk ikisi yeterli olmaz. Bilmen gerekeni kendi içinde ara ve öğren. Karanlığın en çok sakladığı şeyi bul. Işığın gölgeleri, aşkın acıyı yenilgiye uğrattığı yerlerde ara onu. Onun orada söylediği şarkıdan gümüş gözyaşları akıyor, çünkü o şarkı ruhtan kaynaklanmakta. İleriye ve arkaya bak, güzelliğin nerede yeşerdiğini ve tanrıçanın nerede şarkı söylediğini gör. Orada korku ve keder olabilir, ama doğru bir yürek ikisini de yener. Aradığını bulduğun zaman, aşk büyüyü bozacak ve yürek anahtarı yaratıp ışığa çıkaracaktır."
Weird .
I don't even know why I don't like this book Nice characters : Check Good plot :  Check  Adorable dogs that are way better than the characters :  CheckSo , you see my problem with this book .
I can't figure out why this book didn't come out so well .
It was probably my expectations .
Or it was probably the absurdity of how Malory ends up in this .
I enjoyed this book on an overall and the other two books were also okay , I guess .
But was it worth the hype ?
Nah .
What's not to love when Nora Roberts steps into the world of celtic magic?
Even though I know what's going to happen in every story written by Nora Roberts, I love reading her.
I love a good story with a happy ending, and this one gives you all that, plus I found myself chuckling out loud.
I love it when a author engages my emotions enough to make me scared, laugh, cry, get angry, etc.
Nora Roberts is an excellent writer, and she can do all that.
There are too many writer's and/or publishers out there, who are lazy or just don't care enough about the reader to do a good job of proof reading and editing.
Kasabanın ürkütücü bir üne sahip olan Warrior's Peak kalesinde sanat galerisine ve doğrudan kendisine faydalı olacak parçalar satın alma amacı vardır.
Kütüphane görevlisi Dana ve kıskanç patronu yüzünden işten ayrılan bekar bir anne Zoe.Ev sahipleri olan Rowena ve Pitte onlara inanılması zor bir hikayeyi anlatırlar.
Başlarda öylesine konuya dahil olsalarda sonralarda başlarına gelen şeyler ile hiç tanışmadıkları bu üç ruhu özgür bırakmak için ellerinden geleni yaparlar.Olayların geçtiği kasabanın betimlemesi gerçekçiydi.
Konuya bakınca anahtar gizeminin çok fazla ön planda olmasını beklemiştim ama olay daha farklı bir açıyla ele alınmış.
Aşk yok sanmayın...Dana'nın üvey ağabeyi Flynn ve Malory çiftini okumak gerçekten çok eğlenceliydi.
Malory and the two women who fast become her friends doesn't really believe in the fantasy story, but for a fortune they're ready to accept the challenge.
But some people will make them believe that there's something else behind the concrete and tangible and soon, Malory, Dana and Zoe are not the only one who'll find themselves mingled in this story.
And I think that if you're too practical and too plausibility oriented, there's a chance you won't like this book because you have to believe that the three women accepted the assignment after hearing a crazy story and didn't even believe in it or that Malory and Flynn felt in love in less than a week.
Faltaram mais aspetos e pormenores acerca do mistério e da lenda que envolve as três chaves, faltaram mais momentos que aprofundassem as relações entre as personagens e a forma como o mistério foi resolvido por Malory foi apressado e com um conteúdo pouco esmiuçado.
Penso que o Flynn merecia um pouco mais de destaque para conseguirmos compreender de um forma mais profunda a sua personalidade e a sua forma de agir perante os outros.Eu sei que este é o primeiro livro de uma trilogia e que, por isso, é importante deixar algumas pontas soltas do mistério para que sejam desenvolvidas nos livros seguintes.
When perfect strangers Malory, Zoe, and Dana all receive a mysterious summons to the local historical mansion Warrior's Peak, none of them quite know what to expect.
Age old secrets, legends, and destinies bind them together on a quest to rid the world of an ancient evil and set right a wrong that began long long ago.
As long as the women are up to the task.I think this is absolutely my FAVORITE Nora Roberts book I have read so far!
And as much as I loved the story, I really was head over heels for the characters, especially Dana.
I am really excited about the next book in the trilogy!
I read this book and the two others in the series over the course of a very long weekend when I hosted a garage sale, and I mostly enjoyed it because the women were sassy, the story was fun, and it didn't make me think too hard.I don't like it when people say that they're above certain types of writing.
You have feelings about the characters and I think that's the sign of any good writer - if they can make you give a damn.So I liked these books, and I continue to read Nora Roberts novels (of which there are many) when they come across my path.

The first of the Key trilogy. Set in a fictitious Pennsylvania town, three women search to free the imprisoned souls of three demi-goddesses while trying to avoid malicious vengeful Celtic gods.Perhaps this should really get a fourth star. I loved the characters. If you disregard the gods run amok aspect, this is a great romance. The dialog had me smiling through most of the book. Fun.
I finished this book for 3 days. Malory Price was such a professional and straight-to-the-point lady. But she has a wild side, and seductive. LMAO. I appreciate this kind of novel because of the mystery. The power relies on their abilities. :) love it.
Great Feel Good BookI LOVE escaping into Nora's world. Where everyone has a quick whit and amazing sex. Who needs more then that?
Was a bit disappointed by this one. The theme of the story is one that usually catches me without trouble but this story fell kind of flat. I couldnt connect to any of the characters and didnt feel for them in any way - it felt more like a dull enragement of things happening without emotions. I will probably read the other two books one day but Im in no hurry.

4 Stars... If I could use one word to describe this book it would be "Charming"... From the characters to the setting and storyline, it all was captivating and enchanting... The romance was a nice mix of sweet and sexy with the added element of humor to lighten it and keep it relatable... I enjoyed this introduction into this fascinating story and look forward to continuing the series.:)
I don't know how I missed this Nora Roberts trilogy, but I did! Loved it. I'm a sucker for romance and Irish mythology! :)
Gosto sempre dos livros de Nora Roberts. Este tem romance, humor e um pouco de misticismo. Muito giro
And let us not forget that she made some new friendships with Dana and Zoe: her cohorts with this adventure.Lastly, there was Flynn and Moe: an attractive man -Dana's stepbrother- and his mutant-size dog.
When the story's pacing felt erratic at times, Moe gave me reason to regroup and continue reading.
Of course, Moe gave it some light humorous moments.
At times, Malory came across a little too sharp with Flynn and then she was confused.
*And you may want to put little weight on my review because the majority of 30,000+ people thought this story was wonderful.*Now it is Dana's turn to find a key.
ilk olarak söylemeliyim ki eğer hala seriyle tanışmadıysanız çok şey kaybediyorsunuz...Konuyu şöyle 
It is much more than that.The novel (the first of three in the Key Trilogy) includes a mythic background with three goddesses who are trapped asleep in a glass box and three women are brought together--whom happen to look exactly like the goddesses--to find the three keys to open the glass box while trying to beat Kane--the evil sorcerer who trapped the daughters in the glass box.The story is has the bond of friendships, relationships which are mended or created, and a realization of what Malory--one of the three woman and who the POV of the book is around--really wants with her life.
Despite the info dump in the early chapters and a bit of a slow section in the first half, I really enjoyed this book.
They strike a deal to each find three hidden keys.
One by one, they'll each take a turn to find their key.
I really enjoyed the relationship between the women.
I think Malory's relationship with Flynn moved way too fast, certainly too fast for true love, but I just went with it because it was enjoyable.
Flynn was also a lot of fun, but Moe - the dog - took the spotlight.
I also enjoyed Flynn's relationship with his step-sister and how honest they are with each other.
Güzel kitapları sonradan okumak gibisi yok bence.
Nora ablanın hastasıyız zaten.
Ee kitapta güzeldi o yüzden.
Aşağıdaki küçük bölümde en çok hoşuma giden yerlerden biri.
okudukça gülesim geliyor.
Malory💜****“Bu konuda bana çıkışmanın hiçbir anlamı yok.
Ben zaten kendimi yeteri kadar suçladım.
Ama bunun yararı olmadı elbette.
Ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum.”Dana masanın üstüne oturup ağabeyine doğru eğildi.
“Ne yapmak istiyorsun?”“Bilmiyorum.
Bana çiçek gönderdi.”“Anlamadım.”“Bu sabah bana bir düzine kırmızı gül gönderdi.
Çiçeklere iliştirilmiş olan kartta, “Beni düşün,” yazıyordu.
Onu düşünmemem mümkün mü?”“Güller ha?” Bu fikir Dana’yı eğlendirmişti.
Tuhaf bir durum.
Bu doğru bir şey değil.
Doğal değil.
Bir şekilde yapmalıyım bunu.
Bana bakıp sırıtmayı kes.”
A light and entertaining read, this first book of Nora Roberts' Key trilogy features the usual kind of set-up - three books, three women, three lovestories, one ultimate goal (in this case a magical quest for keys to free the trapped souls of three demigoddesses).
It never ceases to astonish me that Nora Roberts can take the same ingredients over and over again, mix them up a bit and end up with yet another book that will keep you hooked from start to finish even though you know perfectly well how it's gonna end.
Somehow, that always makes these quite relaxing to read.
http://www.writingis.fun/book-review-...I recommend this book to the ones that love some mistery, action and a lot of passion mixed together.I will try to find the books in the book stores, read them and post a review later. The book was amazing and I loved every second of it. To all of the fans of Nora Roberts I want to say that you must read this trilogy, it’s realy breath taking.The book is all about magic in a world that noone believes in that anymore. And in order to find the key the three women must believe in it.
This was the first Nora Roberts book I ever read about 15 years ago. It was so great reading it again, I still love it! I love the inclusion of Celtic mythology, it's so fascinating! Malory is such an interesting character and Flynn is a great love interest. Dana is my absolute favorite character and I can't wait to continue on with her book, Key of Knowledge!
This was my first Nora Roberts book. It was OK. I like the idea and supernatural aspect to the storyline, but in the end, the book was just OK. I went on to read the rest of the series, 'cos I HAD to know how it all finished, but I won't be bothering with any more Nora Roberts...
