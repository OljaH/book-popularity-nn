Number of volumes: 33Number of chapters: 360Status: on-going/currently on damn hiatus.Rating of the whole manga: all the stars in the world. ∞The anime is actually my favorite. After watching it about 3 times (twice 1999 and once 2011, however, I watched some episodes of the latter multiple times), I decided to read the manga. Hunter x Hunter is my favorite thing in the world. Hunter x Hunter tells the adventures of four young friends: Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio.  Minor spoilers of the fir
He also meets Leorio who wants to become a Doctor but unfortunately, needs money, so the Hunter exam seemed like a great opportunity to help him achieving his goal.
Gon undergoes an amazing transformation, like most shonen main characters, he isn't the brightest but that doesn't stop him from stealing your heart.
So basically Hunter x Hunter is not only my favorite thing in the world but also features my most loved character ever.
He gets turned on by strong people yet I can't help but see him as a good guy, after all, because of him, Gon will be stronger.

I said I'm gonna write a long review no matter what and even though nobody writes long reviews for m
Gon is the young Son Goku-looking protagonist of the book, and he has some extraordinary instincts that make it clear that he’s going to become a hunter in the future.
The book has a fairly standard shonen setup, and judging by the first volume not much about it stands out so far.
Based on all the praise I hear about this series, I have no doubt that it only gets better as the story progresses, so I am looking forward to more volumes of HxH in the future.
If you so choose to read this manga, read it well past the first couple of volumes and don't give up.
Because the first volumes make the entire series as a whole seem bland and childish, but as the manga progresses you will be richly rewarded.Besides the slow start.
Hunter x Hunter is simply amazing.
And may I add when you are at chapter 62 that you SHOULD watch episode 36 of the 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime.
That episode is one of the unique anime moments where you wet your pants from laughing and the anime character wets his pants because of different reasons.....
4.5 starsThis is a masterpiece . This series has one of the best story arcs ever . It's characters are so layered unlike most of the shonen mangas . Moreover the Chimaera Ant Arc had made it on of my favorite graphic novels .
Este manga lo encontré por primera vez como una serie de anime que capte por pura casualidad en la tele un fin de semana que no tenía nada que hacer y bueno, quede enamorado al instante es para mí uno de los mejores mangas que existen a la fecha.Muy recomendado.
As a Japanese manga and by Yoshihiro Togashi I can say without any doubt : " It is magnificent " ...It is all about deciding to go towards an aim ..
Our positive energy , thinking and the strong stamina is the most vital of them to take us there ...
The world is full of troubles and the hunter is the one who aims at overcoming them ..
A moment of thinking is enough to make us far away from painful years of regret .
I would say, even better than Yu Yu Hakusho, though I love that one to pieces.
All the characters, all the trademark jokes, all the personalities.
One thing this mangaka should be famous for is the creation of multi-faceted characters who are just hilarious both when they're killing you and when they're digging a hole to sleep in for three days.
The cast of characters alone will have you fits of laughter.
My favorite characters are, oddly, Leorio and Kurapica.
Usually I go for the NEED REDEMPTION kids like Killua, but I'm all about the doctor and madcrazy red-eyed one.
How is it possible for characters to grow on me this much after just one volume? (Leorio!!! best boy) Such interesting, unique personalities, great character design, especially Hisoka. Speaking of which, now I kinda understand why everyone’s so obsessed with him. So far, he’s my favorite. ♥🃏♠The plot kinda reminds me of My Hero Academia but with far less noble intentions on the characters’ part, which makes it all the more real.

By the way, i was watching 2011 anime alongside the manga and the adaptation is REALLY good, so I think I’ll stick to it for now and then pick up the manga at chapter 340.
In HxH the villains are some of the best part, they are well thought out and entertaining to watch.The story isn't groundbreaking, but done it's brilliantly.
However, like most ongoing manga, there are various story arcs.
We see Gon mature and encounter various trials as he develops as a hunter and helps his friends.The art is on and off.
Other times, there are issues when it's clear the art isn't quite as strong.
I've read the manga multiple times and watched more than one version of the anime.
I've probably spent more time with Gon and Killua than I have with any other manga/anime characters.
The exam is an arduous one, where it is said that only one in hundreds of thousands can pass the test (personally, I think this is an exaggeration especially when one sees the amount of Hunters they meet in later volumes).
Backgrounds for the other characters are revealed during the run: Killua comes from an assassin family and is rebelling by taking the Hunter Exam, Kurapika wants to be a Hunter to hunt down a bandit group [Genei Ryodan] who killed his tribe for their scarlet eyes and get access to places (rich collectors, black market, etc) where he can find their eyes, and Leorio wants the riches being a Hunter can provide to become a doctor for the poor.During the test, examinee Hisoka (disqualified from last years examination since he killed a judge) decides to help with the selection process by getting rid of the weaker competition.
Hunters are specially trained workers who's fields range from gourmet hunters to assassins. All Hunters must take the deadly and excruciating Hunter Exam, planned out by determined task makers, to receive their Hunters license. Gon is a nature loving boy who wants to become a Hunter to gain access to all restricted areas to search for his missing father. The story is narrated to make Gon’s test the main story storyline. When Gon leaves to finally take the exam, he teams up with two other exam t
I found this book amazingly fun to read and I often found myself laughing at the jokes hidden in the text.
The only weakness of these books is that you would have to truly love manga to know how to read this book, since it is Japanese format.
I would definitely recommend this book to a classmate or two, but only the ones who I know wouldn’t make fun of manga later.
I plan to revisit the library again to finish up over 30 other books to this series.
To Ms.Gaston: The books I read were a books 1 through 3, so this review is for the 3 volumes together.
Actual rating: 4.5 starsYES.
I finally started to read the manga.
I'm a HUGE fan of the anime, and this is amazing!!!!!!
Why 4.5 stars, you might ask.
Well, the art.
Because of how BEAUTIFUL the anime was,I guess I was just expecting...more.
But if nothing I say will make you read this, just do it for Killua.
Then once you see his amazingness, read this.
Or even better, watch the anime.
Oh, but it gets dark.
REALLY dark.
I was reading over this, and I noticed QUITE a few typos.
Pueden haber comics mejores en historia, personajes, dibujos pero Hunter x Hunter es de los primeros que me hicieron querer tanto el anime/manga y todo lo que refiere a Japón.
Por eso le doy 4 estrellas.
El arco de los exámenes de cazador es considerado uno de los más infatiles pero a mi me divierte mucho y me pone nostálgica.
Por eso es que se merece la nota que le pongo, me hizo muy feliz leerlo.
Gon es el típico personaje de shounen, pero estoy extremadamente encariñada con el personaje.
"Gonzalo" como le decía mi mamá cuando por las tardes veíamos el anime de 1999 juntas.
He seems really young o.O (hide spoiler)]Chapter 02(view spoiler)[Was the storm an unofficial test for wannabe hunters?
(hide spoiler)]Chapter 05(view spoiler)[So we have 404 participants, and one of them appears to be roughly the same age as Gon - neat!
He seems like such a good character too, so I’m hoping for more of him c: I really love the fact that he has a skateboard which he started using when everyone else was running :P (hide spoiler)]Chapter 06(view spoiler)[Running… more than 60 km…?
(hide spoiler)]Chapter 07 (view spoiler)[MORE THAN 80?
I know this manga, but I have never read in manga because I only watch anime on tv. However my friend recommended me that you must read this manga. I began to read manga. I have already known the content of this manga. I found it interesting for me to read this manga. This story is about hunters. In this world, it is situated high position of job. This main character is also tried to be a hunter. I am looking forward to reading next volume as soon as possible.
God, I love this series so much. Hunter X Hunter is probably my favorite series ever. I am re-reading this series (again) and I can’t be more happy. This whole series is amazing. I can’t recommend it enough.
This was a great first volume. I’m so glad that I finally started this series.

Un manga fantasy passionnant qui donne vraiment envie de voir Gon devenir un Hunter ! 😍
This is a first book of hunter x hunter. There are unique characters even first volume. My best character is Hisoka. Actually, he is an antagonist but, this author make the character very cool even he is villain.
Off the bat, characters are super likable and it's been fun to see them put into novel scenarios. Looking forward to reading more. I missed Togashi.
I have already read this manga as a Japanese version. When I read this manga at first time, I thought this is complicated and dislike the picture.However, This story is great! At the beginning of this manga, main character, Gon will be Hunter in spite of difficulties. Gon is very funny and he is bright person. Kurapika is cool and genius. Reorio is stupid. Like this everyone has different personalities. So I like seeing this three person. I'll continue to read it!
Because this way of threading characters into the story is relative, Togashi can import themes tied to certain characters with great immediacy and power as he likes, and the effortless darker turn it takes after the protagonists prevail in the Hunter exams is testament to this feature.A new anime adaptation is currently airing and is as vibrant and faithful as can be expected (it's the anime which turned me to the series in the first place).
قد لمعت عيناه بالعزم انتفضت يُمناه في هدوء الليل الانمي الأفضل الذي تابعتهُ في سنة ٢٠٠٤ ومازلتُ أتابعه لأسباب كثيرة أولها ابتكار في رسوم الشخصيات ابتكار القصة ابتكار لغة خاصة بها يُدخلك توغاشي الى عالم Hunter x Hunter الذي لا رجعة منه المانغا افضل بكثير من المسلسل والفلم فهو يجعلك تتكلم بكل الحالات وحتى أصوات الأقدام عندما يسيرونتجربتي الاولى في قراءة ألمانغا أحببتها كثيراً وتستحق النجمات الخمس
Probably the best manga of all time. Don't believe me? Read it for yourself.
This manga was exciting for me. Because reading this manga, I can understand and feel it that to get hunter license is too difficult for characters and us. But Gon, Killua, Curapika and Leorio overcome difficulties to get hunter license.I was excited by this part.
I'm talking about the one that's one of the greatest, and most violent, anime/manga I've read/seen so far.What is Hunter X Hunter, you ask?It's a Japanese manga that was adapted into two anime series.
This broke the slump.I rated it 3.5 stars the first time, but that was because I judged it based on book 1.It may seem childishly boring at first, but, as the story progresses, HxH turns into a darkly violent tale full of amazing ideas and excellent character growth.Seriously, it's really underrated.
Read it.5 Stars.
Mulai membaca ulang kembali komik Hunter x Hunter karena mulai beli lagi komiknya. Selalu suka dengan kisah awal perjuangan Gon, Killua, Kurapika, dan Leorio untuk menjadi seoarang Hunter.
