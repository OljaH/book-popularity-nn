“If you want to be happy, be.”(Leon Tolstoi)
One can never go wrong with Tolstoy.
With various individual versions ranging from around 50 pages to just over 100 pages, it should be thought of more as a novella rather than a short story.
In fact, it is broken down into short chapters, which means that even if you didn't have time to read it in one sitting, finding a natural break is quite easy.The descriptions of a small rural village are well drawn.
The time of the story is winter, a cold you will be able to feel even if you've always lived in warm climes.
The story is too short for more.
There is a moral to the story which is easily understood.
