Many things were a turn off for me in this legal thriller, like Andy Barber's propensity to hint at future developments as he narrates the past.
To wit: "I think about that now, how I should have seen Laurie then, should have paid more attention...I was a fool...I know that now." These multiple vague references combined with mysterious transcripts from another trial frustrated me.
Then at the end, there's a "twist," followed by an abrupt ending where we have to guess what happens.
And the story itself didn't pull me in as much as I thought it would.
By the end, my adrenaline levels were so high I needed to borrow my Mom’s blood pressure pills.If you don’t want spoilers, you should probably stop reading now because I can only avoid them for so long.
The assistant DA’s teenage son is implicated in the murder of his classmate and so even though this is at some level a legal drama, it is also a family drama.
This seemingly unrelated testimony adds to the suspense of the book and its relevance is not revealed until the final chapter.
And if you want to know what that relevance is, it turns out to be this: (view spoiler)[
It has been YEARS since a book has had a twist that I didn't see coming. Well played William Landay, I would never have imagined the ending of this book. I will definitely have a "book hangover" from this one. I can't start a new book because I can't get this one out of my head!
If you can get past a few contrived plot points (this is where readers will divide), and engage with the narrator, whose reliability or unreliability is a puzzle to piece together, you will be satisfied with this warm yet dark story of a community and family unhinged by a violent crime.
The narrative is even, polished, and intelligently observant of a community in shock, a family shattered.I have relatives in Newton, Massachusetts, where this thriller takes place.
Violence is rare.Jacob, the fourteen-year-old son of First District Attorney Andy Barber, is accused of murdering his classmate, Ben Rifkin.
I'm annoyed. As I said in one of my updates, this is an odd book, a psychological thriller with little understanding of psychology. It's written in the first person from the father's point of view. He was very annoying with his stubborn blocking of the truth from himself to his unemotional narration. If the author meant to convey a kind of underlying emotional tension, he failed miserably. The ending felt like a cheap shot, and I feel cheated.
In fact, when I first heard about this book I couldn't help but think of the movie Before and After starring Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, where their teen son Jacob (yep, he's Jacob too) is accused of murdering his girlfriend and it tears the family apart.
Defending Jacob does a great job at looking at issues of guilt, innocence and culpability.
For anyone who isn't sick of arguing the nature/nurture debate, Defending Jacob raises some interesting questions concerning the existence of a "murder gene" and whether violence can be passed down through the generations like eye color.
Defending Jacob is told in the first person by Andy Barber, an experienced assistant district attorney in suburban Massachusetts.
Andy Barber hires an actual defense attorney to defend Jacob (though he acts as second chair).
Despite a rather forgettable dramatis personae, Landay does a good job detailing the toll that Jacob’s legal predicament – both the buildup and the trial itself – has on the Barber family.
In this book, due to its parallel storylines (Jacob’s trial and the grand jury of Andy), you get two twists for the price of one.
This is every parent’s worst nightmare and Andy and Laurie will do anything to defend their child but while doing so learn that Jacob has his secrets.This is exactly the sort of Novel I normally stay away from as as having a teenager I sometimes scare away from books like this as feel they make me overthink and thats not a good thing in some cases but this was a group read and therefore I joined in and I loved the book.
Second time around the book was just as good as its been a few years since I read it and happy to say still a 5 star read for me.
I have had Defending Jacob on my TBR list for awhile and have been waiting for the right time to read it.
I love when that happens.I found Defending Jacob to be an original, gripping, complex, and an interesting crime thriller as well as emotional and a thought provoking family drama.
Defending Jacob had me asking myself so many questions and I was stunned at the same time.
I highly recommend for crime thrillers who like some family drama and for parents who love to be challenged with parenting questions.http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi...
This book went through my newsfeed once, a really long time ago, and ever since then I have been wanting to read it.
This book did not disappoint!What the book was about:The book is told from the father's point of view, Andy Barber.
Jacob was accused of the murder and his father believes he was innocent.This book covered all aspects of the Jacob being possibly convicted: evidences, doubts, best friends going against you and so much more.
This book kept me on my toes till the very end!
There were tons of twists, new information, etc.
I highly suggest this to anyone that likes mysteries and/or books with twists.
The spoon-fed trial details, the slipping between the present and the past almost effortlessly, the family history that comes out later like a pissed off reptile, and the emotional struggle to hold a family together even as it’s being torn apart all make for one glorious read.
And yet he takes nearly 431 pages to answer one basic question: Is Jacob guilty or not?
He doesn’t want to believe he could have made an error raising his son; instead, he chooses to focus on the goodness and righteousness that he sees every day in Jacob.
5 brilliant and heartbreaking stars :-(This story isn't about proving Jacob is innocent or guilty.
For me this story was about fathers unconditional love for his son, no matter the outcome.
Has a wife who is a teacher and a 14 year old son, Jacob.
Every time a "dark" thought (doubt) sneaks up on him, he tries to push it away with a memory from Jacob's childhood.
The amazing thing about this story, and what made this book so hard to put it down was little cliffhangers or hints left here and there.
But then, Andy is stunned when his own son becomes the principal suspect in the killing after classmates reveal that Jacob had a knife much like the one the police have described as the missing murder weapon.Andy insists, of course, that Jacob is innocent.
Inevitably, all of this takes a toll on Andy and Laura's marriage, and so this is also a portrait of a family in crisis.I had fairly mixed emotions about this book.
But once the police come searching and cannot find the knife, the immediate and logical assumption is that Andy got rid of it knowing or suspecting that Jacob was the killer.
The story revolves around solving the murder of fourteen year old Ben Rifkin who was stabbed three times and left dead in a local park.
I flip-flopped countless times on my feelings toward the fourteen year old defendant, Jacob.
I was questioning myself throughout the novel as to how I would have reacted as a parent.My reason for taking away one star was that at times I felt the story dragged a little.
I was completely captivated by the story initially, but found throughout the book there were times where I wasn't as interested and my mind wandered a tiny bit.
Personally, this tale of the fourteen year old son of an Assistant D.A. accused of murdering a classmate put me more in mind of the William March book THE BAD SEED.Several of Landay's characters lack flesh on their bones and the actions of some are downright unbelievable.
The Jacob character must be based upon the Sphinx (he is that inscrutable) or perhaps he takes after his father Andy, who has managed to keep a secret from his wife for fourteen years.
***5 " Unwavering " Stars**  Have you ever tried to write a review but no matter how hard you tried , you just couldn't articulate your thoughts properly ?
. which will tell you nothing about the book itself, is the best I could come up with :-( Thankfully, there are numerous fantastic reviews on GR.
The array of emotions I felt while reading this story ranged from .

There's a stanza from a Wendell Berry poem called "The Way of Pain" that applies to both of the fathers in this story -- the one whose son was murdered, and the one whose son was accused of murder.
"And then I slept, and dreamedthe life of my only sonwas required of me, and Imust bring him to the edgeof pain, not knowing why.I woke, and yet that painwas true.
It brought his lifeto the full in me.
I bore himsuffering, with love like the sun,too bright, unsparing, whole."That fierce love, that intensity and vulnerability called parenthood, is the essence of this family and courtroom drama.
Normally, when a book screams at me, I'm going to be a movie, someday! I let it go.

(hide spoiler)].I would no sooner have shown up on Tuesday AM to face this band of retired teachers and librarians without having read the book, than I would have smoked pot before taking the SAT's.
The first-person narrator is a seasoned district attorney who finds himself on the other side when his son is accused of murdering a classmate.
It was like a two-hour season finale of a TV crime show, with a lot of extraneous padding to allow for more commercials.
Wowza! A gripping courtroom thriller that examines the lengths one husband and father will go to protect his family. Make no mistake the pace of the story is slow and the legal process is stretched out in an effort to keep us dangling for over 400 pages to reach a jaw dropping ending. "Defending Jacob" might have been written in 2012, but it has made its way to the top of my favorites list for 2017.
It kept me in suspense, turning the pages till late at night.Andy Barbour is the Assistant District Attorney.He is called to a crime scene where Ben Rifkin, a 14 year old boy has been stabbed in a park.
The police think they have a suspect, a pedophile who lives nearby and is known to go to the park often.Then Andy's son Jacob, one of Bens classmates becomes a suspect.
They think that this gives Jacob a motive to murder Ben. A lot of Jacob's classmates post messages on facebook suggesting he is guilty of the crime.
Defending Jacob by William Landay is the most exciting unputdownable legal thriller i have read this year really enjoyed the storyline & the plot outstanding i finished it last night & i must say what a compelling ending i didn't see coming.Andy Barbers job is to put killers behind bars but in a small town just outside of Boston where he lives is the kind of place parents go to bring up their children safely& violent crime is a rarity.A boy from his son Jacob's school is found dead stabbed to death in the park the whole town reels in shock Andy comes under intense pressure to find the murderer & prosecute the perp.At first the investigation is going nowhere until a crucial piece of evidence turns up linking Jacob to the murder which Andy & Laurie Jacob's mother does not believe .
Set in a small town in Massachusetts, Defending Jacob tells the story of fourteen-year-old Jacob Barber, the son of a well-respected Assistant District Attorney, who is accused of murdering a boy in his year at school.
The reader is kept guessing as to whether Jacob is innocent or guilty until the very end of the novel.
(hide spoiler)]The story is told from Jacob's father, Andy's, point of view and he is completely convinced of his son's innocence, even when the evidence points towards his son.
(view spoiler)[ I feel Andy was really aware of his son's "problems" even though he claimed not to be.
A few curve balls thrown toward the end (view spoiler)[ like the grandfather, while in prison, arranging a fixer to "fix" Jacob's quickly-tanking court case; or the Joren van der Sloot-y Jamaican family holiday; or Jacob's mom's showing her love by crashing into a bridge embankment (hide spoiler)] seemed painfully contrived, rather than shocking like Landay obviously intended.I apologize to my friends (and there are many) who gave  Defending Jacob 4 or 5 stars, but I just could not feel the love for this.
For most of the book I fell for the trap and thought that Jacob would be wrongfully convicted and the real murderer, Patz, would walk free.
There is one glaring difference here though: Laurie never stopped loving Jacob.
She loved him too much to let him be a murderer and hurt other people, and she loved him too much to watch him go through a trial again and possibly end up in jail.
You can talk about whether she was right or wrong, but she was driven by nothing but her blinding love for her child.
This legal thriller was more taut and riveting than any I have read in years. Arriving late to the party in reading this book, I am fortunate to have remained unaware of the ending, which was killer! The scene played out in the supermarket checkout line was sheer perfection - "quivering with hatred like a tuning fork". I could almost feel it, I swear. Excellent work, I recommend it without reservation.
They reveal the hold that blood can have on one's choices and future.In a voice that is at once determined and devastated, Andy recounts the details of the build up towards his son's trial and the monumental changes every relationship he has undergoes as a result of the charge.
She asks the unthinkable questions, thereby providing the foil to Andy's unquestioning devotion.The gritty discourse moves the story along briskly through plot twists and turns that seem like they've been lifted from today's reality television.
Could you picture your kid as a murderer, even if he or she were one?
What if you were the parent of the kid that was murdered?
How do you feel about the person who murdered your kid?
How far would you go to be sure the monster who murdered your kid suffers in the worst possible way?
How much does being bullied day in & day out affect a kid?
How much punishment is the bully deserving of?Lots of thinking to do with this book.
I hold books featuring cops and lawyers to a higher standard.
Working with flashback 1st person narration and some firecracker grand jury testimony for a case that isn't revealed until the end, the building blocks of the book and its story are great.The main character, Andy Barber, disturbed by his own family history and the possible homicidal tendencies of his son, however, never really comes alive.
I just felt disappointed that this could have been a really impressive book with a great story and killer ending but instead I was so frustrated with its shortcomings.

I reading list doesn't usually include a heavy diet of courtroom murder thrillers-(and family drama) ---but I'm not sure why not--I enjoyed this book!
I was never clear who 'really' had the upper hand (who was ahead during the days of the trial), --and how the Grand Jury was evaluating the murder case.
It was not until the novel was finished when I continued to spend 'more' time evaluating the testimony.
(I'd enjoy reading more books like this).I'd say more: but I don't want to spoil anything.
Note: I haven't read any of the other reviews on this book yet!
