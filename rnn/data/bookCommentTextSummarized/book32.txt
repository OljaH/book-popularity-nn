It is not a book, it is a way of being.
Sri Aurobindo has a clear and concise way of speaking about the role of surrender contrasted with grace. This short text was a beautiful read and something I like to keep in my back pocket.
An important volume for those who wish to learn of the Divine Mother and her workings - on how to be an instrument of the Divine Consciousness through aspiration, rejection and surrender, to become a 'true doer of divine works' and put oneself in contact with the supreme Grace.
This is a wonderful little book... a profound exposition on Shakti, her various roles and the forms she takes in this world to protect us and lead us to ever greater levels of consciousness.
Wonderful!
Pretty wonderful book about Auroville's other founder, The Mother...a beautiful woman.
"So Little book, So Much Inspiration"
There is many levels to this piece and multiple reading gives me different levels of understanding.
