However, by the time we get to book three and Tally’s brain has been reset AGAIN, it’s becoming frustrating and it doesn’t help that in this final book Westerfeld doesn’t take the time to explore what’s really going on with her.
Add to that Shay’s many reversals—I kept expecting it to be revealed that she’s totally PSYCHOTIC, but apparently not—Zane’s quick dismissal, and the almost complete absence of David (after he was also barely in the last book) and you can’t help being disappointed with the conclusion to these characters’ stories, because they barely seem like the characters you started out with and that Westerfeld made you care about.
So I didn't like Tally as much in this book.
Part of the plot line is that she is supposed to overcome this, but I didn't feel she completely did.Other things that marred my enjoyment of this story...I hated the cutting aspect.
Am I wrong to feel a responsible writer of books for teenage girls would include a discussion of how harmful cutting can be?This book is also accepting of behaviors I don't think are acceptable like underage drinking, and in the previous books, starving oneself and cohabitation at the age of sixteen.
Like I mentioned, at the beginning, it was surprisingly difficult to care about with the main character — the problem, I guess, with the mind-altering surgeries performed between each of these novels is that the first chunk of each book is, like, from a totally new character’s point of view.It did pick up after awhile, but I still didn’t care for the ending — none of the questions I’d had from Pretties had been resolved, and the book seemed to end with a whimper, not a bang.
One thing I've noticed about Westerfeld's novels is how bittersweet the endings are.
Westerfeld knows life will never have a happy ending, just a bittersweet one.Specials is no exception.
Although the novel starts off slow, it quickly builds up speed, carrying you along Tally's final journey.
She's now a Cutter, a Special Circumstances pet project.
Cutters are stronger -and more obnoxious- than anyone, built to bring an end to the New Smoke.
Despite her new rank, though, Tally still feels amiss, and is determined to make Zane a cutter too.
One of things I really enjoyed is how different Tally becomes in each book.
I held on this long in hope that somehow you would bring me around and show me how to like Tally, but it kind of went the opposite direction, you know?
The fourth book, though an afterthought, is where you could have rectified yourself, but instead you came up with a whole new story like a lame, sure-to-fail spinoff show, with special guest appearances from the former cast who are contractually obliged to lend their star power to improve ratings.
Is this written at a bubbly pretty reading level and I'm just over thinking it?
What happened?
It wasn't the greatest series I'd ever read but c'mon!
Did they give him time?
It was worse the the third movie sequel that shouldn't have had a second.
Where do I begin with this train wreck?
There wasn't one storyline that was wrapped up.
The plot was thrown together so hastily and it left more holes (and was as deep as) an 80's John Hughes film.
I think it was supposed to leave the reader hopeful but it was just stupid and wrong on all levels and did not make sense to the purpose of the entire series!
It's fatally flawed in my opinion, both in tone and content.
But, as an example of literature, it falls flat and since my interest in YA lit is exclusively how it might be used in the classroom or whether I can suggest the book for outside reading, I have to say, it's a problem.
None of this would keep me from wanting to use the book in a classroom, however.
And they stay "icy" (translated: aware and outside of their programming) by cutting themselves with knives.This particular direction takes the book off the shelves for classroom use and I'm disappointed.
Even better than I remembered. Tally, do you ever suffer from sudden flashes of anger or euphoria, countersocial impulses, or feelings of superiority? Tally Youngblood lives in a society where they're given the "mandatory opportunity" to become pretty once they reach a certain age.Through their surgery they become absolutely drop-dead gorgeous (aka Pretty) but (and this is a big BUT), the doctors will implant a few lesions (i.e. "bubbles") in select regions of their brains.These lesions take awa
"bubbles") in select regions of their brains.These lesions take away much if the stronger emotions and critical thinking skills - thus the cities have a way to control the population.Tally was once a Pretty but through circumstance and skill, she managed to out think the lesions and escape to the ruins (where free-thinking humans have carved out an existence).
And while she is strong, confident and ready to hurt those in her way, she begins to wonder, what if being Special is just another kind of Pretty?
I have only commented on Goodreads on a couple of books I've read, but this one really bothered me.
I also think that even though the "cutters" eventually realized they didn't need to do that, there are many readers out there who will be intrigued enough about the concept to experiment and I find it irresponsible for a book aimed a teenagers to make this horrible (and real even in our day) practice look so enticing and power-granting.
WHAT A FANTASTIC FINALE! WOW!I read Uglies at the beginning of this year and really enjoyed it.. later on I read Pretties and was really disappointed. It took me a while to get around to Specials, but boy am I glad I did because I enjoyed it so much!It had all of the action, emotion, moral dilemma, character development, and great story-telling as the first one! I won't say too much more since I'm planning a review video, but I was so happy with this finale to the trilogy! YAY!
If you are interested in this series, simply use the formula below and insert the suggested words into the blanks for each different book:1.
Tally doesn't like or feels out of place being ____.2.
Tally gets roped into being a mole to uncover _____.3.
Tally betrays _____.4.
Tally gets capture (usually) and gets turned into a _____.(For Uglies, insert ugly, The Smoke, David, and pretty.
For Pretties, insert pretty, The Smoke, David and Zane, and special.
For Specials, insert special, The New Smoke, everyone, and environmentalist.)It's a bit of an oversimplification, but not much.
Uglies was pretty interesting, but it was all downhill from there.
Alright, let's get this over with.******Spoilers ahead******Soooooooo, we catch up with Tally who we know has been carted away back to New Pretty Town after Special Circumstances raids The Smoke - again.
Yeh, I didn't get it either.Anywhooo, poor Zane has some brain damage and wasn't able to become a Special like Tally.
To make another long boring story short, Tally follows Zane in the wild as he makes his way to The Smoke's new location.
Dear Tally brings Special Circumstances to it's knees, everyone gets the cure and all seems to be going peachy for the world.
Ugh. I hate Tally soooo much.Words ruined in this book: Icy and crumbly.Alright I just have one more book to get through.I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.
All the sticky ends are left hanging loose, despite Scott Westerfeld attempts to hide them with convenient plot twists.
None of the issues had been solved, and I have no doubt that 99% of readers will be left unsatisfied once they turn the final page.As I keep saying in my reviews of this trilogy, I find the concept of this world thoroughly interesting so I think it would be wrong of me to rate this anything lower.
Ever.This trilogy (grr) did have its moments and was so incredibly thought-provoking.
I mean, the main idea was to make Zane special, and so he had to prove that he worth being special.
And, to be honest, I like David more than Zane, but that's just me.
I did like, though, the first part of the book, and Tally's jounrey through the wild.
But the ending ruined the rest of the book.
When did Tally started carring for those matters?
Bottom line is, that although the writing was brilliant, and Tally's character well structured and balanced, for all the changes she had to go though, the idea didn't help the book reach it's full potentials.
the series follows our main character thrue several very dramatic transformations that by the end left me wanting more, like a good book should.
like i said these books were written for a younger audience but i think they still paint an interesting setting and are just fun to read.
if your looking for a quick easy read, a book you want to share with a younger person that you will also find interesting, or just ran out of alternate future world books to read, then try it out, i think you'll like it.
On the other hand, I did not support some decisions made by Tally (even though I did understand them).
But, I would like to give my opinion about Tally's decision to (view spoiler)[ stay a special.
She was sick of people messing with her brain for the third time now, but I really believed that she would want to return to her old self and to her old looks.
I didn't get the feeling like it did and that for sure is my main issue with this book.
Me at every YA protagonist ever:"I thought if you could see the world clearly, you'd think about yourself a little less. It wouldn't just be you and your latest boyfriend; I thought you might let something else matter every once in a while." The Writing and Worldbuilding The world really expanded in this one, and even gave me a clearer geographic idea of where the previous books took place. I'm guessing Tally's city is in Oregon or Washington, and that makes me happy because yay! A local!I liked
Sometimes I think I'm nothing but what other people have done to me—a big collection of brainwashing, surgeries, and cures."Overall, I liked this book, but I wasn't really on the edge of my seat the whole time; I wasn't bored either though, as Westerfeld's writing style is very easy and quick, and the action was fast and well-paced.
Any way, I'm glad that Westerfeld wrote Extras and is going to write three more books set in the Uglies world, starting with Imposters, because I really like the world and I'm excited to delve deeper into it, hopefully with less Speshul Tally and more new characters.
COUNT AS TWO BOOKS!
Tally has been transformed into a strong, mean person like the specials she saw when she was an ugly and pretty.Everything is perfect, Shay and Tally are friends, the privileges of being a special type of special (a cutter), and she can have any crazy surgery she wants.When she helps Special Circumstances bring the Smoke down, her life as a pretty and ugly clash with her current life, making her decide if she should follow orders or fight for the places and people that bring back all her memories.
Note: I am considering this book the finale of a trilogy, because Extras was an un-planned addition.
It is finally time for me to deal with Specials, the final book in the trilogy that began with Uglies.
It does not seem like a grand finale to the trilogy, but more like any ordinary book.
The major plot twist came half way through, as oppose to the previously mentioned finale's, when the beginning is book one, middle is book two and the end is book three.
It certainly had the trilogy-epic-finale feel about it.
I found it even more annoying when she (view spoiler)[on more than one occasion, refused the cure to being Special-minded in other words the cure that would enable her to think like herself again.
Even though I didn't quite understand Tally's final speech I liked these lines, "You see freedom has a way of destroying things".
So I think Tally (view spoiler)[is saying she's going to protect the wilds at any cost and make sure the people of her world don't go down the same path as us Rusties (hide spoiler)].
It was fascinating to read from a 'super human' point of view with Tally scaling walls and jumping up trees.
I was hoping that in the end you would see how her choices actually made the world a better place, but I was disappointed in that as well.I wish David and Zane had been more important characters.
Ending up with David was a cop out because she no longer even likes him.
I didn't actually like the end at all.
Tally doesn't seem to overcome her brainwashing at all.
Listened to via Audiobook, series review to come.
Specials is the conclusion of a trilogy; the Uglies series technically extends to a fourth novel, Extras, but the story follows a new girl and not Tally Youngblood, the perspective character of the first three books.
I read the first two books quickly, even with my misgivings, but getting through Specials was a slog, to say the least.What I missed the most was the strong descriptions of the wild and the city as presented in Uglies and Pretties.
I was so busy trying to get through Specials that I couldn't enjoy any of the description, so I can't really say whether or not it was the failing of the author or just that I didn't read carefully enough.
I've been in geek denial lately when it comes to my reading habits but I'll go ahead and say it...I like YA sci-fi!
"The Adoration of Jenna Fox", "Unwind", "The Hunger Games"...all stuff that I've read lately and enjoyed.
Tally proved herself to be unlikeable to me through and through, and I didn't find anything redeeming or gratifying about her in the end.
I know this trilogy took on a lot...Not only was it a futuristic world where all of the parameters had to be defined throughout the story, but then Westerfeld goes and changes it all up.
The book’s ending made me a bit angry, I understand Westerfeld’s style, his endings tend to leave you with a few questions which urge you to read more, but this book being the last of the trilogy I was very disappointed.
So far I am not at all disappointed by any of the books in this trilogy(besides the third book’s ending).
Although it was sort of difficult to fully understand how Tally and her new group of Specials, known as the “Cutters”, see the world, Westerfeld did an amazing job explaining it with the best amount of detail that he could.
****MANY SPOILERS!*****This is one of my favorites out of the whole trilogy!
I found it really hard to make it through without getting teary-eyed when Zane died ecspecially since I could almost feel Tally's pain the way Westerfeld wrote about it and since Zane had had the surgery so Tally wouldn't be disgusted with her anymore.
I found it interesting when Maddy found a cure for being special but Tally once again fought her way out of it.
It was a big shocker to me when the person saving Tally from being de-specialized was Doctor Cable but once it was explained, I understood.
3º livro desta saga. Esperava mais, muito mais. Achei que era mais do mesmo. Inicio parecido com os anteriores, enrola, enrola e o final idênticos aos 2 primeiros. Tenho o 4º para ler mas não fiquei com vontade, quem sabe um dia...
The second and third books are far much better than the first one with more Twists, Turns and Tricks!
Specials was action-packed and a thrilling book to read.
Specials even made me cry, and if you have read it before, then I'm sure you know which part.
The last chapter tied everything together nicely and was the perfect ending to a phenomenal trilogy.Anyone who takes the time to read between the lines of these books will realize that Westerfeld has delivered a very important and meaningful message to, we, the readers, and not just another entertaining story.
I already understood the message, which is why I loved the ending so much, but I believe it is something you should be left to discover and understand on your own.
