what I loved about Philip Mohr's work on this academic treasure was how each chapter furthered a concept introduced or touched on in the previous one.
It gives a sense of growth in knowledge and by the time you arrive to the last chapter you already feels like an economic expert.Even though, the book is far from being the beginning and end of all economics knowledge, it is completely necessary in the understanding of its concepts and a must read for anyone interested in learning about economics and how it works in south Africa for the most part.
The book is well-structured, clear and extremely helpful for anyone interested in the subject, there are very few concepts left out because most of what economics is about is covered.
