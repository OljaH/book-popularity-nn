For the past ten years, the 1995* edition of ANANTOMY AND DRAWING has consistently been one of the most useful references in my art library.Unlike similar texts, such as the highly acclaimed Andrew Loomis books, Victor Perard opts to simply show the reader hundreds of illustrations instead of spending a lot of time describing method and technique.
Only ten or so pages are written in plain text in the entire book, with most of the book simply using labels to denote measurements or body parts when necessary.
Finally, while bones and muscles are a major focus of the book, there isnâ€™t a whole lot of material related to how fat layers over them.
Very useful for any artist wishing to do figure drawing. This book covers anatomy pictorially very thoroughly, however I feel it would have benefited from descriptive passage explaining the workings and what one is viewing.I was a bit unsure on the arm proportions given for males, but I'm sure this is anatomically correct as the author has clearly spent much time studying the subject.There could have perhaps been a bit more on the young and old, but I was pleased that it included these variants.
this book has some of the most awesome line drawings i have ever seen. it is an instructional book for learning how to draw human anatomy. there are several editions and i cannot vouch for the the newer versions, but this older edition is letter-pressed and beautiful.
comprehensive in scope and convenient in size (a tad bigger than a half divided sheet of paper). excellent coloring and practice book but not error-free
10-12 years ago as a kid with little money in my pocket I bought this book.
