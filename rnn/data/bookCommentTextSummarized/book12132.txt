how i can read this book?
I cried when I realized that this was the 1st law book I ever finished. (Well, technically speaking, I am wrong because this is only a teensy-weensy part of the civil code.) Nevertheless, I owe it all to my awesome professor who was the very reason I read the book enthusiastically. Without him as a guide, I doubt I'd ever finish the book.
nice

I recommend this book to the future colleagues of my field, this is a well-written book used by many accountancy and law students, pair this up with a well-educated instructor and you'll be able to get the best out of this book.Note: Use this book with other resources related the field for a deeper study of the subject.
