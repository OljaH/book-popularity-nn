Dear book:This is my favorite Linda Howard so far <3I enjoyed every second of it, laughed like crazy at half the book and swooned over Sam the other half of it :D“Let me go,” she said, more nervous than she cared to reveal.“No.”“No!” she repeated.
She was still accomplishing exactly nothing.“You can’t change your mind!” He sounded desperate now.“Yes, I can.”“Do you have herpes?”“No.”“Syphilis?”“No.”“Gonorrhea?”“No.”“AIDS?”“No!”“Then you can’t change your mind.”“What I have is a ripe egg.” That was probably a lie.
(hide spoiler)]That's basically the only thing I didn't like in this book but I looked past it because everything else was perfect :)
"If you're looking for Mr. Perfect, you're going to spend your whole life being disappointed, because he doesn't exist."  I generally hate books where any female or group of females start making a mental or physical list of what they want in a man. Lists are absolutely stupid. Love is unpredictable and shouldn't be put in a box. Sure, six-pack abs and a huge salary can be awesome, but the sweet guy with the messy hair and cute dimples might be the right one, even if he doesn't have guns of ste
On the contrary, the list was supposed to be a fun game and nothing more, which made me thankful that I wasn't going to have to hate the characters in this book for being ultra-shallow.Mr. Perfect is a romantic suspense/murder mystery book with a side of comedy.
Suspense is not my preferred genre, and cops are not my preferred type of hero, but Linda Howard surprised me by making both work in her favor because I ended up really liking this book!It must have been that side of comedy which made the book feel like it wasn't as somber as it could have been.
4.5 STARS
Worst of all, they also attracted the attention of a very disturb and sinister mind who will stop at nothing to hurt them.
I always find it fascinating when a romance author tries to subvert a well known trope, in this case the insta-attraction or insta-lust trope, and give us something different.Of course, this dislike turned into something a lot more pleasant when Jaine saw Sam in his birthday suit outside her kitchen window.
LH described Sam's nakedness and Jaine's reaction to it in way that make you laugh and turn you on at the same time.
Well, in this story, you get a list detailing what these friends think it takes to make the perfect man.
Well, in this story, you get murder!I’ve had this book on my shelves for quite awhile and whenever my Goodreads friends would talk about Linda Howard’s books, Mr. Perfect was sure to be listed as one of her very best, and almost always a favorite.
And let me just tell you now, it’s true what they say; you should never judge a book by its cover.Mr. Perfect  was a fun, fast paced, sexy read and once I got started I just couldn’t put it down.
And of course, grammatical integrity, consistent voice and a plot that takes more thought than a infant can muster would just be TOO MUCH for a romance reader to handle.EXCERPT:Why on earth her mother had wanted her to baby-sit the cat, instead of Shelley or Dave, was beyond her.
Every time she tried to pet him now, he arched his back and hissed at her.To top it off, Shelley was mad at her because Mom had chosen Jaine to baby-sit her precious BooBoo. After all, Shelley was the oldest, and obviously more settled.
This is an old book but I see that most of her books have now been released on Kindle - Lucky Me - Not So Lucky my Credit Card!!!! I have read a few of Linda's other books and loved them. This was a great story with a spunky, sassy heroine and a gorgeous hero - wouldn't mind a bit of Sam living next door to me. Sad, funny, mysterious - it had it all - hopefully the kindle edition will bring a new realm of readers to discover Ms Howard.
This book was very funny and a good romantic suspense.
The interaction between Jaine and Sam was hilarious.
She is a bit of a spit fire and he has a bit of a temper.
I love the part where she sprays him with the hose then he hold her against her car.
She tells him he is holding her against her will but he says he isn't, he is holding her against her car.
The diagolue was great and the suspense portion was good.
This is a great read if you enjoy a laugh, good romance and a bit of suspense!

Pero me lo he pasado tan bien con él, sobre todo hasta el último tercio de que le voy a dar las 4 estrellasAnalizando, lo cierto es que la historia de ellos es muy inverosímil.
Pero esto es América en donde todo es posible!!!Sobre el suspense..
Y creo que a la autora le ha pasado lo mismo.Es una novela bastante corta que se lee rápida, con una historia increíble y llena de muchos tópicos pero si os queréis reír un rato, no lo dudéis
4.5 - a re-read - not as good the second time around. I sort of knew the "wow" factor so that took away from it.

“If you're looking for Mr. Perfect, you‟re going to spend your whole life being disappointed, because he doesn‟t exist.
1 - slightly older, with a beautiful career and a sexy useless toy boy lover at home; Lady no.2 - believes in true love and therefore gets attached to all the assholes out there; Lady no.3 - semi-happily married; and Lady no.4, our heroine - single, disappointed by men but still looking for Mr. Big Mr. Perfect.One Friday evening, after work, these four ladies go out to have a cocktail together and gossip men.
Lady, you really should make yourself a favor and let him divorce you, buy yourself a dildo, more useful, less whiney.And when that evening news list pissed a serial killer off and triggered a murder, that’s when I gave up and decided I’m not so against burning books after all.
Reading this was like solving an intelligent puzzle and I really enjoyed it.The romance was sweet but the sensuality was RAW.
It's hard to write like that when tackling love scenes.
Her sexy time is short but packs an intensity no lengthy and drawn out sex scene can ever accomplish.I know I've mentioned this in previous reviews of her books, but when it's that good it deserves mentioning all over again.
That's a man in charge of himself and confident in his abilities!There was a scene early on when Jaine catches Sam in his kitchen, naked, chugging back a container of milk.
A few people had a hard time with the insta-love between Jaine and Sam, but for some reason it didn't bother me a bit.
In fact I felt it added to Sam's incredible charm and cocky appeal.
He knew what he wanted, and he didn't waste any time playing games.
What's not to love about that?
I have to admit, I have a serious girl-crush on Jaine.
A girl after my own heart.
She also didn't even try to fight off the strong feelings she had for Sam. No head games here.
She was in love with the big jerk.
This book was perfect!
I have nothing bad to say, everything was amazing but there was one Itsy Bitsy thing that had me eye rolling!(view spoiler)[the part when they first have sex, and they know each other only couple of weeks.
And he tells her not just "I love you" but "will you marry me" (hide spoiler)]I mean, really?!?!
This doesn't happen even in new insta love books which are full of things like that.
Sam was one prefect assh@ole and I loved everything that came out of his mouth.And I am def reading other books by this author, especially if there are lots of others assh@oles!
Jaine works in an office with a bunch of computer nerds who provide us with some slightly funny signs on the elevators each morning. “FIRST YOU PILLAGE, THEN YOU BURN. THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLY WILL BE SUSPENDED FROM THE RAIDING TEAM.”  That was the funniest one, in my opinion, but I like nerdy gamer stuff sometimes, and it only got a tiny half-smile out of me. No lol-ing.What also didn't make me Lol was when Jaine gets together with three of her friends and they write a list describing what would
No lol-ing.What also didn't make me Lol was when Jaine gets together with three of her friends and they write a list describing what would be their perfect man.
So this written "list" gets picked up by an office worker who prints it in their newsletter, which somehow makes it to a local news station who talks about it as a human-interest story, and then comes to national attention via an employee with a sister who works at Good Morning America.Craziness ensues.The price of fame.And the other price of fame?
4  stars – Romantic SuspenseI love the line, "The wheel's still going around, but her hamster's dead".I love this verbal sparring scene between the H/H, (page 18):"I haven't had any sleep, any breakfast, or any coffee. I'd better leave before I hurt you." He nodded. "That's a good idea. I'd hate to have to arrest you." She stared at him, taken aback. "What?" "I'm a cop," he said, then turned and walked back into his house. Jaine stared after him, shocked. A cop? "Well, fuck," she said.

This is me at the beginning, the middle and the end of this amazing book:I laughed. I swooned. I laughed some more. My ovaries overheated because of Sam. I laughed - again. I was shocked. I loved every word of Mr. Perfect. Read this!

One of my favorites by Linda Howard!!!Jaine, Luna, Marci, and TJ are co-workers and best friends who meet one Friday after work at their normal meeting place for dinner, their conversation turns into what would make the perfect man.
All of their confrontations are entertaining and fun and will have you laughing out loud at times!!Now throw in a daranged killer who takes a personal offense to "The List" which has captured national attention after going viral.
The four friends are now targets of a killer, and as Sam and Jaine's relationship heats up, Sam dedicates all his time to catching the person targeting the ladies of "The List"...including Jaine.
This book was soooo GOOD!!! I absolutely loved the chemistry between Sam and Jaine!!! I especially liked their “no nonsense” approach to their relationship. The plot was intense for a Linda Howard book because I hadn’t read one of her suspense books before this. Another winner!!!
This is the best book I've read by Linda Howard, so far that is.
I wish to recommend it to all my friends.Mr.Perfect not only assures you to have a great time, but you can also be sure that once you start reading this book, the pages will turn like there is no tomorrow.
The mystery and thriller the chills, a book usually doesn't make me react like this, but this one sure did.
I literally forced myself to finish this book.It was well written and till they killed the 1st woman/h's BFF, I enjoyed it.
But well, the murders bothered me.
The 1st victim was the best of their ladies-group.
Very likable woman.
The 2nd victim was nice, but weak toward her man (who screwed around on her for one year and then suddenly wanted her and she accepted his lame excuse, the day before she was killed).
What was the purpose of all this?!I'd rather stop rambling, coz it doesn't make sense even to me...I wanted to like it more.And where is the epilogue?!
Remember the discussion thread on Amazon several months ago where the boardies discussed their favorite lines in a book?
"I'm not holding you against your will; I'm holding you against your car." This book was full of verbal sparring between Jaine Bright and her neighbor, Detective Sam Donovan, that was downright hilarious at times.
Their first kiss takes place when Jaine is washing her car - no spoilers here!
- but it is one of the funniest and sexiest that I have ever read.The storyline of the four friends and their silly list of qualifications for Mr. Perfect makes for a nice secondary plot.
I was up till 5:30 in the morning finishing this and when I got to the end I wanted more, more Jaine and Sam. I loved the romance and wanted so much more.
Sam has a habit of sneaking up on her and she has a habit of using a lot of cuss words and they have a hilarious conversation about eggs.On a Friday night after work, she and her friends make a list of Mr Perfect and that list goes public and viral bringing a lot of attention to them and a psycho killer.
Even the fights between Jaine and Sam were sexy.
“Tell me something,” he said conversationally, strolling beside her as she stalked, as best as she was able, to her car. “Is there ever a day when you don’t pick a fight?”“The days when I don’t see you,” she shot back.  I have read many books, and this book is still the book with the best bantering between the hero and the heroine. I LOVE this book, have re-read it many times, and it’s still one of my favorite books of all time.   It was a good thing she was off men, or she really might have ch
He’s a cop that works strange hours, trying to work on his house in his spare time, and his new neighbour has something against him getting sleep.
I loved the hilarious banter between Janie and Sam, their scorching attraction, and the fact that the more time they spent together the more they wanted to be in each other’s company.
“Is it possible for men to have PMS?”“They don’t need it,” Jaine said, thinking of her jerk of a neighbour – a cop jerk.
If you love hilarious banter between main characters, a romance that is so hot it will burn your fingers and a very suspenseful plot, this is the book for you.
Needless to say, when I first read this book, I rated it 5 stars.I love Romantic Suspense novels.
as you all know I started as a reader with a John Grisham book at age of 8 so I love suspense, crimes and mysteries, add some romance to these genre, and I'm so sold.
And of course the suspense made the romance more amazing.The first time we are introduced to Jaine, she was having a problem with her neighbor whose name she doesn't know yet (she's new to the neighborhood) and whom she thought is a drunkard.
It was the "suspense" part of this "romantic suspense" story that ruined it for me.The plot is centered on a woman-hating serial killer who targets Jaine and her close-knit group of friends because they made up a silly list of the attributes they would wish on an ideal man, a "Mr. Perfect", which became a viral national news interest story and sparked a kind of gender war between the women who rallied to their "sisters" and the men who were offended and disgusted by some of the items on the list.My problem is that it was very difficult for me to imagine that the list the ladies came up with would elicit any interest in the media or outrage people.
Can we please revive Jaine and Sam and plunk them down in a worthy story?
As if this weren't reason enough to dust off your old copy of Mr. Perfect, or indulge in purchasing a brand new copy, Laura Hick's fabulously, gifted narration makes this a story that is a fantastic audiobook pick!Ladies the world over have at one time or another pondered the question: What kind of man would be the perfect man?
Fortunately, for Jaine Bright, one of the four list makers and the main heroine from the Mr. Perfect romantic arc perspective, she has one rather irritating and yet equal parts alluring neighbor (Sam Donovan) who may just be the answer to this potentially dangerous situation.
a plot involving Martians would be more plausible than this crap.
Me ha pasado algo curioso con este libro.
La parte que concierne a la relación entre los protagonistas, es decir Jaine y Sam, me ha resultado divertidísima, en especial sus diálogos que no tienen desperdicio.
Me ha parecido que ésta no ligaba bien con la historia de amor que, por otro lado, ha ido demasiado precipitada, aunque entiendo a Jaine porque con ese hombre no se puede🔥😂 En fin, que todo esto me ha chocado mucho y al final se ha quedado en una puntuación más intermedia.
