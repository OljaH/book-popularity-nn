The one book Jung published which stands out as an exception is his Psychological Types.
It is also a survey of the history of ideas, of philosophy in the West, a sort of psychologizing Hegelian Phenomenology.
As such, it is very ambitious and, in a demonstration of his broad educational background, credible in its achievement.As a young man, going through the Collected Works as they got published, volume by volume, this particular book awoke an interest in philosophy which eventually resulted in graduate studies in the field.
Although Jung himself disliked Hegel and was barely acquainted with his work, reading the Types helped me understand the concept behind the Phenomenology of the Spirit.
In the top five of the most important books for any serious student of humanity to read.The erudition of Jung in making his argument is breathtaking, and demanding of multiple reads before the breadth and depth of his argument can be fully appreciated.
This book is an embodiment of Jung's transcendent function in that it unites the history of events with the history of ideas but without being a history book.The 'psychological typology' section, which is very short and often what is included in anthologies, is excellent.
However, without reading the entire book, the depth and applicability of his argument becomes more an expression of an idea than a summation of an argument and is less convincing.
This book has influenced my life more than any other book besides the scriptures. It is not a book I would read over and over again like I would the scriptures, or the book Approaching Zion by Hugh Nibley, yet, the book has been a vital, seminal work for my own work on temperament types. Jung's Psychological types and the book Please Understand me II have have been the platform for my research and obsession with the dichotomies in human nature.
The implications of this are enormous, and Jung acknowledged that it would take a much more comprehensive study of the history of ideas to flesh out different subjective impulses and how they influenced human thought than he could provide alone, but he nonetheless attempted a cursory look at how subjective orientations have influenced major thinkers historically in the realms of theology, philosophy, poetry, and finally, in Jung's own age, the budding field of psychology.
Tertullian, on the other hand, was a natural "thinker" who made a similar act of self-sacrifice and suppressed his own rationality in order to develop the irrational parts of his personality through his Christian writings.
Minha edição deste livro caiu da prateleira hoje e como esta é razoavelmente pesada e velhinha, acabou-se por partir ao meio.
O estranho não foi isso e sim o fato que durante a queda o livro partiu igualmente ao meio o poster de Kill Bill Volume 2 que ficava alí do lado.
O que dizia o livro entre as páginas partidas?"O homem sempre esquece, e volta sempre a esquecer, que o que foi bom uma vez nem sempre pode continuar a sê-lo por toda eternidade.
A rapport of this kind is by far the most frequent; it rests on mutual projection which later becomes the source of many misunderstandings.” On "The Inferior Function" - which I find really interesting: “Most people, when the question of their inferior function is in any way touched upon become terribly childish and touchy; they can’t stand the slightest criticism but always feel attacked, for they are uncertain of themselves and, with that, naturally they tyrannize everybody around them; everybody has to walk carefully.
The basis for the theory of psychological types.
The basis for Meyers Briggs and a number of other, in my opinion, less accurate, but more popular, theories of types.
The book is a bit hard to read, though easier than some of Jung's works, and the core of the type theory section is really only about 75 pages in the middle of the book and can stand alone.
His examples are good and the theory can be diagrammed as a series of diagrams.
Understanding this theory of types can be a revelation about people you know and how and why that act as they do.
Matyt Jungo ir mano asmenybiniai tipai taip skiriasi, kad to, kaip jis juos aprašo, man suvokt nelemta (bandžiau jau ne vieną kartą). Visai patiko istorinė tipologizavimo bandymų apžvalga, ypatingai dalis skirta Šilerio pažiūroms.
In Ch. 5, Jung hints at his experience through the story of Prometheus, who "like his God, turns away from the world, from the periphery, and gazes inwards to the centre, the 'narrow passage' of rebirth.....the psyche begins to 'work' and creates a product that wants to get out of the unconscious into consciousness." He stands in contrast to Epimetheus, who is spellbound by outer nature and cannot fathom the reality of the inner.
Psychological Types, it turns out, is a radical work of religion, one with supreme value we struggle to fathom because it points within, where we still see only stuff.
人其實並無法被簡單的劃在某個榮格作為範例寫出的心理類型中，因如同書中對libido趨向的諸多描述，libido流向的可能性中便包含了這些類型，而榮格要表達的意思是人的心理類型實在太多了，只是先以這些類型做例子而已，畢竟論述得先簡化龐雜的體系想法後才能有切入點。既然心理類型反映的是libido的流動，那麼我對libido的感受則是其類似非封閉系統中的entropy，能量存在著受外界影響而增加或是自主對外做工的可能，並依entropy的特性，在非穩定狀態下尋找平衡的可能。最後回到在精神分析的應用上，我認為若從觀察者與被觀察者的方式來判斷被觀察者的心理類型組成，在關鍵細節上極容易產生偏誤。由於觀察者依據自己的個人心理來主導自己的觀察，因此觀察者對被觀察者的判斷極容易受本身的主觀影響。且在潛意識的影響下，人不可能對自己完全誠實(即使他盡可能地在第一人格做到)，因此在觀察者必有偏誤下，邏輯上也只有知道自己意識動機的被觀察者有能力對自己做出判斷。
Admittedly a very important book - probably Jung's most important work, and by far his most accepted "legacy" in the wider field of Psychology.
I would have given it 5 stars, if it were not for its intense LAG the first 260ish pages.
In an attempt to review introversion/extraversion in various related and nonrelated fields, he wanders and meanders, and the reader is like to get lost in his ruminations.
4 stars because of its legacy, but no more because of the confusing style.
Limited by the Kantian worldview, Jung supposes psychology to be the defining science in the study of the human person, and thus precludes the possibility of there being something higher than the psyche in the nature of man. Nevertheless, Jung himself acknowledges that psychology pertains purely to the psyche, and proceeds accordingly, analyzing the problem of opposing types & functions first from the perspective of past poets & philosophers (recontextualizing them psychologically), and then from his own experience. A highly useful text that sheds light on man's inner operations.
The most lasting of Jung's popular theories. What the Myers/Briggs typology test is based on.
I enjoyed this book, and I might want to mention that when Goethe writes to Schiller, saying their letter exchanges and talks they have enable him to understand the people he used to have no clue to understand, which noticeably broadened his horizon on people and other things, (which is also a detail mentioned by Jung in the "Schiller's Ideas on the Type Problem" part), this is exactly what I want to say about this book and possibly how if anyone will read about this very book, or books about personality, for the first time might feel.
General description of the types, there are no examples of his own observations, it simply discusses the opinions and conclusions of the others, and he even proud of himself, that the opinion of the others matches with his own.
If there will never have been Jordan, Spitteler or William James and their explanations, there will be no Jung book about the psychological types altogether.
So, as I had already got acquainted with his other works before, and now as I read his other book alongside "psychological types", I can say that he (his worldview) is like a guru or esoteric, or someone like them.
[image error] [image error] [image error] [image error] [image error] [image error] [image error] [image error] [image error]according to Gustav Jung Carl's psychological types:introvert thinking(similar with deduction or deconstruction) is to deduce/extract from existing principles to some individual resultâ¦ and lawyers, manufacturing managers and quality managers are introvert thinking work.. for a manufacturing manager conducts his work in accordance with the existing manufacturing standards
The main focus is the way we use our psychological energy including introvert and extrovert and the internal four functions of each of our types i.e. Sensing, Intuiting, Thinking and Feeling.
No matter who we are, our type automatically determines which of the four internal functions is our dominant function which is our most powerful surviving tool.Carl Jung believed that people have inclinations in using their psychological energy â Extraverted (E) and Introverted (I) to arrange their inner world.
Jung is a genius. If you are interested in MBTI, this book will explain more of how this system came to be. Jung is where it all began and his writing is even more fascinating than learning about the types as Myers and Briggs explain them. It just blows my mind how Jung came to realize the types. Deeply perceptive. I’ve never read a book that makes me consider my own and other personalities around me more than this.
Very impressed with the ideas, and maybe even more the incredible talent for observation. Jung created an entire system out of nothing and it’s as impressive as Mendeleev arranging the periodic table.
Un libro di studio molto complesso, articolato, analitico. Per apprezzarlo appieno è importante avere nozioni di filosofia e storia. L'ultima parte, laddove la descrizione dei tipi diventa la trattazione principale, e un glossario aiuta a sintetizzare i concetti, vi è maggiore chiarezza.
This volume looks at the different psychological types. From the Middle-Ages to the modern.
On pourrait assimilé ces deux types à la diastole et la systole du cœur.La forme vivante de Schiller, et l'image primordiale de Schopenhauer est reprise par Jung en terme de symbole : notion différente de l'appréhension sémiologique conventionnelle de signes, mais une représentation originale qui possède un double caractère réalité et d'irréalité.
En d'autres termes, seul ce qui enferme à la fois la chose et son opposé peut être symbolique (Dans l'unité, la dualité).Toutefois, Jung ne se limite pas à considérer le type psychologique à travers cette seule dichotomie, mais y rajoutes une synthèse basée sur l'étude minutieuse d'articles et contributions d'autres psychanalystes, notamment : Pensée, Sentiment, Sensation, et Intuition.
This is not the easiest read. It's very dense so I'll have to re-read this again to fully digest it. This is my second reading, btw.
Outstanding, insightful, and very likely epoch-making.As a philosopher, I'm always looking for adequate ways to integrate old views and resolve ancient conflicts. The greatest of these may be the everlasting duel between the schools of Plato and Aristotle. Here you have a philosophically unbiased account of empirical evidence for suggesting that this dichotomy of disagreement is perpetuated, not by truth or error per se, but by channels in the unconscious mind (especially the channels of introversion and extroversion) that guide the thinking of each and every individual on Earth.
Great book on the understanding of what makes up individual personality. It was great to see how Jung was able to take what he learned from The Red Book and make that unconscious content conscious in this book. We get to see early talks of the Collective Unconscious and Archetypes. This is a great book for anyone interested in personality and its influence on the Myers-Briggs Typology Test and research.
Carl Jung is an intellect of the highest order. In this book he takes you through the subtle history of psychology from Plato to the 1900's. Fascinating reading, although it can be a bit verbose. If you want to get acquainted with personality theory, this covers a wide spectrum of the subject and is certainly worth picking up.
Una din contributiile esentiale ale lui Jung este tipologia psihologica. O lucrare ampla care cuprinde atat descrierea tipurilor caracteriale teoretice cat si aplicatii practice in diferite domenii unde pot fi intalnite aceste tipuri de personalitate. De asemenea volumul contine si un capitol larg de definire directa de catre autor a principalelor concepte Jungiene
Kinda disappointed this doesn't have much fan fare. It is long but groundbreaking in its time. It is the best primer to date that I would recommend for reading Briggs Meyer. Together the two go a long way in explaining personality types.
Very dense; I'll have to reread this again to fully digest it, I reckon. Perhaps most interesting of all is looking at what Jung said and how some of his successors ran off with it in a direction that I'm sure would leave Jung beside himself.
His perspectives are interesting...
not much of it was relevant to me, I believe; either that, or it was so long I could barely get through some pages
