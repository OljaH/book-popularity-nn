Only liked one poem in the whole book and even then my like isn't very strong.
Ok
I wasn't fond of the overall organization of the book.
Such a twisted view of innocence!I prefer "The Tale of the Adopted Daughter" by Robert Heinlein as a definition of innocence.
Not as profound as what I was expecting, based on his other writing.
