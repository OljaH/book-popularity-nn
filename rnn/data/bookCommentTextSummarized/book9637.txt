For over forty years, he used his time to write, lecture, and promote better conditions for African Americans through his work.
The last line still stands out for me, "life ain't been no crystal stair." Hughes discusses how the African American experience has been full of hardships.
Unfortunately, life was rarely a crystal stair for African Americans when Hughes wrote the majority of his poetry.
Even though the Migration was just picking up steam at the time when he wrote, Hughes recognized the opportunity for freedom for his people and encouraged them to move in his writing.
After reading Isabel Wilkerson’s The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration, which included brief snippets of his writing, I added both this selection of his poetry as well as one of his novels, Not Without Laughter, to my growing list of books to read someday.
He was a prolific author, publishing numerous collections of poetry and short stories, novels, plays, non-fiction, and books for children.
This particular collection is one which Hughes himself selected from his various volumes of published poetry.
And Harlemesque.Harlem Night SongCome,Let us roam the night togetherSinging.I love you.AcrossThe Harlem roof-topsMoon is shining.Night sky is blue.Stars are great dropsOf golden dewDown the street A band is playing.I love you.Come, Let us roam the night togetherSinging.Harlem Renaissance Couple, from James Van Der Zee's historical collectionIn The Big Sea Hughes wrote about Gladys Bentley, the pianist who played the piano at a small club (since she wasn't allowed at the famous "Cotton Club" which sat in the middle of Harlem) "from ten in the evening until dawn, with scarcely a break between the notes, sliding from one song to another, with a powerful and continuous underbeat of jungle rhythm." He writes of people like Bentley in this collection, the starving artists denied their talent and denied jobs.
The collection is divided into thirteen sections that familiarize readers with the vast scope of Hughes's interests: love, despair, racism, suicide, hope, music, community, and freedom are only a few of these poems' subjects.
Compiled in 1967, Selected Poems to some extent glides over how politically radical so much of Hughes's work was, especially the anti-capitalist poetry he wrote during the 1930s.
Despite that, the poems that are included in this volume are flawless, making the collection the perfect introduction to the writings of one of America's best poets.
I finished this collection and was thrilled to have discovered more of Hughes poetry. This poetry collection is separated into thirteen sections. The themes of each section are very different yet the poems fit perfectly in each one. The themes cover race, religion, love, society, and just plain living. The poems are lyrical and some only contain a few words. Life of Fine and After Hours are two of my favorite sections. For those avid poetry lovers definitely this is a must read. I4m so glad I finally own a book that contains Hughes poetry.
This collection was great.
I, Too.I, too, sing America.I am the darker brother.They send me to eat in the kitchenWhen company comes,But I laugh,And eat well,And grow strong.Tomorrow,I'll be at the tableWhen company comes.Nobody'll dareSay to me,"Eat in the kitchen,"Then.Besides,They'll see how beautiful I amAnd be ashamed—I, too, am America.Merry-Go-RoundWhere is the Jim Crow section On this merry-go-round, Mister, cause I want to ride?Down South where I come from White and colored Can't sit side by side.
Down South on the train There's a Jim Crow car.
On the bus we're put in the back—But there ain't no back To a merry-go-round!
I'm always talking about Langston Hughes to my students and especially his poem "I, too sing America" but never read more than a few of his poems, and so I had a certain idea about his style and topics...
I discovered other aspects about Langston Hughes that I didn't even suspect: his humour, his concern about women.
I knew his fight for freedom and for equality, but I didn't know that he was a great storyteller!
He also reminds me of Walt Whitman in certain aspects.
He is also a great musician: his poems must be read aloud or listened to!
The speaker catches firelooking at their faces.His wordsjump down to standin listener's places.The majority of these appear to be but lyrics, slinking, slight. Maybe slivers. Reflective and jagged. I struggle again with questions unposed.I don’t imagine this collection will change many lives but there remains a necessary presence as we idly ignore our origins. I see the tropes today. Just below the haze and away from the anger.
I don't read much poetry, but reading Sylvia Plath's Ariel last week inspired me to read a little more.
And so I picked up a collection of Langston Hughes' poems.
Langston Hughes is one of the few poets I have read before, at least a little.
I don't know much about Hughes but after reading this collection he seems like someone who would have been fun to hang out with —the kind of person who could come up with a funny poem on the spur of the moment if you were having a bad day.
This is an amazing collection of poetry.
I am a huge lover of Langston Hughes' poetry.
Despite the fact that I am a white woman who will never know the depths of racism African Americans had to endure in this country, I honestly feel like Hughes helped all those who weren't going through this plight understand and be sympathetic to the cause.
His poetry makes me want to be a better person.
It inspires tolerance and understanding.This book was a fabulous collection of Hughes' work.
This will definitely be a collection I will acquire for my classroom library.
Remembering university classes and the first ones that never die...DreamHold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dielife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly.Hold fast to the dreamsFor when dreams golife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow.
Hughes uses the rhythms of African American music, particularly blues and jazz in his poetry.
Later in his life Langston Hughes was called the "Poet Laureate of the Negro Race," a title he enjoyed and encouraged.
He wanted to tell the stories of his people in ways that reflected their actual culture, including both their suffering and their love of music, laughter, and language itself.In addition to leaving us a large body of poetic work, Hughes wrote eleven plays and countless works of prose, including the well-known “Simple” books: Simple Speaks His Mind, Simple Stakes a Claim, Simple Takes a Wife, and Simple's Uncle Sam. He edited the anthologies The Poetry of the Negro and The Book of Negro Folklore, wrote an acclaimed autobiography (The Big Sea) and co-wrote the play Mule Bone with Zora Neale Hurston.
I admit that I haven’t studied poetry in an academic setting enough yet to critique it structurally, but I do read my fair share of it, and this collection includes some of my absolute favorite poetry I have ever read.
I love that Hughes is a vernacular poet but has a beautiful style of verse and rhythm at the same time.
I love the way he portrays things like religion, music, and love.
Every single poem is so genuine and truly speaks.
Langston Hughes is no doubt one of America’s most talented and important poets and should be read by absolutely everyone.
So I bought this just tonight and figured I'd go through it at a leisurely pace, rolling the words around in my head, you know.
Yeah, not so much.
Ate it in a few hours, and I'm going back through now to revisit and order my thoughts.
There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said -- this is beautiful, lyrical, heartwrenching, clever, funny, brutal stuff by turns (and sometimes all at once), and I can't get enough.
What a commentary that even the ones written about social issues some 90 years ago and are still so very relevant, too.
Before I picked up the Selected Poems of Langston Hughes, I was familiar with some of his more famous poems like "Harlem (Dreams Deferred)",  "A Negro Speaks of Rivers", "The Weary Blues", and "I, Too"but I didn’t know much more than that.
But I really loved the gospel feel to poems like “Feet O’ Jesus,” “Tambourines,” and “Prayer Meeting.” Most of them seemed to fall in the section of the book made up of selections from Hughes’ book of poetry, Feet of Jesus and I enjoyed them so much that I am seriously thinking of picking up the entire book to see if there are other poems in a similar style that I could check out.
BROTHERS by Langston Hughes''We're related - you and I,You from the West Indies,I from Kentucky.Kinsmen- you and I,You from Africa,I from the U.S.A.Brothers- you and I''simple but poignant... that was the ease of reading Langston Hughes' poetry and reflect on his words... simple but true in every way
LoveLove is a wild wonderAnd stars that sing, Rocks that burst asunderAnd mountains that take wing.John Henry with his hammerMakes a little spark, That little spark is loveDying in the dark. TOTALLY dig this poetry collection! Langston Hughes captured jazz and blues perfectly!
Good to read in long stretches. Poems flow from one to the next.
I found, thirty-six years later, I still had it almost by heart when my 5th grader mentioned she had to write a paragraph about it at school.What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry upLike a raisin in the sun?Or fester like a sore--and then run?Does it stink like rotten meat?Or crust and sugar overlike a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.Or does it explode?I've come back Selected Poems many times, in grad school when I wrote a seminar paper on homoeroticism in Hughes, and again when my oldest child did a project on Hughes five years ago when he was in 5th grade.
Most recently, my family read this book at bedtime, four poems a night, for over two months.
Hughe's direct, lyrical, life-affirming, funny, angry, gentle, loving poems still speak loud and clear.
We read the last poem in the book "Freedom's Plow," last night.
Refugee in AmericaThere are words like FreedomSweet and wonderful to say.On my heart-strings freedom singsAll Day everyday.There are words like LibertyThat almost make me cry.If you had known what I knewYou would know whyLangston Hughes
Every facet of life, in a few hundred poems that you can hum along to.
This was a revisit of Hughes's amazing work. Besides the most well-known and often quoted poems that I frequently taught in class there are many more obscure poems that are outstanding. This collection gives a fuller view of Hughes's talent and experiences.
This collection of poems by Langston Hughes made for a good read on a quiet evening. Some poems were entertaining, enchanting, dark, amusing, and sad. The poems were categorized by subject and while I liked Hughes’ distinct voice, I didn’t care for some of them. I did like how Selected Poems provided a good variety of his work, giving me a good idea of his style of writing.
"Graduation" actually would have been my top choice to transcribe but it's quite long; but the combination of melodic and evocative writing, race issues, and women's issues is incredible.Moonlight Night: CarmelTonight the waves marchIn long ranksCutting the darknessWith their silver shanks,Cutting the darknessAnd kissing the moonAnd beating the land's Edge into a swoon.SilhouetteSouthern gentle lady,Do not swoon.They've just hung a black manIn the dark of the moon.They've hung a black manTo a roadside treeIn the dark of the moonFor the world to seeHow Dixie protects Its white womanhood.Southern gentle lady,Be good!Be good!
A wonderful collection of poetry written and selected for this book by poet Langston Hughes. My favorites were from the 'Shadow of the Blues' and 'Madam to You' sections, but all the poems are great and prolific. Hughes' work ranges from light and humorous poems about Madam Alberta K Johnson to pieces that echo the Civil Rights movement. ‘Freedom’s Plow’ is timeless, a poignant poem that holds as much meaning today as when it was first penned. I found inspiration in the last section particularly, in the face of the political turmoil we as Americans face today.
This poem was very well written in a time (early 20th century) that must have been frustrating, depressing, and awful for people of good conscience:Democracy will not comeToday, this yearNor everThrough compromise and fear.I have as much rightAs the other fellow hasTo StandOn my own two feetAnd own the land.I tire so of hearing people say,Let things take their course.Tomorrow is another day.I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.I cannot live on tomorrow's head.FreedomIs a strong seedPlantedIn a great need.I live here too.I want freedomJust as you.I wasn't sure how I'd deal with poetry.
While we as a society have made leaps and strides in the favor of Freedom and Liberty, we are still on the same path, and the works held in this volume still ring as true as ever.Every school child, elementary through high school age, should read at least a few works of Langston Hughes.
Start with "Freedom's Plow" and continue with "Freedom Train" and "Negro" and go from there.It seems maybe we are starting to forget just how hard of a journey it has been, and how much work we have remaining.
No Man is an Island onto themselvesThe Flip Side of a Harlem's "Weary Blues" sounds as smooth....Bla
*3.75I remember reading some of these [around three?] in 8th grade - the one about a crystal stair, English B, and a dream deferred.
I plan to read more [as he is my chosen - or, technically, someone else chose for me - poet for English] and I think I'll be able to fairly analyze his work and emulate his style.
I'm curious to see what the 'unselected' poems consist of.
I guess the main reason I'm not giving it higher is that a fairly small percentage of the poems really affected me.
How dynamic, bold, and expressive a character Langston Hughes epitomizes.
Irrevocably defiant and inspired, Hughes solidifies his role as one of the more forceful and prolific voices in American Literature...Lover's Return: My old time daddyCame back home last night.His face was pale andHis eyes didn't look just right.He says, “Mary, I'mComin' home to you—So sick and lonesomeI don't know what to do.”Oh, men treats womenJust like a pair o' shoes—You kicks 'em round andDoes 'em like you choose.I looked at my daddy—Lawd!
and I wanted to cry.He looked so thin—Lawd!
that I wanted to cry.But the devil told me:Damn a loverCome home to die!
