Though I had no reservations about reading Tricks, some of the issues in Identical were a little too close to home for me, and I was afraid of triggering unwanted memories.
After listening to the audio version, I borrowed the book just to see how the 16-year-old identical twins, Kaeleigh's and Raeanne's thoughts were shaped.
While the characters were easy to get to know, I found the issues covered a bit too overwhelming and excessive foreshadowing revealed a plot twist that was not a big surprise to me by the book's conclusion.
Still, a mostly satisfying read and I look forward to Hopkins' other titles.
I think this is Ellen Hopkins's most effed up book. (That I've read anyway) I saw the ending coming from a mile away, otherwise this would have gotten a higher rating from me. I wish it had been a bit more subtle, because I felt like there were way too many obvious clues that hinted at what was revealed at the end there.
I felt this book, unlike Burned which I loved, just went too far.
I can't explain, I usually really like books that are controversial and stretch boundaries but...
Basically, it's the story of identical twins, almost completely alike except one is the reluctant centre of her father's attention...
sexual attention.
The other twin feels unloved by her father and longs to please him...
That was the part of this book that made my stomach churn, not so much the abuse of one twin but the incestuous desires of the other.
I read it in a few hours and was gripped in a manner that can only be described as 'horrified'.
DNF @ 65%  I legit only picked up this book bc the **plot twist** was said to be MIND BOGGLING and after searching through spoilers I found that, yes, it is a pretty good plot twist, but I could PHYHSICALY not put up with this book any longer. The Writing- I came looking for free verse poetry but the writing was bland and v v tiring - when I wasn’t puking my guys out bc of how messed up the book was I was falling asleep- also everything is so drawn out- like plz edit through man  The Plot- what
-	its like messed up af(rench fries)-	and like whats THE REASON ???-	is this to show like this happens to people bc I don’t think that’s v realistic -	idk its weird and I cant relate and I just hated it-	the plot twist isn’t worth it-	id rather not be scarred for the rest of my lifeTheres more I wanted to say but I have no energy to speak of this book any longer.
I have to say, this book is pretty amazing.Basically it's about these two twins, Kaeleigh and Raeanne.
And this is just the beginning of the horrible suffering the twins face in this book.As a teenager myself, I must admit that sometimes I cringed while reading the book and had to put it down for a second.
(read the individual words as they go down the page.)The twist at the end was...
Overall, if you are a fan of Ellen Hopkin's previous works this will be another amazing read through, if not, then it won't hurt to give it a try.
www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comThis book was amazing and it tore me apart :( I had a feeling I knew where it was going and it did but in a little bit of a different way.
This author can write some amazing ~ heart-wrenching books..
Won't watch me undress.*END OF EXCERPT*The things that Kaeleigh endures while Raeanne has to watch and feels helpless is so atrocious, but it happens.
It's not a pretty story, all things come from somewhere...
This is a brilliantly sad story and I will continue on with all of the author's books I have yet to read.
In this case, Kaeleigh is sexually abused by her father while her twin sister, Raeanne, isn’t.
At the end of the book, you learn that Raeanna actually died in the car accident caused by Ray and Kaeleigh has multiple identities, living through herself and her twin sister to cope with the sexual abuse.
But the ending didn’t settle right with me; it felt too much like a copout.And the fact that, rather than focus on one issue, Hopkins threw in sexual abuse, bondage, teacher-student relationships, parents’ separation, rape, child p*rnography, pr*stitution, drags, and alcohol abuse.
I can certainly say that this is one of my favorite books now.
In the beginning, I couldn't help but to think what the ending would be like.
Once I got to the ending everything made sense to me and I couldn't help but to stare at my wall for a few minutes with my mouth wide open.
I think I need to re-read it.
I never want to re-read a book straight after finishing it.
Read this book.
It's written prose-y and you can certainly read it like a real book once you get by it's format.
One family - damaged by tragedy.
A father who drinks too much; an absentee, professionally-driven mother.
Twin girls left in the middle.
One daughter attracts the inappropriate attention of their damaged father.
Both girls suffer in silence, living behind the facade of a perfect, all-American family.Ellen Hopkins has written another gripping novel in verse that will leave you on the edge of your seat.
Prepare for your jaw to drop when you reach the end of this gripping tale.
I have Crank in my middle school library, but I WOULD NOT have this one available to them.
2.5 starsI doubt I'll ever cotton to the literary stylings of Ellen Hopkins (that faux-poetry thing drives me nuts; she's no Jacqueline Woodson, that's for damn sure) but I suspect Identical will strike a chord of truth for incest survivors and others who've grown up in exceedingly dysfuctional families like the one that identical twin sisters Kaeleigh and Raeanne endure here. About as subtle as unanesthetized oral surgery, and (for me, anyway) just as painful to endure.
Her father loves her too, but not the way a father should.Raeanne knows about her father's visits to Kaeleigh's bed.
While a part of her wants to protect Kaeleigh, another part of her feels jealous because her father didn't pick her.
Their father, lonely and tortured by his own terrible secret, drinks to escape his demons.
I would have liked to have read more about Kaeleigh's relationship with her father and also about the events in his childhood that set him on the path of the abuser.
I wanted to know more about what happened AFTER Kaeleigh faced the truth.
Laci is a huge fan of Ellen Hopkins and she had been trying to get me to read one of her books for a long time.
And when opportunity comes knockin, you best answer the door.I read a lot of books.
Identical falls in the former category with a few other books that continue to stay on my mind.This book is engrossing, it’s disturbing, it’s disgusting, it’s addictive, it’s powerful and I loved it.
Now that I’ve read Identical, I know I won’t be able to stop, I’ll have to read Hopkins earlier titles and continue to read her new ones.
But, Ellen Hopkins is really excellent at pulling you through the tough spots with some kind of glimmer of hope that things might turn out alright in the end.At first I hated the sheer number of names Hopkins dumps on the reader right at the beginning--the book is separated into chunks (basically, chapters, but Hopkins doesn't really ever use chapters in her novels) told from the perspective of each twin, with a neat mirror effect with the poetry every time the perspective swaps.
"Liked it" is the closest I can get--I'm glad I read it, but it's really hard for me to really say how much I enjoyed it.
You learn that their father sexually abuses Kaeleigh and Raeanne secretly wants it.Then you LATER learn, Kaeleigh's mother never forgave their father for the car accident he caused in which Raeanna died & the mother was injured.
and they both had a hard time loving someone else after what their father did to them.The sad part is, at the end of the book, or near the end of the book I should say, you learn that Raeanna actually died in the car accident caused by Ray and Kaeleigh had multiple identities, living through herself and her twin sister.It was a really confusing book and makes me wonder where Ellen Hopkins gets her ideas, you know?
It probably won't make you feel, like you've experienced something similar, or know someone who has.
In fact, I might just have to go back to screening the contemporary genre a bit more thoroughly.
Maybe even read the actual description rather than just skim a few lines.
I've actually been wanting to read something by Ellen Hopkins for awhile.
It's one of a small number of books I've actually liked enough to go for the five star rating this year.
I'm definitely reading more of her books.
So the next one will be as soon as I've read a few non-contemporaries.
THE GOOD:* WELL I’M NOT OKAY* at all, jesus fucking christ* it’s 100% better to go into this as blind as possible (aside from trigger warnings, that I’ll list below)* it’s a novel written in verse, which is a format that I’ve never read before, but oh my gosh so cool?!!?* it’s a lot more introspective than I’m used to, but it 100% works bless this* THE PLOT TWIST FUCKING RUINED ME OKAY?!?* I want to tell you all to go read this, but holy cow, this was probably the hardest book I’ve ever read in my entire goddamn life* loved the writing, the characters, the vibe, the story telling - everything is just a big oh mY LORD* everything was NUTS and a fucking roller coaster* i am dEAD™THE BAD: * I legitimately don’t have anything bad to say* HOWEVERSpecial mentions: there are legitimately trigger warnings for everything in existence - sexual abuse, sexual assault, self harm, drug abuse, alcoholism, incest, suicide attempt, eating disorders (bulimia, binge/purge)* guys, I mean it, if you’re even the least bit triggered by anything I listed above, move on.
Once again, Ellen touches on controversial topics and handles them beautifully.
There are some novels out there that touch on controversial topics bluntly and frantically.
And the plot, it was like so damn mysterious until the end.
Nothing is resolved until the last page, and it kinda just makes you want to keep reading, even when it's over.The end was just...
I don't even know, so clever and twisty, and although Ellen's books are fucked up and haunting, I didn't see it coming at all.Five stars, I recommend it to anyone who would like to read something different.
As the marriage between her parents deteriorates, her father- a district court judge with his own past- takes out his sexual frustrations on his daughter.
There was one particularly moment when it is implied that Raeanne wanted to please her father as a child by doing these things and as a teen, still does in the back of her mind.
Despite it all, as usually, I love Hopkins' ability to keep me at the edge of my seat.
have been trying to think of how best to review this first Ellen Hopkins read for me, and B.
:)Having never read Ellen Hopkins, nor a book written in poetry form, I was skeptical if I would like the style or not.
My friend Janie recently read Identical and thought I would like it, and her review really made me want to check this out for myself.
Now, even though I said I've never read anything quite like Identical, I have read books about drug use, promiscuous sex, alcohol abuse, and the like.
Ellen Hopkins and Identical made me feel A LOT.
Let me start by saying that when I read a book, I am usually certain about whether or not I liked it.
I can say that I'm glad I did.Now I know since you're reading this, you have probably heard all about the book from the summary and all the other reviews.
Sure, Kaeleigh learns to stand up for herself.
The fact that I'm frustrated probably means that Ellen Hopkins did her job though.So should you read this book?
If people have a problem with it, then they can read a whole lot of other books out there.
Visit my blog!This is not my first Ellen Hopkins book so I know by now not to expect fluffy bunnies and happily ever after endings.
I know to expect a vivid depiction of exactly how life can be and is for some… but boy oh boy, this one really takes the cake.
Identical is the story of Kaeleigh and Raeanne, 16 year-old identical twins.
Kaeleigh has been sexually abused by her father since she was nine years old.
Raeanne drinks and uses drugs heavily because she feels she’s the lesser twin that isn’t loved like Kaeleigh.
Check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...Kaleigh and Raeanne are identical twins, each with their own dark secret.
Kaeleigh is the focus of her Daddy's affection and Raenne craves the love she never received.
This book is so twisted and dark, it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
I love the alternating perspectives between the two twins.
This is my first Ellen Hopkins book and I can not wait to read more of her work!!!
As I opened up this book and looked at the writing I was like..
It's a 565 pages of poems?
HOW WRONG WAS I!!!!!!!I started flipping through the pages as fast as I could cause I must and needed to know how it ends.
After page 3 I barely noticed it was in poem form and in the middle of the book I realized this author is a genius.
Not only for how unique this book is but her writing style is highly addicting.
**claps loudly for author**This book is messed up.
Like you will be traumatized.
And the ending!
There is “cutting to feel pain” and “throwing up because it’s the only thing I can control” and all other cliche explanations for serious mental health disorders.
Mental health deserves better than generic, Hopkins.However, I do want to look at a small piece of Hopkins’s prose that I find highly relevant to the political world this week:“I didn’t want him to go to prison.He probably would have pulled strings to avoid it, anyway.
Butmore, I didn’t want to testify.”Because testifying would mean reliving it.
Reliving it in front of the world.
And you don’t get to just relive it.
That was a clue that perhaps this book was written for the shock value, and not entirely for tackling the issue.
What soured this book for me is that I didn't think she was actually tackling the big issue, I think she was writing to get a rise.
And she got one, but not in a good way.I think that I'd be interested to read Crank, because that was based on her daughter, so it will probably be less shock-value and more actual value.
)I get that Ellen wants to tackle the very real problems of child molestation, pedophilia, drug abuse, mental illness....but it felt just very visceral and too much trying to shock you with horrific scenes.
But it felt bleak as if Ellen had decided that since all of her other books have bleak endings, this one should have one too.
I'm not asking for a happy ending, I just think that the more interesting story is watching someone go through something horrible like that and then figure out how to get to the other side.Either way, I think Ellen Hopkins is an incredibly important writer and one every reader needs to explore.
Reading the book Identical was a very different experience for me, in an imaginative sort of way.
It made me think of awful things, it also gave me the feeling of sadness; I actually felt connected to the girls throughout the entire book.
It came so fast without any clues, it was sort of like the auther just threw it in there, just as a way to end the book quicker, which I did not like at all.
The end of the book was very confusing and suprising, it all happened so sudden I didn't have time to process what was happening.When reading Identical I actually learned quite a bit.
I was looking for a quick fluid read to end this month with and I am so glad I picked up this one.
I can't help myself really, her words draw me to tears every time I read her works.
She writes with such raw emotion, you can't help but feel everything she feels, everything her characters feel.From the start you are let inside of Kayleigh's and Raeanne's heads and their messed up lives.
I felt as though I jumped right into the book and lived these lives with them, powerless to help them or heal them.
The reading is so fluid.
4/5 starsI don't know how I didn't see that ending wow not predictable at all. But there some hints but I didn't take it in omg
Kaeleigh is unsure of herself, and unable to love because she is being molested by her.
Ian, her best friend and only good stable thing in her life is completely in love with her.
She loves old people and gets attached to a woman who shares her own tragedies.
Raeanne is a hard ass, promiscuous, drug seeking rebel who loves her father very much and resents her mother.
She is seen as the stronger twin, because Kaeleigh isn't strong enough to say no to people.
I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good, hard core story.
