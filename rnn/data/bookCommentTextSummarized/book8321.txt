I joined the Goodreads group reading the detectives when I found out that they would be reading one Miss Marple case a month for a year.
Yet, her mind is anything but flighty, and, just as it seems to do in St Mary Mead, murder cases fall into Miss Marple's lap.
All this takes place while Miss Marple is supposed to be on vacation, yet, as she has confided in at least one person in each case that I have read, murder seems to find her.
While Hercule Poirot is still my favorite of Agatha Christie's detectives, Miss Marple is starting to grow on me.

I actually had a grandmother who referred to black Americans as 'coloreds.' Think about the sea of societal change iin this time period, from the court case upholding desegregating schools in 1954 (way to go, independent Justice Branch!) to an actual African-American President of the U.S. in 2008.
I mean, processed snack foods--gross.Take Agatha Christie's A Caribbean Mystery, for instance.
Skip those retro bits and you have a delightful mystery in a beautiful setting, although one can't help wish--just a little bit, says Miss Marple--for some actual English weather (not me, though.

The tropics , on an island in the Caribbean Sea, doesn't sound like a place Miss Marple, would feel comfortable in, she is from rainy, cold, with just a little bit of snow, the quiet St. Mary Mead , England.
Young, happy , wealthy couples, running around the Golden Palm Hotel, that name alone says it all , but after a week in the sun , the old woman , begins to start thinking not a bad place , the West Indies, glad she came, if only something exciting would occur.
Mr Rafiel, pushing eternity, but richer than anyone Miss Marple has met, helps her when another murder happens.

This mystery sees Miss Marple relocated from her usual setting, of villages and vicarages, and deposited on a Caribbean holiday by nephew Raymond.
Among the guests are the wealthy Mr Rafiel, attended by assistant Esther Waters and valet/masseur Arthur Jackson, Canon Prescott and his sister, Dr Graham, Major Palgrave and two married couples – Colonel Edward Hillingdon and wife, Evelyn, and Greg and Lucky Dyson.
This is an enjoyable mystery, although it is not one of Christie’s best plots and Miss Marple suffers from a lack of her usual sounding boards and cast of village characters.

Ξαναδιαβάζοντας Άγκαθα Κριστι (που τόσο με είχε σημαδέψει στην εφηβεία μου, παρά λίγο να πάρω αποβολή, γιατί μια πανέξυπνη φιλόλογος στη Β Γυμνασίου με έστειλε στον Διευθυντή επειδή στην έκθεση με θέμα "Το αγαπημένο μου βιβλίο" έγραψα για το "Έγκλημα στη Μεσοποταμία" και το ερώτημα ήταν "αν ήξερε η μητέρα μου ότι διαβάζω τέτοια βιβλία" - "μα τα διαβάζει και αυτή") βλέπω πλέον αυτό που τότε ήμουν μικρός και ανόητος να δω : και Το σπίτι με τους ιβίσκους (έλεος, εκδόσεις Λυχνάρι, "A Caribbean Mystery") είναι ένα ακόμη ψιλορατσιστικό βιβλίο, με βλακώδεις διαλόγους, κακή χρήση της ψυχιατρικής (στα όρια της απαξίωσης) και μια πλοκή γεμάτη με δήθεν red herrings ολούθε, που μπορεί να ήταν ένα χαλαρό pageturner, αλλά στην πραγματικότητα όλα τα παραπάνω σε πετάνε απότομα στη στροφή και ξενερώνεις.
Review to follow.
“She had one weapon and one weapon only, and that was conversation.”It fell rather flat in comparison to other Christie's works, but 1) you can't really blame Miss Marple for not being Hercule Poirot and 2) you can't really blame anyone for not being Hercule Poirot.
They try, they do, but it's not their fault if they fail.
I don't know, it's as if Miss Marple makes everything duller, and Poirot everything shinier.
I can't help feeling this difference and it's not my fault either.
A couple of decades younger, and I'd have wanted him to propose to Miss Marple.
Scratch that, I wanted him to propose and that's it.
Plăcută și captivantă!
I read this one for the "overseas travel" square because it gets Miss Marple out of St. Mary's Mead on a long vacation to the sunny climes of the West Indies.
As is often the case with Christie, the reader must, rather uncomfortably, wade through some casual racism/colonialism/sexism to enjoy the mystery.I don't think that this is one of Christie's best, though.
Her mysteries often rely strongly on coincidence, but this one takes the use of coincidence to a whole new level of ridiculously unbelievable.
I did enjoy the introduction to Mr. Rafiel, and would've liked to hear more about him.
He made a nice counterpoint to Miss Marple.
“It's all very well to talk like that,” said Mr. Rafiel.
“We, you say?
How can you and I set about preventing a murder?
A Caribbean Mystery sees our lovely Ms Marple in the West Indies, where nothing seems to happen when compared to St Mary's Mead, until of course there is a murder, and everyone is a potential suspect.
Many red herrings take us on a variety of paths, but this time a clue is given near the beginning, which will allow some readers to actually find out who is the murderer by the end.
Another excellent Miss Marple book, and although I have seen the Joan Hickson TV adaptation, I cannot remember ever having read the book. I really enjoyed it and liked the introduction of Mr Rafiel, who I know we will see later.I'm really enjoying this whole challenge and we still have a good few to go.
Again, a fantastic literary sleight of hand where the clues are paraded before one's eyes - yet that one crucial piece of misdirection fools one till the end.
Love Agatha! Miss Marple, yay! Since she's not at home, she has to work harder to be taken seriously. This time, for once, I thought I had the murderer figured out. Nope, wrong again.Reread... Just got one question; how did she get rich nephews who buy her Caribbean vacations? (Jealous me)😎
A lovely mystery that started slow and then took some surprising twists and turns near the end.
I was sick this week, so it was a good job I was given a pack of Miss Marples for Christmas.
They made for the perfect sick books.
I do have to mention that this particular one has some racist remarks made by a few characters about the black residents of the island this takes place on, which jolted me out of the narrative each time it happened, especially since it was repeated past the point of “here is this character saying an awful thing so you know they are bad”, into some direct author descriptions and comments made by characters we’re not supposed to hate.
Time and place, of course, but a blot on an otherwise perfectly acceptable mystery in 2017.

Ora, se dovessi accompagnare a Miss Marple un aggettivo, questo sarebbe 'pindaccia'.E' leit motiv del 'le muoiono tutti attorno', insomma, attraverso i gialli, ce l'ha insegnato anche Arthur Conan Doyle, ci è stato insegnato che, la prima qualità di un buon detective, è quella di saper far morire la gente solo con la propria presenza, per poi indagarne eventuali cause di decesso.Si potrebbe pensare che la gente muore per qualche bizzarra congiunzione astrale di altitudine e latitudine proprio a St. Mary Mead, dove l'arzilla vecchietta sfoggia il suo intuito per incastrare assassini vari; si potrebbe pensarlo, ma si verrebbe subito sconfitti con l'argomentazione che, ANCHE AI CARAIBI, lontani di chissà quanti paralleli dalla piovosa Inghilterra, alla signorina Jane Marple, fa seguito immancabile la morte.
I rather suspect that Agatha Christie – aged in her mid-seventies – took a holiday at the Colony Club, Barbados – and from the anonymity of her deckchair secretly wrote the plot for A Caribbean Mystery (1964), through the watchful eyes of her alter ego, Miss Marple.It’s not the strongest of her novels – and perhaps lacks the depth and texture of her classics, which are set in more familiar surroundings and society.
My first encounter with Agatha Christie and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a quick easy read and the mystery kept me guessing until the final reveal. Will pick up another of her books soon, perfect size and length to fit in my handbag anywhere :)
Miss Marple has to try and remember as much as she can of what the Major told her while looking into fellow guests at the hotel.
He doesn’t have much of an opinion of old ladies but once he begins to really converse with Miss Marple, and realises she has brains, his attitude changes and he jumps in to help solve the mystery.This was one I’d read before and remembered the solution to pretty well but there were a few elements that I had forgotten.
Lovely murder mystery, old people rule.
رواية ممتعة لأجاثاوطبعا بالتأكيد لم أحل اللغز ^_^ عادي يعني اتعودت خلاص ^_^ شئ طبيعي أن القاتل يكون أبعد شخص عن خيالك وطبيعي جدا أن يكون هو الشخص الذي تتعاطف معه ، وتقلق عليه ، وتحزن من أجلهوطبيعي أن يكون أمام عينيك طوال الوقت ولا تراهوأن يكون الحل بين أصابعك ولا تنتبه لهوأن تقرأ التفاصيل الدقيقة ولا تتذكرهاعادي .. ^_^ كل هذا مع أجاثا عادي ولكنك ستستمتع(:
loving Agathas sweet, bloody crimes a lot! if you think you know who did it - there will be someone you did not even consider being the killer. She fools me every time!
I saw the Mystery!
This one was a little "fish out of water" for Miss M, sent on a Caribbean vacation by her nephew.
It took her a bit to get her feet under her, she had so many strangers to sort out among her fellow guests and the owners and staff of the hotel.
No supporting cast from her beloved St. Mary's Mead, no one who knows she has a razor sharp mind when it comes to murder and the darkness that lurks beneath the good manners.
A solid 4.5 stars for me, very enjoyable.
A miss Marple mystery in the Caribbean.A short book with an interesting story that did not impress me very much,however i generally enjoyed it,only it felt a bit rushed.Maybe it's the translation.I read it in greek and it felt like some parts of the book were shortened,not sure about that last one but i got this feeling while reading.Three stars from me!
WOW I ACTUALLY PREDICTED THE ENDING. for like the first time ever, I guessed the murderer  correctly  in an Agatha Christie novel. :D :D also, I love Miss Marple so much, xD.
