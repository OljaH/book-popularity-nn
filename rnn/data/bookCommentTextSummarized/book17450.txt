These stories are aggressively competent and aggressively bland. There is a very old fashioned feel to them as if the author yearns for simpler times. The present day stories make sure to note things like iPhones and podcasts as if to remind us that he knows technology exists. The stories also portray a pleasant, multiethnic world where everything has gone the way of Benetton ads and all is well among all of us. But the stories have no teeth. They aren’t memorable. They are aggressively competent but they aren’t necessarily good and they certainly aren’t bad. They just are. Alas.
I was looking forward to Tom Hanks debut unveiling for months....having pre-paid for the audiobook the ‘second’ I learned Tom Hanks was reading HIS STORIES.I was especially excited to ‘listen’ to Skyline High School celebrity classmate render imagery, illuminate and spotlight juicy details with a wide range of textures - feelings and thoughts.
Tom Hanks is as well-qualified to show his writing skills to the world as any other seasoned author.......
It was a smiling-joy for me....Tom Hanks got a great start at our old Skykine High School —� he is not talented, kind, lovable, but a VERY SMART COOKIE!
"In her living room she opened the windows to get a bit of breeze. The sun had set, so the first fireflies of the evening would begin to flare in a bit. She sat on the windowsill and enjoyed the cold, shaped pineapple and watched as squirrels ran along the telephone wires, perfect sine waves with their bodies and tails. Sitting there, she had her second ice pop as well, until the fireflies began to float magically above the patches of grass and sidewalk." I'm not a Hollywood fan, nor I enjoy wa
He is widely loved in Greece, he is widely loved everywhere and quite a few of his films are considered classics of the 7th Art. This collection of short stories is written in a simple, eloquent, flowing writing style.
The story of a boy who loves typewriters and airplanes, living a difficult life after the divorce of his parents.
A story of impeccable writing and immense beauty that reminded me -once again - how much I love typewriters.
Set in the heart of the era of immigration to New York, this story is a hymn to the abilities and persistence of hardworking people who desire a better life, without forgetting their principles and without resorting to shady means.

As a recurring trope this is narrative gold; it really did help to make the stories feel like a collection rather than a load of random bits shoved together, which many writers fail miserably to do.
I feel like they walked on the page the moment I read them, having not experienced life until the moment of that story.
It might be that Hanks just preferred to write about women and chose to give the men the backseat in their passivity here.
Although this is a collection of short-stories, and they do go very well together, I think the characters needed a bit more of a distinguishable voice.

While these stories are still most likely not going to win awards for literary prowess, they were an appropriate read for a lazy day at home as I enjoyed spending a day with Mr. Hanks in a capacity other than acting.Mr. Hanks has focused on a few themes in his writing: children of divorce, movement from small town to big city America, and the use of a type writer.
She is intelligent, an alpha go getter woman, a perfect 21st century renaissance woman, and a character who still grew on me as I read the three stories featuring her.As 2017 moves into its last week (wow), I am happy to have read what was probably the most popular celebrity written book of the year.
I could feel Mr Hanks in these stories; his quirky humour (how do I know what he’s like, well I think I do now?!) shining through to his stories, his first work of fiction.A very different mix of stories, some related, some not.
But this adds to the uniqueness in a way.I love the story ‘Go See Costas’ a Bulgarian man via Greece who survived horrible things arriving to the big land of America, all the while helping his friend arrive in secret, smuggling him off the boat.
I really enjoyed the way the chief of the boat saw this man’s goodness, treats him to a free shave and explains the lay of the land in New York:
a book by the man, the myth, the legend that is tom hanks sounds like a dream come true, right?
im not a fan of short story collections to begin with, but i thought this would different.
i also think this would have been a different experience had i listened to the audiobook - tom hanks narrating his own stories might have lent a more enjoyable tone to the stories.
so sorry im not a fan, hank, but keep it up!
Almost all of the seventeen stories are set in the US, chronicling the lives of men and women from myriad walks of life – an actor on a film-promotion spree, a soldier hardened by his battle days, a writer pecking at typewriters to choose the best one, a businessman abusing money for multiple time travel expeditions, a sportsperson endangering friendship for his bowling skills.
I wish the journey, too, was memorable commensurately.Giving a tentative caress to the typewriter donning its gorgeous crimson red cover, I dispatched the book to my shelf; I, also, left a mental note to myself cajoling that like the actor, Hanks – the author, shall become more appealing and indispensable with time.
Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.Overly sentimental review ahead.
This short story collection is warm, surprising and engaging.
Each story envelops the reader with its own unique sense of place, time and character; the most endearing characters of all may be the typewriters who find their way into every story.
Tom Hanks' vast perspective and experience is relayed with wit and warmth, leaving one craving an audio book with the clacking of typewriters in the background.
My favorites included the Hank Fiset columns, "These Are the Meditations of My Heart" and "Stay With Us."
When my husband picked this up from the library for me, he expressed skepticism that Tom Hanks could write; and I said that if Steve Martin can do it, so can Tom. The first story was clever, about a guy and girl, friends who decide to become more than friends.
Wishing my initial instincts had proven true, I told my husband, "This guy can write!"But from that point on, I couldn't find another story that I felt like finishing.
I think if you count Hanks' films among your all-time favorites, you will probably like this book.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I’ve made it very clear I’m not a big fan of fictional shorts in general, and I really struggle with collections of them.
That being said, now that I’m attempting to dabble in audiobooks they really are the perfect fit for my short commute so I probably need to suck it up and start enjoying them more.
I have been a fan of Tom Hank since I was knee-high to a grasshopper and he starred in (what I now realize was really freaking edgy) my favorite sitcom Bosom Buddies.
I’ve loved him ever since and had zero doubt that he would be able to spin a yarn.
Then I remembered how much I loved Mr You by Mary-Louise Parker and how much I love Tom Hanks, so I couldn't resist the temptation ...Uncommon Type started off promisingly, as the first short story made chuckle a few times.
Many stories were pretty bland and simple.
They weren't bad, the writing was competent, although in some cases it was too simple, with a blow-by-blow type narrative that felt flat.
The themes, characters and periods were varied, with the typewriter appearing in several stories (Tom Hanks is a typewriter collector).Uncommon Type: Some Stories was very readable, albeit not memorable.
While writing on the machine, Hank recalls other times he's used a typewriter: in his dad's store when he was a kid; as the editor of his 8th grade newspaper; during high school typing class; when he was a sports reporter for his college paper; and as a journalist for the Shopper's Guide....which led to him meeting his wife.*****In a bittersweet family story, Kirk - who's turning 19 - goes surfing with his dad Frank....a father-son birthday tradition.
In time Bette discovers that Paul is a different man than she pictured.*****In a fun success story, Sue - a budding young actor from Scottsdale, Arizona - moves to New York City to make it big.
With Uncommon Type: Some Stories, Mr. Hanks has whipped his raincoat open, hollered out a brazen, “Hey!
Some are funny; there are three that involve the same group of friends ("Three Exhausting Weeks", "Alan Bean Plus Four", and "Steve Wong is Perfect") that would make even the crankiest curmudgeon give those neighborhood kids a break, allow them to recover the baseball that landed onto his yard without threatening their lives with his cane, and crack a smile.
All 17 stories in this collection are thoughtful, smart, and absorbing.Yes, it would be easy to hate Hanks.
I listened to Uncommon Type on audio, performed by Tom Hanks himself, and I highly recommend it.
From the very first story, about a laid-back guy who starts dating a go-getting gal, I was smiling and giggling and was excited to keep reading.Tom Hanks is such a likeable guy that I shouldn't be surprised for liking his writing.
And part of the charm is that many of the stories (if not all, I wasn't counting closely) reference in some way a typewriter, which I know in real life Tom Hanks collects.
Highly recommended for fans of short stories and fans of Tom Hanks.
A collection of pleasant, though unremarkable, stories - all tethered to one another by typewriters. I believe most of them were written while Tom was out and about travelling for work, which would account for the vast array of locations and settings. Among my favorites were the stories that featured Anna (atta-baaaaby) and Steve Wong. At least, they were the most memorable for me. But who am I kidding. For the past two weeks, I got to listen to Tom Hanks read to me on my commute to and from work. That was pretty fricken awesome!
I hate leaving books unfinished, but life is too short, and this collection is too long.I just...oh, man, I didn't care.
I found almost every one of these stories as dull as the cover.
The tone was warm and nostalgic and lovely, and I'd read more from him for sure.
Not. Care.
The endings were too abrupt, the characters felt too flat (probably a side effect of the short lengths) and too much time was spent on mundanities.
I'd finish a story and forget what I'd read straight away.
For now, summer is almost over, and I've got no time for boring books.
So turns out that Tom Hanks can spin a quirky little yarn quite well.
The stories in this collection are all beautifully readable and some genuinely compelling.
I liked the tone of them and the variety of themes, all though with the anchor of that typewriter.If you like short stories (I do because I can get through a whole one in my 10 minute coffee breaks) I'm fairly sure you'll find a few to love here.
There is a casual feeling about the writing which worked really well and as I said back up there there is a beautifully quirky sense to each and every one.Yes.
This is a wonderful collection of short stories. Some are whimsical, some nostalgic, some have more depth but they are all one thing, smart. I would be angry at the amount of Tom Hank's talent if he didn't seem like such a nice guy. Even if you don't care for short stories, pick this book up and savor it.
Maybe you have to love both Tom Hanks and typewriters to love these short stories, which are so tepid and inoffensive that they disappear from your mind even as you are reading them. They aren't bad, but there is nothing memorable here. I do not have typewriter nostalgia and while I like Mr. Hanks I think he's lucky he is famous or this collection would not have been published. For me, this book was pretty much a waste of time. The author generally did a good job narrating the audio book.
I was kind of “meh” with this book. It’s a collection of short stories written by Tom Hanks. A typewriter is a common motif throughout the stories. It’s not a challenging read by any means. However, the stories are not particularly engaging or captivating.

I love short stories. And Tom Hanks. So, short stories by Tom Hanks? I was super happy to have won this book in a Goodreads giveaway! The stories were good. Not excellent, but fun enough. My favorite ones were by the end of the book:-The past is important to us-Stay with us-Go see Costas-Steve Wong is perfect
When I found out he was narrating the audiobook, I couldn't buy those extra audible credits fast enough.
But while Hanks is an incredible actor and narrator, his stories are kind of vanilla.The writing reminds me of books written in the mid-20th century.
I found myself having to go back to the beginning of stories because it just couldn't keep my attention.
I think at some point I will try reading this again with the hard copy, but for now I stand by my rating.
Every story is expertly crafted. I would add a subtitle to this book: The Typewriter Chronicles. I just love how Tom sneaks in a typewriter somewhere in the story, even for just a moment in some, others as an important object. As I listened to each story I carefully and excitedly waited for the typewriter cameo! (I promptly ordered a book about old typewriters from Amazon as I was reading this book.)See what you made me do Tom! Seriously, great, unique stories by a creative and talented guy we all love.
This was such an entertaining and interesting story, or collection of stories. I really enjoyed listening for the common threads in each story and getting to know each character. A perfectly perfect book!
We all know what an amazing actor Tom Hanks is but to discover the dude is an amazing writer, too is an abundance of riches. This book is a collection of short stories that are well done with excellent characters. I listened to the audio read by the author. I highly recommend it!
Cannot wait for this!
Each story contains a reference to a typewriter, which truthfully I may have missed had it not been for the collection's title and jacket design and the fact that I’ve read that Tom is apparently obsessed with them.
The typewriters are clues that each story is grounded in nostalgia, whether for old-timey expressions (Hanks's characters are prone to use phrases like, "Howdy do?" and "Ah, heck"), or old-timey storytelling (newspaper column interludes are interspersed through the book, written with an small-time "ace" reporter's cadence).
If you, like me, admire Hanks's mastery on the big screen, it's not a leap at all to imagine you'll love him just as much on the page.Read more at https://www.bookofthemonth.com/uncomm...
I really enjoyed reading these short stories.Tom Hanks strikes me as an affable fellow, and his writing is the same.
I enjoyed the diversity of the stories and writing styles, from the straightforward first person narrative, to the newspaper columns, to the screen play.
I’m a sucker for this sort of thought pattern, and I read this story twice."Who’s Who" The reality of taking a bite out of the Big Apple not being as easy as it seems, not matter how hard working you are.
