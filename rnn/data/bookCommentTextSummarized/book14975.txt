Who will fall to Cujo before the disease he carries finishes him off?I'm just going to come out and say it.
While I didn't care about a lot of things on the periphery, the core of it is pretty terrifying and heart-wrenching.
No one wants their beloved family pet to turn on them and a rabid dog trapping a woman and her child in a car for DAYS is damn horrifying.
It was like being kicked in the balls after you're already lying on the ground after being shot in the heart.While I found that there was a lot of fat on this bone, it was pretty good at the core.
The first time I read this book was after having watched the movie.
Many times, characters in the book refer to Cujo as more than just a sick dog.
A monster that is active in Castle Rock during the time Pennywise is supposedly asleep in Derry.
Debunk in the comment section below.Notable names:George Bannerman, Johnny Smith, and Frank Dodd (The Dead Zone)Castle Rock (mentioned throughout the King-verse)In summation: If you read Cujo and are not in some way affected by the goings-down in the this book, I don't want to know you because you're an emotional cripple.
Oh, and this is the last time I'm reading this book.
Writing a review about Cujo is a little like reminiscing about being a teenager and listening to Black Sabbath.
Trying to describe it, and to put the experience in words, reveals the cartoonish elements in stark relief.
But while being read, the novel is rich with storytelling and more complex than would seem on it's surface.
And like the best of Sabbath: It rocks.Yes, it's about a town that gets eaten by a big, rabid dog, but King is able, and with some credibility, to tell a tale of modern paranoia and suspense, with elements of horror that are all too believable to a modern audience.

I'm guessing that many of you own or have owned a dog at some point in your life.
And, i'm also guessing that you'd consider said dog to be loyal to you and part of your family.
His brain would melt and with that he'd forget about you.
Forget the loyalty and love he held for you.He'd feel intense pain.In his eyes YOU would become the reason that he feels this pain.Mix this with a claustrophobic seige over a few days, some marital issues, a child that suffers from sleepless nights and you have Cujo.King really doesn't hold back any punches with this.
The monster never dies.4.5Cujo was a book I thought I was going to like, but not be scared of it (I mean, how scary can a rabid dog be, really?), but boy was I wrong with the second statement!
The problem was that the hole was filled with rabid bats, and one of them scratched Cujo.
It begins on page one, with Frank Dodd, but because I don't want to spoil anyone I will not say anything more about that, except that I wished that King focused on that aspect of the story a bit more since those parts scared me the most.
Iz neobjašnjivih razloga dugo sam želela da pročitam ovu knjigu i ispostavilo se da će mi ona biti među omiljenim Kingovim pričama.Opisi likova i radnje, tačnije apsolutno svega što se dešava čine da sve teče toliko sporo da se u jednom trenutku zapitate zašto i čemu sve to.
Ono što me je možda oduševilo više od svega jeste to što ova priča zapravo ima kraj.(view spoiler)[ Tokom čitanja sam se toliko emotivno investirala u to da li će Dona i Tedi Trenton uspeti da se izbore sa pobesnelim Kudžom kao i u to da li će Vik uopšte stići do njih da me je rasplet pogodio kao brzi voz i potpuno razneo.
"Cujo" was written during a time in which Stephen King was doing drugs, and it was exactly for that reason that I wanted to read it.Cujo is a cute, however big, St. Bernhards dog, who one day gets bitten by a rabid bat.
This incidence turns Cujo into monster who longs for food and no one can feel safe around this formerly beloved dog.
I think that if you have a fear of rabid animals, this book will certainly hit you.
To me personally, it wasn't the scariest book I've ever read, but it definitely contains some chapters and (car) scenes which will stick to my mind.
Steve the tennis pro does not take to the break-up very well and adds much more drama that could cost Tad and Donna their lives (or looking at it with an ironic twist possibly save them, because his actions bring Vic running home from his important meeting in New York...) The second family include blue collar Joe and Charity Chambers, and their son Brett--and oh boy, do they face a household of demons as well; including alcoholism, spousal abuse and child abuse....and (most important to this story) neglect of the family dog, especially when it comes to the vet.The first half of this book is spent excellently developing the characters (including an superb job with Cujo).
Goddammit!! This is currently on offer: £1.99p in the UK, $1.99 in the US (I think - it's showing as $2.68 - probably because of the exchange rate). It's the same price for: Lisey's Story, Insomnia, 11.22.63 and Hearts in Atlantis, too!
I thought maybe though you'd like more.I hate it.
You like being depressed?
If you are the kind of person who says that novels should reflect all the pain of real life and more...then this may be the book for you.Some great books concern pain, some wonderful novels require pain to be what they are...this one revels in pain and suffering and like de Sade seems to enjoy pain for pain's sake.
This is one of them...Did I make it clear, I hate this book???7/26/18: I reviewed this some time back.
He kills Brett's abusive father Joe and their neighbour Gary, and is awaiting an agonising death as Donna and Tad drive into Joe's garage to fix the car's starting problem.What happens next is what the novel is about - the stalled car, the woman and child trapped inside, the rabid dog outside - and the steadily mounting suspense culminating in a shattering climax.--------------------------------------------------------Cujo is much more disturbing than The Shining because of two things - one, the horror follows you after you leave the book and two, because the horror is very much in the real world.
Dodd has become something of a bogeyman used to scare children into behaving and a fear the adults in town would like to forget.I love all of King’s work (not equally!) but have always felt his novels that do not contain a supernatural element make the best movies.
King’s hints in this direction are not crucial to the story, but they certainly add a scary element as you read.King has said, on several occasions, that he wrote this novel at the height of his alcoholism and addiction and it shows.
Te dije que se irían, Tad, le susurró. Siempre lo hacen al final. Y entonces yo puedo volver. Me gusta volver. Tú me gustas, Tad. Ahora volveré todas las noches, creo, y todas las noches me acercaré un poco más a tu cama... y un poco más... hasta que una noche, antes de que puedas llamarles a gritos, oirás algo rugiendo, algo rugiendo justo a tu lado, Tad, y seré yo y me abalanzaré sobre ti y entonces te comeré y estarás en mí. Alguien me puede decir ¿qué era lo que había en el armario de Tad?
Tú me gustas, Tad. Ahora volveré todas las noches, creo, y todas las noches me acercaré un poco más a tu cama...
, para que después te des cuenta hasta qué punto se cumple la ley de Muphy y todo lo que puede salir mal, saldrá mal, hasta llevar a los personajes a la situación catastrófica, e insalvable de enfrentarse a un bestia peluda de más de 100 kilos con rabia.Ahora, de vuelta a lo importante, ALGUIEN ME PUEDE DECIR ¿QUÉ ERA LO QUE HABÍA EN EL ARMARIO DE TAD?
Cujo gets bitten by a rabid bat and the big friendly lovable Saint Bernard turns into a murderous beast. I really enjoyed this one a lot. I loved that Cujo's point of view was included. I couldn't help but feel for Cujo with all that happened to him due to circumstances beyond his control. I liked the small town setting of Castle Rock, Maine. The story was very atmospheric with an underlying tone of dread and apprehension throughout. Exciting, engrossing, bleak, sad, and very enjoyable.
What a scary book. A lovely furry cuddly St. Bernard. Everybody loves the St. Bernard. It is a life saver of a breed. So was Cujo. Until he developed Rabies. The rest is a frightening tale. A good film too starring Dee Wallace.🐯👍
I really liked this story but I didn't think it was as good as Pet Semetery. Most Stephen King books have great audiobook readers but the woman who read this one wasn't very appropriate for the book. She is an old woman that sounded like a witch. If this book was about old people or witches she may have fit in but it wasn't about either so it did work. Story ****Audiobook**Overall ***
All hail the King.Since giving Empire Falls five huge stars back in March, I have had seven, count 'em, SEVEN DNFs out of the past 10 books I've started since then.This was really starting to worry me.
Now, Cujo is no Empire Falls, we're talking apples and oranges here, but from a sheer entertainment standpoint it was just what the doctor ordered.
Wow.Cujo easily gets five out of five stars for pulling me out of one mire of a reading slump, and for being a hell of a good, suspensful and scary story.
They always end up paying for those mistakes in King's world.This is classic King: creepy, sick, raunchy, with sex and expletives sprinkled throughout.
Everyone knows the plot of this, but I was actually surprised by things I had forgotten about, mainly the ending.
I did not remember the ending being quite that dark.
(hide spoiler)]There isn't a whole lot of variety or subplots in this one.
I feel the plot was stretched pretty thin.
But still a classic, and a quick, easy read.Bad Cujo!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
ohhhhh....myyyy...goooood...πραγματικος , ατοφιος τρομος και αγωνια στο κατακορυφο !!! #woof
El libro nos crea un ambiente único, como mejor lo sabe hacer S.K. nos presenta el pueblo de Castle Rock, sus habitantes mas icónicos y a los protagonistas principales, la familia Camber, Trenton y a nuestro inolvidable y entrañable Cujo, un San Bernardo de cien kilos.En ningun momento el libro me resultó aburrido, lento o con páginas de relleno.
Sin dudas, Cujo se posicionó hasta el momento en el mejor libro que leí de Stephen King (obviamente después de la torre oscura), pero se ganó su merecidisimo segundo puesto, superando a libros como Cementerio de Animales, Dolores Claiborne, Apocalipsis o Christine.
After perusing a forum in which people ranked their top ten favorite King books, and noting that Cujo featured on quite a lot of them, I decided to give it a go.And I was blown away.Not only that, but I also rank it in my top ten favorite Stephen King novels.And here’s why:Admittedly, I went in expecting the tale of a killer dog, a rather simple (and in other hands, cheesy) premise that I knew would be elevated by King’s wonderfully comfortable voice, sense of place, and deftness of character.
I loved that.Although Cujo had one of my favorite endings of all King's novels I've read so far, its slow pace and brutal switches between some deep horror scenes to lighter ones - which sometimes disturbed the intensity of the narrative - made me knock off a star.(I don't think I can actually rate this book fairly, because it probably deserved 4,5 stars, but the most important is that I loved it.
Damn this is not what everyone said it would be!
I appreciate good suspense, but trust me, after 50 pages in that frickin' car, you get pretty bored.It started out awesomely, with Cujo getting bit and going slowly rabid.
He kills a few, and then I said, "Yes!
Here comes the good part!" but that was the end of the good part.
It became such a boring book, it was hard to get through.The sideplots were lacking, especially the cereal crap.
I was sick of business.
Where's the suspense?
I could've picked up the Wall Street Journal to read about business!
Ακόμα κι έτσι όμως, δεν θα έλεγα πως το Cujo είναι ένα αντιπροσωπευτικό βιβλίο του.
(Αλήθεια, μετά από «Το Κοράκι» τι καλύτερο μπορεί να περιμένει κανείς?)Η ιστορία σε γενικές γραμμές είναι μικρή και δεν εξαπλώνεται πολύ.
Προσωπικά κάθε σκηνή (view spoiler)[με την Donna και τον Tad στο αυτοκίνητο μου ανέβαζε την αδρεναλίνη καθώς ήταν γραμμένη πολύ έντεχνα και μπορεί να σε βάλει κι εσένα σε μία θέση του αυτοκινήτου προσπαθώντας να ξεφύγεις από τον Cujo.
(hide spoiler)]Το βιβλίο μου άρεσε και η ανάγνωση κυλούσε πολύ γρήγορα και ευχάριστα αλλά δεν θα έλεγα πως έμεινα τελείως ικανοποιημένος.
از اون دسته کتاب هایی بود که موقع خوندنش کلی آدرنالین ترشح می کنید. در کل کتاب خوبی بود....حاشیه زیاد داشت ولی انقدری نبود که حوصله تون رو سر ببره بلکه بیشتر مشتاقتون می کرد که ببینید قراره بعدش چه اتفاقی بیوفته. توصیه میکنم که اگر مثل من یه مقدار ترسو و خیالاتی هستین این کتاب رو قبل از خواب مطالعه نکنید که بعدش تا صبح 20 بار از خواب بپرید و به خودتون و نویسنده ی کتاب لعنت بفرستید :دی
Horror comes from the mundane; because all of the main characters happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, the events of the novel are allowed to happen.
He wants the reader to feel frustrated, exasperated -- just like the characters in the novel.
The characters are frustrated by simple fate, and I think King wanted the reader to feel their pain .
I think King was totally in on the seemingly mechanical (or forced, if you prefer) way the plot is pushed forward.Another criticism I often hear about this novel is the detail given to the subplots -- especially the one involving Charity and Brett's trip to Connecticut.
“The world was full of monsters, and they were all allowed to bite the innocent and the unwary”   Who doesn't love dogs? Loyal, innocent , silly little balls of fluff. But what happens when a dog goes rabid? What happens when the loyal loving dog you've known for years turns into a lethal killing machine with revenge on its mind?Cujo is the loving loyal, but gigantic saint bernard owned by the Chambers, Brett, Charity and Joe. When the Trenton family first meet the Chambers, Cujo is a friendly
Worst of all, with her husband away on business Mrs Trenton and her son Tad are on their way to drop their nearly broken down car off at the Chambers property, unaware of the danger that resides there or what has happened to the once friendly dog, Cujo things are about to take a turn for the worst, and a mother will stop at nothing to protect herself and her young son.I've been interested in reading this for awhile,and Stephen King has a knack for writing either a hit or a miss when it comes to his novels.
We get insight into Cujo's owners, the Cambers family (Joe and Charity, and their son Brett) and their messed up dynamic.
Not going to lie.We also follow the Trenton family (Vic and Donna) who are newcomers to the area, who are raising their four year old son Tad. We get hints that something is up with Donna fairly early on, but then we dive into it more fully and find out that Donna has been having an affair with Steve Kemp.
I think King did a good job of balancing what was going on with Cujo and others in this story.
