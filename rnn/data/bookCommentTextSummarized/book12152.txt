This album, first published in 1968, is unusual in the Tintin series for its science fiction and paranormal influences.

Tintin is kidnapped by his Arch-nemesis26 February 2012 I used to love this one as a kid because it had lots of machine guns in it. However, since I have returned to reading the Tintin books so that I know what I am writing about (as opposed to some books that I am not really interested in rereading, namely because they are too long and that there are other books out there that I would rather spend my time reading) I have no longer appreciate this album as much as some of Herge's other stories.
Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are on their way to Australia to an aeronautical conference, namely because they were the first people on the moon (though I note that the Thompsons weren't included, though with the number of protagonists that appear in this book, having a couple of extra clumsy characters may have been a bit too difficult, and the Thompsons are probably becoming a little overused by now).
Rastapopoulos has now rejoined the ranks of the ordinary people, and being impatient (as a lot of antagonists are) has decided that he will go a quick way to becoming uber-rich again, rather than the slow way, so he decided to kidnap Carreidas and force him to reveal the location of a hidden stash of money.
My review, as published at Tintin Books:For a man who has been criticised (fairly or not) for sexism, padding of stories and racism to (among others) Africans, Jews, Native Americans, Japanese, Russians and Indians, it's amusing to think that his most controversial work amongst fans is probably "Flight 714", the penultimate completed adventure in the series.
But, on re-reading, you can count me amongst those who think it was probably one big mistake."Flight 714" starts off strongly enough, with the first 12 pages devoted to something Herge had perfected in The Castafiore Emerald - comedies of manners featuring the main characters and others bound to annoy them - but combining it with that genuine sense of unease and discord which underlies all of his best works.

كل اللى اقدر اقولهولكم انى كنت باهرب بعد الفسحه من الحصص و اتدارى فى المكتبة عشان اقرا تان تان دا :)))))
It feels like cheating to put tintin stories onto my reads for the year, but since this was the Spanish version, it seems fair enough - an easy start perhaps but my first completed book in Spanish!
But with a comic book, the visuals help maintain focus and are of course part of the humour.
And with comics, it can be tempting to cheat by skimming the dialogue and just looking at the pictures.
Has it helped my Spanish?
But since I was young, Tintin has always been a fun read and I don't recall reading this before despite the Australian reference, and this was no different.
funny, entertaining, made me laugh

It's fun to see the recurring baddies - Allan and Rastapopolous, and see how Herge ultimately humiliates them.
It gives the story another layer, another element, a face to the common man who is reading the story at that moment.Or when Rastapopolous and the other scoundrels find Carreidas' hat.
While the other character's are busy talking, we the reader get to see the plant's unfortunate end.This is a jewel in the world of Tintin.
The characters give the story life, color, and humor; the setting gives a sense of adventure; and the plot with it's flying saucer is out of the box and before it's time, yet wonderfully done and fully believable.
Our friends Tintin and Captain Haddock with Professor Calculus are traveling to Sydney, but as usually they get in trouble and they find themselves prisoners of their old enemy Mr. Rastapopoulos on an Indonesian island. This issue has a bit of science fiction and paranormal influences and even promotes the idea of communication between the extra-terrestrial and the humans. The central mystery is essentially left unresolved. Poor Snow, in this issue it fell in a lake with turbulent waters and was saved the last minute by Tintin!
In this adventure Tintin and Captain Haddock meet again their old enemy Rastapopoulos! The adventure - which starts with a seemingly innocuous plane trip, ends up being one of the most defying ones in terms of fights and counter coups...Maria Carmo,Lisbon 20 January 2015.
3.5/5I love Tintin.
This one isn't one of my top faves, but I still love reading it.
I read Tintin every once-in-a-while because they're fast reads, they make me laugh, and are about adventure.
I appreciate the inclusion of aeroplane dynamics in this one, and Lazlo's love for his hat is funny as always.
Cuthbert would annoy me in real life, but he adds some spark to the comics so of course I love him.
I don't really know what else to say except that if you're looking for some light, adventure reading, and love a good comic, Tintin is definitely something you should check out.
با اينكه هيچ هيجان و فلانى نداشت و شخصيتاى دوست نداشتنى اى برگشته بودن، اما پايانش اونقدرى بامزه بود كه سه بدم بش :-"
Mir persönlich gefallen sie sehr, und, wenn "Vol 714" auch bei weitem nicht so gut ist wie das brillante Les bijoux de la Castafiore, hat dieser Band doch einige Qualitäten, die ich loben will.Hergé baute immer wieder gern mehr oder weniger aktuelles Zeitgeschehen in seine Werke ein, sei es der sino-japanische Konflikt, Sklavenhandel oder, wie hier, der damalige Hype um die Erde besuchende extraterrestrische Lebensformen, den hauptsächlich Erich von Däniken kurz vor Entstehung des Bands lostrat.
Doch das lockert den Band sehr auf, und er enthält dementsprechend auch die Stelle, an der ich auch bei der inzwischen mindestens 5.
The alien messenger radios to him not to risk himself for another, and though we don't hear Tintin's reply, it's clear from the reaction it causes that it's something like 'You go to Hell!' (hide spoiler)]This is great because it's the kind of thing that the upright character of Tintin would never say aloud, but when his friends are in danger he unflinchingly takes action regardless of risk to himself.
To Tintin he and his friends are bonded, he doesn't even consider the possibility of not leaping into action for their defense.
People always say characters that don't change aren't interesting, but Tintin offers a counterargument to that narrative.
Darker than most of Tintin's adventures, but it fares better than The Castafiore Emerald and Tintin and the Picaros, both of which have less the spark of the earlier stories.
Truly, Carreidas is a great character, who's sliminess benefits from a slow reveal, until suddenly, under the spell of a truth serum, he and the villain of the story are literally fighting for the mantle of the worst man alive.Herge's art is in fine form as usual, and his writing has never been better.
The slapstick of the series is in rare form, and as the story comes to an end it shakes Tintin out of his usual heroic dynamic.
what a lot of evily ingenious plots but they are surely not going to work when Tintin is in them. unless they are his!.....this book also has a come back of a old friend read the book to find out! Hmmm how many times have I read this??? You just cant get enough of Tintin! He never fails to please.
اولين كتاب تن تن ى كه خوندم، و ديگه ول نكردم :)
I loved this one, very close call! I love Herge's colors, they're so vivid.
Funny!
This was the last book i read and found out it is not bad at first you dont enjoy but after some while it became more enjoyable cool book
Futuristic, really well drawn, the story was great, really good intro and character presentation, not predictable at all.******SPOILERS**************SPOILERS**************SPOILERS**************SPOILERS********Aliens!
At the end you see an UFO but that about it.The way the story is presented to the reader was really well done.
It all starts with Tintin and his friends, traveling to Sidney.
As usual our heros escape, gets recaptured, escape again and in the middle of everything Tintin starts to hear voices in his head.
Then the story gets more interesting and ends with Tintin and co.
It starts like pretty much any Tintin book, but it's tone and plot is closer to the weirdest books in the series...
and I think this works well!How is it any different than the other books in the series?
Well, it has mora action than most Tintin books, and the type of action is a bit different too - we get things like gunfights, explosions and chases.
There are also many mythical and extra-terrestrial elements here.A great book, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a bit divisive for fans - it's plot takes more than a couple weird turns.
Questo è il primo fumetto di Hergé che leggo (in lingua originale🇧🇪-🇫🇷) e mi è sembrato molto simile a tutte le altre avventure del giornalista Tintin. Infatti dopo aver visto la prima stagione dei cartoni animati dello stesso fumetto, ripeto che alla fine le peripezie e i complotti sono sempre quelli e seguono lo stesso schema. I disegni comunque sono bellissimi e i personaggi sono ben caratterizzati.
This album mixes crime with the supernatural. We meet some old friends (view spoiler)[and Rastapopoulos, who seems to be ridiculed in this instalment of the series (hide spoiler)].There are a few winks to earlier albums (the band-aid, Tournesol risking to go berserk when Haddock asks him if he could stop "faire le zouave") and the settings were atmospheric, but the album wasn't that convincing to me.The airplane has been designed by Roger Leloup who later started his own comic series, Yoko Tsuno.
Tintin's adventures are pure fun. There's always action, adventure, and humor. These comics definitely have an Indiana Jones feel to them - though they predate those movies by several decades. I love the friendship between Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus. I also like that other characters from previous comics make appearances in this one. I did miss Thompson and Thomson though. They're probably the funniest. A very enjoyable adventure.
As the first Tintin to read ever, I think it's ok, can't judge by comparing it to other comics, since I'm not a big comics fan. For me it's a little long for a comic, had to read it on 3 shots because I couldn't complete it on one shot. But it has some funny instances here and there. but I don't think I'll pursue another Tintin in the near future.
Part 22 of my big re-read of the whole Tintin-canon after decades ...I had not read this one before, .This is the usual type of Tintin-adventure involving a journey, villains, a jailbreak - except ... for the very weird scene (view spoiler)[with the UFO !! (hide spoiler)] towards the end.Verdict: Okay.
Tintin is an absolute joy to read. It transcends the comic book genre to become something much more cultural, relevant, witty and a breath of fresh air for troubling times. The art style is immediately recognizable and has the mark of a true artist in the form of Hergé. The entire series is something everyone should get their hands on and devour over a weekend and a cup of tea.
Flight 714 is definitely a very good Tintin adventure. Though not as exciting as the Black Island, and not as peculiar as the Shooting Star, 714 finds a nice middle ground, starting as a hijackers adventure comic book, and ending with literal alien abductions. If not for Rastapopoulos as the villain, the escapade would not have been as memorable. 4/5
