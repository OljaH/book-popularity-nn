It is interesting how Delphi has multiple errors like in Ann Radcliffe's collection that I recently read and other not remembering having any, which is the case here.
I have read three books and will continue to read his works here and hope they correct other author collections where it is needed.
If you want to see the reviews of the ones I have read, they are located under the title or click on the author tag above to see my shelf of that author, those who are interested.
I read a lot of Delphi works because of cost and knowing they get the full story.
In the novels, I must admit, I skipped most hunting scenes and a lot of parliamentary debates.
But I read all the novels and story collections faithfully.Trollope is not for our day, but if you are interested in the ambiance and mores of 19-th century England, he is your guy.
He has remarkable sensibility for the helpless status of women, and as a result has a number of strong female characters.
On the topic of Jews, you can read all the disdain that was prevalent against Jews, and few Jewish characters are full-fledged human beings.
But there is the novel Nina Balatka to balance all that.
Brilliant writer, much undervalued in my opinion. What's particularly appealing about A T is that his female characters are strong: Alice Vavasor, her cousin Glencora Palliser, and her aunt Arabella Greenow to name but three. He also has an interesting take on the political landscape of the time.
