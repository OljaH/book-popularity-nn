⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐! It Happened One Autumn (stand-alone). Marcus Marsden, Lord Westcliff meets his match in the feisty American heiress, Lillian Bowman!   “It has all the makings of a farce.

4 Hate/Love Stars******Spoilers***** It Happened One Autumn was a good read but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I was really looking forward to Lillian's book. I loved her brash, foul mouthed, outspoken american ways. I couldn't wait for her to bring Westcliff to his knees.

It Happened One Autumn was a good read but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.
I was really looking forward to Lillian's book.
So I was a little disappointed that for half the book Westcliff fought his attraction to Lillian.
I also didn't like that Lord St. Vincent was trying to court her or that they kissed.
I wanted Westcliff to go after her like Simon from book one went after his wife!
I did like Westcliff and loved Lillian.
I am still looking forward to his book with Evie.
Just not as good as I expected.
I'm not sure I can come up with enough superlatives for this one, the second book in Lisa Kleypas's magical Wallflowers series.
Ahh, but LK did a 180 with his character, giving us his whole backstory (including brutal childhood), and I got to understand him, and fall in love with him right along with the heroine, American soap heiress Lillian Bowman.Now, Lillian--I loved this girl despite (or maybe because) she was so opinionated, headstrong, irreverent, stubborn, sharp-tongued, funny,--and she took no guff from the button-downed, often arrogant Westcliff.
I think this book is my favorite in the series so far (yes, I have read Devil in Winter already).
This book is the story of Lillian and Westcliff, a brash and outspoken American and a formal, follow the rules Englishmen.
Do you have some sort of lubricant nearby?""No.""Not anything?""Much as it may surprise you, we've never needed lubricant in the library before now.”  I'm not normally one for historical romance, but Lisa Kleypas has that magic about her writing.
It's an amazing escape from reality, a foray into the lives and loves of the past.I'm also going to add, when Lillian and Westcliff do finally give in, BOOM WENT THE OVARIES!
FOUR POINT FIVE STARSTHE HUSBAND HUNTERS ARE BACK!In London (1843) a pact is made between 4 wallflowers.
She's a rich American who comes off a little more wild and free than her English counterparts.Then we have FOREVER and lifetime bachelor, Marcus, Lord Westcliff.
Any time Marcus gets within a close distance to Lillian his animal magnetism goes wild for her.Towards the end of the book there's a little plot twist that I didn't see coming which made for a fun adventure.
Can be read as standalones but it's recommended reading the series in order.Novella:
So they band together, and a daring husband-hunting scheme is born.It Happened One Autumn follows the second Wallflower, the bold and shockingly opinionated Lillian Bowman, whose crude manners, American origins and nouveau riche status complicate her attempts to find a noble husband in English society.
Her improper comments and attitude are met with contempt, but no one is more annoyed at her stubborness and inability to act like a delicate young woman than Lord Westcliff, an overbearing and controlling nobleman who happens to be the most eligible bachelor.
And just for fun and laughs, I had to capture the hilarious scene between the wallflower gals discussing, or perhaps more accurately, vehemently dismissing, Evie’s rather portly cousin Eustace being her one and only marital prospect.“Wait a minute,” Daisy said suspiciously, coming to Lillian’s side.
“He was the one who broke the chair, wasn’t he, Evie?”Evie confirmed Daisy’s question with an inarticulate murmur.“Good God!” Lillian exclaimed, “you are not considering marrying him, Evie!”Annabelle wore a puzzled expression.
Did he throw it?”“He broke it by sitting on it,” Lillian said with a scowl.“Cousin Eustace is rather l-large boned,” Evie admitted.
Another entertaining entry in the Wallflower series, all of which have been thoroughly enjoyable even if I did read them out of order!This time it is Lillian's turn to find herself a rich husband and she does it in style.
As in all the other books the dialogue is the thing- smart and funny and always entertaining.
The characters are well defined and as I am sure I have said before, probably many times, the overall atmosphere of the book is a la Georgette Heyer but with sex.
And this is not a bad thing.Sad that this series is finished but luckily Lisa Kleypas has written others!
When they get together they bring out the worst in each other, but they also bring out the best in one another.OK, I just want to say that there are 2 scenes that stand out in my mind and both made me laugh.
Don't deny it, if you've read this book, you laughed.
And the other scene was where Annabelle, having come down to breakfast with dark circles under her eyes and looking as though she hadn't slept at all during the night (because she hadn't) was trying to delicately explain to Lillian, Evie and Daisy the effect that a certain perfume had had on Simon, her husband, who needed no potion to influence or increase his sexual...
3,5 Stars One thing's for sure: Westcliff, the hero, has much more patience for ill-mannered houseguests than I do. The houseguest in question being the heroine, Miss Lillian Bowman. The brash American heiress and the starchy English earl, so much potential especially in the hand of such a skilled author, and in fact, for the greater part the book delivered on all accounts and I enjoyed most of their scenes together immensely. If only Lillian had been a little less confrontational. I understand
One thing's for sure: Westcliff, the hero, has much more patience for ill-mannered houseguests than I do.
The houseguest in question being the heroine, Miss Lillian Bowman.
If only Lillian had been a little less confrontational.
And Westcliff, now he was a dear and sexy one.It also was nice to meet once again the Wallflowers and the other cast of characters and follow their further interactions which, as I've already found in book 1 Secrets of a Summer Night, were some of the best fun.
Updated review 27/3/16 after third read!This is one of the funniest historical romances I have read and I laughed out loud so many times.
The Wallflower series is one of the most wonderful historical romance series out there!
Lillian is a wonderful strong, brazen, independent, American heroine and I really liked the hate-love relationship between her and Marcus.
On my previous reads I have missed a well-developed emotional bond between Westcliff and Lillian; however, that was not the case this time around.
Maybe third time really is a charm.
Maybe Westcliff is not my type of guy but he is definitely perfect for Lillian.
"I can't get it out," she said."Just pull at it.""It hurts. It's throbbing.""Pull harder.""I can't! It's truly stuck. I need something to make it slippery. Do you have some sort of lubricant nearby?""No.""Not anything?""Much as it may surprise you, we've never needed lubricant in the library before now." And that, yes that, is why I continue to read books like this.
I really enjoyed this story and I firmly believe that Lillian and Westcliff are soulmates.
Lillian is very forward thinking, and would never fit into the mold of a well-bred, quiet, English lady.
Westcliff thinks that's exactly what he wants if he marries.
I enjoyed the way Lillian needled him.
There is no question about the strong attraction between Lillian and Westcliff, and it drives this book towards its inevitable conclusion.In this story, my favorite hero, St. Vincent, is more of a villain.
I think it's because Westcliff and Lillian are very abrasive characters who I love in small doses, but can overwhelm me in large doses.
Those blasted feelings won't leave.Marcus fought a valiant battle but love...and Lillian, were the winners.One of the most unlikely couples to ever fall in love, in the end, they were a perfect match for each other.
If you haven't read this series and thinking of trying out historical romance, I definitely recommend.The audio was amazing and I think Rosalyn Landor is my go-to narrator for Historical Romance.
I never struggle with telling the characters apart.I will definitely be going on in the series and with that ending, I think it will be sooner rather than later.No change in my rating as I loved the audio as much as reading It Happened One Autumn.
Se sabe el final desde el principio, pero da igual... Si es que aún sabiéndolo todo, engancha!!!La parte final me ha dejado boquiabierta, ¡no me imagino la próxima pareja!!!!!! Un reto enorme el de Kleypas el hacernos cambiar de opinión sobre Vincent, teniendo en cuanta lo mal que "lo ha puesto" en este libro. Inevitablemente, continúo con el siguiente.
«No hay nada en este mundo más hermoso que tu sonrisa...
ni sonido más dulce que el de tu risa...
No hay mayor placer que poder rodearte con mis brazos.
Hoy me he dado cuenta de que no podré vivir sin ti, por muy testaruda y alborotadora que seas.
Eres mi única esperanza de felicidad, tanto en esta vida como en la siguiente.
Dime, Lillian, amor mío...
¿cómo es posible que te hayas colado en lo más profundo de mi corazón?»Lo que adoré a estos personajes, lo que me divertí y lo que disfruté con esta historia, ¡no tiene nombre!
★4.5★ "I've wanted you every moment since I first held you in my arms." It Happened One Autumn is the second book in the Wallflowers Series. Relatively new to Historical Romance, I have discovered Lisa Kleypas to be one of my new favorite go-to authors. The Wallflowers features four young ladies living in London as they try to secure happiness and love. In this second book, we are introduced to the spunky American Lillian Bowman and the noble aristocrat Lord Marcus Westcliff. Lillian and her fam
It Happened One Autumn is the second book in the Wallflowers Series.
In this second book, we are introduced to the spunky American Lillian Bowman and the noble aristocrat Lord Marcus Westcliff.
Marcus is quite wealthy and wants for nothing and Lillian is an unpolished, outspoken, American Girl just trying to find acceptance in society.
Lillian is not an ideal candidate for a bride for Lord Westcliff but they manage to fall head over heels in love with each other.
The supporting characters offer intrigue and humor as Marcus and Lillian discover the truth about their fate!
In the end, St. Vincent is sent back to his house and the next day Westcliff and Lillian set off for Gretna Green to get married.What to say about this book other than it's utterly and completely amazing...Hmmm...I loved the Wallflowers and seeing their dynamic.
I loved seeing him go from arrogant and "hating" Lillian to realizing just how much he cares for her and accepting that he needs her in his life.I adored Lillian and how stubborn she was in every instance, but I also enjoyed seeing her transform like Westcliff.
But this time around, after re-reading the series, I find myself having a totally deeper appreciation of the book, primarily because I saw how Marcus' character developed since the prequel.
And yes, she was frustrating and illogical with her refusal to marry Marcus despite of being thoroughly shagged by him.
Marry me, Lillian…because I have the most irresistible fascination for your ears.”While I am thoroughly convinced that Lillian and Marcus belonged to each other, I just couldn't help but feel bad at how Sebastian was treated here.
But I'm an intensely loyal fan of his and Evie's, and I couldn't help but cringe at some parts of this book.
I loved their immediate dislike of one other when they first met, and then their raging passion once they realized what it was they were really feeling.Their characters are so alike.
They're both strong-willed, confident, stubborn, intelligent, and extremely protective of the people they love.
They seem to truly bring out the best in one another.When Marcus finally gives in to his attraction to Lilly and decides he wants her in his life forever...
I was so happy that Marcus went after Lilly and extremely disappointed in his mother the Countess, and in Viscount St. Vincent (bad form Sebastian).
I love when two totally different people connect so perfectly
Four young ladies enter London society with one necessary goal: they must use their feminine wit and wiles to find a husband. So they band together, and a daring husband-hunting scheme is born. This book is another great addition to the highly entertaining wish-fulfilment romance that is the Wallflower series. What this series does so well is the female bonding/friendships. The wallflowers recognise a basic fact, that being a woman comes with certain disadvantages and loss of privileges men nev
Four young ladies enter London society with one necessary goal: they must use their feminine wit and wiles to find a husband.
This book is another great addition to the highly entertaining wish-fulfilment romance that is the Wallflower series.
What this series does so well is the female bonding/friendships.
It's great to see female characters who are well fleshed out, pragmatic and industrious.
Still, underneath all the light-hearted romance and entertainment, there's a message about hope, love, perseverance, true friendship and fighting prejudice and backward ways of thinking (within the scope of the groups aristocratic setting).
I loved the way that Lisa Kleypas made the book extremely dramatic yet hilarious at the same time and what I really loved about Lisa Kleypas’ writing is how she made Lillian Bowman and Marcus, Lord Westcliff’s relationship seem so hilarious, especially when they are arguing so much.
This romance novel is sex scenes galore as it is full of lovemaking scenes between Marcus and Lillian that will have your hairs stand on your ends!There are many sex scenes throughout this book, so anyone who is uncomfortable with reading sex scenes might want to skip over these scenes when reading this book.All in all, “It Happened One Autumn” is clearly a novel that defines what a true romance novel is all about and also features my favorite hero, Marcus, Lord Westcliff!
Another good read. Love to see the aristocracy brought to their knees by the lower classes! And by an American, no less.Marcus, Lord Westcliff is one of the most eligible bachelors in England. He knows it is his duty to marry well. Someone of his own station ... but he is attracted to a brash American girl. And he is not happy. He does not like her, he does not want to be attracted to her! And the feeling is mutual from her. And once he had passed judgment on someone, he rarely changed his opini

but he is attracted to a brash American girl.
He does not like her, he does not want to be attracted to her!
"I can hardly wait to see whom Westcliff ends up with.""I pity the poor girl," Lillian replied, "whoever she is."
"Westcliff is not my true love!
And any woman unlucky enough to marry him will end up rotting here in Hampshire, having to account to him for everything she does.
I don't think I can justify a higher rating with an ending like that 😕Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Lillian and Marcus's story.
It was actually a hate-to-love type relationship.H rating: 4 stars.
(hide spoiler)]Heat level: Hot. They have some hot tension, chemistry, and scenes -- but not so much it takes away from the story.Descriptive sex: YesOW/OM drama: Yes (view spoiler)[One of the H's friends pursues the h because he is in financial trouble and needs her fortune.
(hide spoiler)]Sex scene with OW or OM: NoCheating:  NoSeparation: Not in the relationship sense (view spoiler)[They are separated physically shortly, but there was no mention or suggestion of other partners during this time.
This series came to me at just the right time in my life, *sucky*, and has me smiling while I read. Thank you, Nicole!I think I liked this one slightly more than the first - if that's possible. And, it wasn't just because of the hero/heroine, it was the side characters. St. Vincent is sex-on-a-stick awesomeness wrapped in a dangerously beautiful burrito wrapper. One please!  I also loved seeing the married relationship between Simon and Annabelle. His devotion to her is adorable.In this story, w
St. Vincent is sex-on-a-stick awesomeness wrapped in a dangerously beautiful burrito wrapper.
His devotion to her is adorable.In this story, we have a little bit of a Darcy/Elizabeth relationship going on between Marcus and Lillian.
There is even this line about Marcus:
Sound familiar?Of course, loving Pride & Prejudice as much as I do, I loved this story.
It was fast, fun, funny, and romantic.Now, I'm ready for Lord St. Vincent's story because he is described as this:
St. Vincent possessed an exotic male beauty, his eyes pale blue and catlike, his mouth edged with cruelty even when he smiled.
*re-read September 30th 2013 -review to come :D **earlier reactions **It's time to re-read one of my ALL TIME fave historical novels!!!And the best way, is to buddy read with the Amazing Soraya :D Here I come Marcus!!!
Every time Westcliff glanced at her, touched her, smiled at her, it provoked a feeling that she had never known before. A painful feeling of yearning that made her want impossible things.  Lillian Bowman might be a wallflower, but she sure doesn’t act like one. I loved how headstrong she is, she’s passionate, opinionated and not shy at all. Her parents had brought her and her sister from America to England, hoping they could find husbands for their daughters, and hopefully they would be nobilit
But neither Lillian, nor Daisy are what the nobleman of England are used to, and I loved it.
They way Lillian challenged and clashed wills with the serious and imposing Lord Westcliff was awesome!!
Marcus, Lord Westcliff is used to being obeyed and in control.
I loved the intense animosity between them in the beginning, and how with every heated encounter their feelings for each other became more passionate, more undeniable.
And the way Marcus couldn’t stop losing control around Lillian, couldn’t keep his hands off her, was just wonderful.

Ay noo con frases como estás una muere de amor y solterona He decir que me gustó mucho más que el libro anterior Marcus un hombre estirado aparentemente duro y frío, se encuentra con la horma de su zapata, una chica, voluntariosa, con una lengua afilada acostumbrada a salirse con la suya, al igual que él es terca y testaruda y me encantó verlos a los dos ceder a sus encantos y atracción.Por cierto, me estoy haciendo la difícil y todavía no hay quien atrape mi corazón Marcus estuvo cerquita muy muy cerca.Estoy que me muero de ganas de leer el siguiente y es que a como se quedó, quiero saber como se redime Sebastián.
If a girl tells you to stop and is literally fighting against you, you should probablyyyyyyy stop kissing her. Just sayin'.Other than that, I'm having a lot of fun reading these and I'm absolutely loving the female friendships!
4.5 Stars!!!
