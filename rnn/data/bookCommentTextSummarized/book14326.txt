Ο Barker ορμάει μέσα στην ψυχή του αναγνώστη με όλη τη δύναμη της ελευθερίας των ανθρωπίνων συναισθημάτων και τα περιπλέκει με την τρομακτική του φαντασία.
Η Σουζάνα,που κληρονομεί απο την απόκοσμη γιαγιά της ένα τρομερό κειμήλιο και μια μεγάλη δύναμη (μενστρούουμ) κόντρα στους εχθρούς της μαγείας.
Εκτός απο την φρικτή Μάστιγα και τη δεισιδαιμονία των Μουρλών,οι Διοράτες κινδυνεύουν και απο κάποια φρικαλέα και σατανικά πλάσματα που τα έχουν εξοβελίσει απο τον κόσμο τους.
Ορίζουν φύλακες απο τον κόσμο των Μουρλών για να ξεδιπλώσουν το χαλί και να ζωντανέψει το παραμύθι τους όταν θα υπάρχει ασφάλεια.
Even the introduction is great, normally I skim through lengthy intros to get to the story, but Clive Barker puts his heart and soul into this one, including this beautiful passage about the genre fiction: “I have been, I think, altogether disparaging about the ‘escapist’ elements of the genre, emphasizing its powers to address social, moral and even philosophical issues at the expense of celebrating its dreamier virtues.
The storyline concerns two human protagonists who become involved with the Fugue and the Seerkind and their struggle against powerful enemies who are trying to destroy both.I first read Weaveworld around fifteen years ago and certain elements and scenes have stuck with me through all these years.
This book probably deserves a full analysis, going into a full and deep review mode that gives a grand majority of the characters, both good and evil, lots of time to explore ambitions and twists and character growths and failures.
I should also go into a twenty-page monologue on how beautiful and strange and wonderful the fantasy elements are, from the sideways-twisted tormenting of christian beliefs, the reimagining of so many mythical elements, the fact that good and evil are never what they seem and they often fly into each other's territories regardless of how the quasi-demons, quasi-fae, quasi-witches, or quasi-humans look or feel on the page.It's scary.
This is Clive Barker, after all.The world-building is truly amazing, and so is the deep reimagining of all magic.
I looked Barker up on Wiki, scanned the list of novels, and decided that yes Weaveworld must be the Barker that I read.Pretty sure I Liked the post, (ironic really) and left the comment below, that resulted in the rest of the exchange.= = = = = = = = = =Me: I think I read this many years ago.
An author from Liverpool is not to be scorned, and I see that he has become a very famous artist in different media.Ch: Ted, I am a stranger to Clive Barker, but your comment which I respect, caused me to read some reviews of this book on GR.
They were the Seerkind, and they were the magical children of the world.Then the Scourge came.
They used their best magics and their most exquisite raptures to weave their most precious places and people into a haven that no one would ever find, a place that no one would ever look.
With him, and supporting him is the Incantrantrix Immaculata, who hates the Seerkind with all her cold, dead heart.And somewhere, in a dry, empty place, the Scourge sleeps....I've read this book countless times, and it never gets old.
The names themselves are magical, and it makes it so much more wonderful.I cannot recommend this book enough.
Weaveworld wanders around a LOT in its 700+ Odysseus-like pages, but there’s something phantasmal and strange about this mystical world Clive Barker has created that just sucks me in.That being said, the long and complex Weaveworld isn’t pure science fiction or fantasy.
In the Old World tales, witches and wizards could sew up their corners or portions of the earth, making them invisible to others.In Weaveworld, a whole magical landscape has been sewn into a rug to guard it from humans and supernatural creatures that would destroy it.
After the disaster that was Imajica, I wasn’t sure I even wanted to continue with Barker at all.
I felt like he lost me completely with that book.
But then I remembered how much I loved the Thief of Always….and can we talk about the greatness that is the HellBound Heart?Imajica was so far over my head I thought that part of the book wasn’t in mine.
I was hoping that Weaveworld would rekindle my affection for Barker.
I felt like this one was a less confusing version Imajica.
Barker has created a world here- and it is contained in a carpet.
Briljantno, maštovito, originalno.
But when I hit about 450 I started reading it just to finish it.
I figured I only had 200 pages to go and I can read about 100 pages an hour or so, especially given the large title pages and etc in this book, but at night when I would go to read, I'd end up on Reddit instead, or I'd write something or I'd do cross stitch!
I have never done this before, but I skipped ahead and the read the last page, and then chucked the book over my bannister.
No, seriously. I really don't know what I've read and have no clue how to describe it in a coherent manner. Weaveworld is a story of a world within a world. A world that to save itself from destruction, wove itself into a magic carpet, if you will. It's the story of a world within a world within a world (yep, another one) that are all on a road to collision.  “Nothing ever begins.There is no first moment; no single word or place from which this or any other story springs.” The book is long, and
Weaveworld is a story of a world within a world.
It's the story of a world within a world within a world (yep, another one) that are all on a road to collision.
The book is long, and brain consuming.
It's not easy to read and at times may seem long winded.
The elements that make the book so good redeem it in the end.
Win.This book is one of those that comprises of a journey which may take some time to traverse, but it's worth it.Bunneh promise.
“For nothing ever begins.And this story, having no beginning, will have no end."
Complex, sensual, twisted.Also, very long. You need to have something for Fantasy to try this, otherwise go away.
This book is not for the faint of heart.
If you like weird, wonderful and grotesque imagery in your books, feel free to join us.
I love a good dark fantasy/horror novel and this one is one of the best...
It's filled with grotesque, bizzare, intense, unique, weird, titillating and magical imagery and I love everything about it.
Since I tend to read it every few years the copy I own is pretty tattered and the pages brown, even though I've had to buy it a few times (letting people "borrow" books can be hazardous).
In fact, you shouldn't even read other people's descriptions.
$2.99 on US Amazon April 6, 2018.721 pages... A little light reading...
There were moments as I read this fantasy about another world, woven into a carpet, peopled with magical characters, that the line between fascination and skepticism would begin to blur, and I would feel doubt.
I know, from looking at other reviews, that there is a lot of allusion, a lot of symbolism at play here, but when I'm just listening to a book, I tend to just let it wash over me without thinking of the deeper elements of the story.
I first read WEAVEWORLD back in the late '80s just after it came out, and did so while on a boat trip around the Chester area on the Shropshire Union canal, so it was an episodic reading experience, punctuated by working locks, taking in scenery, and visiting a huge number of pubs.
But I can't hope to reach Barker's flickering, glorious, raptures of body horror; that vision is his and his alone.I was sorely disappointed with Barker's SCARLET GOSPELS, but reading WEAVEWORLD again reminded me that, on his game, he's up there with the best.And this is one of the best.
This is a strange one to read.The edition I picked up is a hefty tome of a thing, 500+ thick, too-white (almost glossy) pages with bold red numbers, loosely scattered illustrations and loud chapter announcements.
Gorgeous, really, firmly and without question a book (sometimes they are so quiet and uncertain it's hard to tell).
There is a little too much discussion of odd sensations in various characters' "pricks and balls" - I'm not sure what the fixation was, really - but other than that Weaveworld a strangely enjoyable, even captivating read.
I don't remember how I came across the idea of reading this.
Barker lets loose his imagination as he takes you on an unforgettable trip to fantastic and incredible worlds of pure fantasy.
His writing style engrosses the reader deep within the pages, immersing you into a dark and wonderful land of the unbelievable.
He takes you on a trip of the magical and macabre and celebrates the potential of the human imagination.The novel will grip you from the start and keep you desperate to keep reading.
It is a book of dark fantasy that leaves you breathless after each page.
Divna priča, uvrnuta i strašna, uvuče čitaoca već nakon nekoliko stranica. Treća četvrtina, koja bi trebalo da je najdinamičnija, kao da je zbrzana malo i nepotrebno rasplinuta (ili je Barker bio na nečemu), ali onda ponovi hvata zamah.
It goes down in my life as one of the most memorable, intriguing, and stimulating books I have ever read.
A must-read for Barker fans, or anyone who likes cross-genre books (horror, fantasy, action).
Read below for my original review................The best thing about this book is that it is able to cross genres seamlessly.
With elements of fantasy, horror and science fiction, it has become my favorite "non-genre" that I will surely look for in other books.
It has the best elements of these genres and seamlessly weaves them in together (see what I did there?).
Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mind fuck.
Jednostavno nekad neka knjiga dugo stoji na listi za čitanje zaboravljena.Na moje veliko zadovoljstv
This is one of my very favorite books. I don't usually reread books, but I do with Weaveworld. It is so imaginative and fantastic - imagine the coolest, craziest rug you've ever seen. Then imagine that it's actually a world, whose magical inhabitants wove themselves into the rug to hide themselves from The Scourge, which seeks to destroy them.A rather silly British fellow has a few of these magical people appear from a torn segment of the rug, and he's off on the most intense adventure...
Another great book! Fantastic fantasy novel. A story of Good versus Evil. Inner-space. Extra dimensional fantasy. A universe embedded in the fabric of a magical carpet. Supremely composed by one of the great horror writers, Clive Barker.🐯👍
Το Weaveworld είναι το πρώτο βιβλίο του Clive Barker που έπεσε στα χέρια μου.Το βιβλίο περιγράφει την ύπαρξη μίας μαγικής χώρας που δεν ξέρει κανείς ότι υπάρχει και την προσπάθεια των πρωταγωνιστών να την σώσουν από την καταστροφή.
Η αφήγηση είναι καθηλωτική και τα τόπια που περιγράφει απίστευτα.
Ο συγγραφέας χαλαρώνει την ένταση στην ιστορία και την ώρα που λες ότι δεν γίνεται τίποτα, συμβαίνει κάτι απρόοπτο και ανατρέπει ότι υπήρχε στο μυαλό του αναγνώστη μέχρι στιγμής.
Ο Clive Barker είναι ένας από τους καλύτερους συγγραφείς βιβλίων τρόμου στον κόσμο...
Αυτά που περιγράφει, πολλές φορές αγγίζουν τα όρια της 
Ίσως πολλές φορές και να τα ξεπερνούν!
Ovaj Barker mi se neobično dopao, možda što je više koncentriran na fantasy umjesto na horror.Pročitao jedno 3-4 puta - preporuka svim žanroljupcima.
Άλλο ένα βιβλίο που έκανα refresh πρόσφατα.
(Αρχές Ιούνη).
Θυμάμαι πολύ καλά ότι το αγόρασα το 1997, τότε που ουσιαστικά μόλις ανακάλυπτα ότι η παγκόσμια λογοτεχνία διαφέρει χαοτικά από την ελληνική.
Στην πρώτη του ανάγνωση, αν υπήρχε το goodreads, θα του έβαζα περίπου 6 αστεράκια!
20 χρόνια μετά, μάλλον ο βαθμός έπεσε στα… 4,5 στα 5!
Εξακολουθεί να μου φαίνεται εξαιρετικά ευανάγνωστο και εξακολουθώ να ομολογώ ότι ο Barker εδώ έχει δώσει ιδέες που θα χωρούσαν και σε τρία ή τέσσερα μυθιστορήματα.
Νομίζω ότι απλώς πλέον θα το προτιμούσα καμιά 100 σελίδες μικρότερο.
Είναι πάντως σίγουρα σημείο αναφοράς για τη λογοτεχνία του φανταστικού.
I found this book to be very long winded while at the same time it did not reveal much and left you wondering many questions.
I found Cal to be a likable protagonist but did not care for Suzanne,the other main character.
I felt the book should have ended at the three quarter mark where much of the main story lines were resolved.
The last quarter of the book was painful to me as I no longer cared.
If found this to be a long, drawn out story, that was not very detailed, and I never really found myself attached to the characters within.
It has been so many years since I read most of Clive Barker's books, that the details of the books have begun to fade (it's old age, I know).
You know those books that give you butterflies at the mention of them?
I may not remember the details, but I do remembered being engrossed in this book for ages, and it being a magical and fantastical experience.
This is at the top of my list when it comes to re-reading any of my Clive Barker books.
I can't wait to read it again.
I just need to find more hours in the day first ;-)
Lo he dejado. Por un lado me gustaba por las premisas fantásticas que me chiflaban de joven. Por otro lado es lento y poco impactante.
But when I did, it takes you on an amazing ride.Plot ***Spoilers***The novel revolves around the world of the Fugue, a magical world which lies woven within a rug.Many decades ago the Seerkind (creatures of magical abilities) decided to hide themselves through a spell or "Rapture" in a safe haven after being hunted down and eradicated by humans for centuries (with humans most commonly depicting them as demons and fairies in their mythological tales) as well as being decimated by a destructive being known as The Scourge - The Scourge's form is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, given that none of those assaulted by the Scourge survived to describe it.
It took me awhile to read because it's soo big, but it was worth it.It's a little hard to explain, but I'll give it a go.
The general story is about a magic carpet that has a city weaved into it.
Lots of magic and lots of imagination!The flow of the story is a little jumpy.
That's probably the main reason it took me so long to read it because I pounded through the good parts and then lazily read the lulled parts.Overall it was a great book and I recommend it for a summer read.
