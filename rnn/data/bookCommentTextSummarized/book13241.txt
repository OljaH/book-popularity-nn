پیتر سنگه توضیح می‌دهد: اگر کسی می‌خواهد یک سازمان یادگیرنده بنا کند (یا سازمان خود را به یک سازمان یادگیرنده تبدیل کند) باید در ایجاد و توسعه‌ ی پنج حوزه، سرمایه گذاری نماید.
This book is of biblical importance to any 'systems thinker' and/ or a life long learner, specifically in a organizational context as opposed to a lone ranger situation.The book traces the endemic learning disabilities that plague most organizations, expounds on the fundamental laws of the fifth discipline, and describes typical ‘system archetypes’ that constitute dysfunctional patterns which impede performance.Upon that foundation, it goes to describe each of the five disciplines: personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, team learning and systems thinking.
This edition goes on to provide a practitioner’s handbook for implementation: the impetus for change, strategies for learning organizations, the new role of leadership and the recipe for systems citizenship.
مدت زیادی بود که این کتاب در کتابخانه بود و میخواستم مطالعه کنم.
از طرف دیگر خیلی وقت بود که به دنبال مطالعه درباره تفکر سیستمی بودم دریغ از اینکه چنین کتاب ارزشمندی در کتابخانه خاک میخورد.
با وجودی که کتاب در سال 1990 نوشته شده اغلب اوقات احساس کهنگی نمی کنید و به خوبی با مفاهیم تفکر سیستمی و پیچیدگی آشنا می شوید.
ضمیمه 20 صفحه ای که در انتهای کتاب وجود دارد درواقع کل کتاب را به شکلی زیبا مرور می کند به گونه ای که اگر بخواهید چند ماه آینده مجددا کتاب را بازنگری کنید مرور همین 20 صفحه تقریبا 80درصد کتاب را پوشش می دهد.درمجموع از وقتی که بابت مطالعه این کتاب گذاشتم بسیار راضی بودم زیرا مطالب آن علاوه بر مدیریت سازمانها برای زندگی شخصی نیز مفید است.
This is archetype has paired balancing processes that affect a variable / problem.
The other process digs at the heart of the problem but frequently has a delay, so that it is “easier” to use the temporary fix.
A special case where an external entity is the quick fix, slowly eroding the internal ability to solve the problem.
Two reinforcing processes linked by a common problem.
This is a type of Limits to growth where the balancing process is sort of a Shifting the burden.
Having a personal vision that causes internal tension and a desire to change and move in new directions.

Handle this change process correctly, involve everyone in your organisation, enroll them and make true sustainability - people, profit, planet - REAL and rewarded - and sit back and watch how productivity and morale improve, how innovations leads to improvement of the bottom line.We have reached the Limits to Growth - and so conventional management/leadership practice, where the CEO or Board decide on some ridiculous and unachievable financial growth target, so as to satisfy their shareholders and to deliver on the HUGE incentive packages of the CEO's, is simply very last century.
Если сравнивать её с подавляющим большинством другой деловой литературы, то приходишь к выводу, что когда многие не менее уважаемые авторы борются с симптомами, то Сенге же выискивает сам корень проблемы и учит решать сложные вопросы на фундаментальном уровне.Это далеко не новая мысль, но то с какими акцентами, аргументами, фактами и предлагаемыми методами внедрения Сенге ставит на повестку дня вопрос самообучающейся организации - это выводит данную книгу в разряд лучшей в своей теме, а самого автора можно смело признать одним из отцом такой дисциплины как "Управление знаниями" (knowledge management).
این نویسنده رو میشه به عنوان پدر تفکر سیستمی نام برد
I'm not going to write a formal review on this one, but it's worthy of a couple of comments.
I'm generally not a fan of business-success books, but Senge's observations about organizations and how they function--and can function better--is honest and spot on.
The Learning Organizations are those that see the greatest success, and largely because their leaders cultivate an appropriately humble approach to mission fulfillment.
Everybody, including top leaders, are part of the organization: they are not the organization, and the organization is not them.
When an organization applies the principles Senge lays out, it can be highly effective.
The point being that the underlying long-term source of success in an organization is not its present strategy but its people and culture.
Only the quality of its people and a culture of openness allow an organization to continually, adapt, learn and grow.
Collins touched on this idea in G2G when he discussed "getting the right people on the bus" but he made the fatal consulting mistake of seeing the overall results as static and linear, rather than dynamic and self-reinforcing.However, there are five main points that can summarize Senge's Peter M.
I think I started it four or five times before I was able to finish it.
I would pick it up read a few chapters and then drop out.
I'd pick it up again, start over, and then drop out again.
It was Wyllis Terry who finally said, don't start it over, just keep reading from where you left off which allowed me to finally finish it.
It is such a basic leadership book and really helps with looking at the whole system and not just the piece that you are working with.I heard Senge a couple of times speak to systems thinking.
I found it more enjoyable now than I did when I read it the first time, perhaps because systems thinking has become such a core part of what we discuss in our company and with our clients.
Most of the texts that I read on systems thinking when I was in school and even today are written in a very 'smarter than you' tone; I think that one of the greatest features of this book is that its choice of language is very accessible.
I think that there are times when the writing became slightly redundant, but I did not mind as the examples that Senge gives are excellent.
Good ideas, but far too much stories and quasi-philosophical fluff. Could have been edited to one third of its size.
I was introduced with this book in a reading group in Tehran.At first I had to read the first two chapters of the book in order to attend at that event.After reading these two chapters, I honestly got interested and read the rest of it.The whole idea around this book is how an organization can improve, not by itself but by helping all of the people working in.
Well, I listened to the abridged version (unknowingly at first), I think I should at least partially reread the unabridged version. Points on mental models and systems thinking are useful and to the point.
To begin with, most business books feel terribly pretentious, even if the authors aren't in reality that way." The Fifth Disciple was a reminder of what I wrote that.
The last 80 pages or so in particular are far more interested in evangelizing the ideas the author finds important rather than clearly stating the ideas and letting them stand on their own merit.I felt that Senge's book does in fact tap into some very fundamental and essential ideas.
However, the explication of the ideas, including the fifth discipline itself, is so clunky and unmemorable, I'm struggling to remember the last time I read an author who was so passionate about their subject matter but fumbled so badly in explaining it.
Each provides a vital dimension in building organizations that can truly 'learn," that can continually enhance their capacity to realize their highest aspirations: Systems Thinking...Personal Mastery...Mental Models...Building Shared Vision...Team Learning."Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- "At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind—from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to :ted to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something "out there" to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience.
It forces people to work harder and harder to compensate for failing to tap the spirit and collective intelligence that characterizes working together at their best.”The five disciplines that organizations need in order to move into the next level of quality and competition:#1# SYSTEMS THINKING - The ability to see the patterns behind any behavior, whether it is in the company or on a much more personal level.
الكتاب ممتع ووافر جدا خاصة للمهتمّن بفهم المنظومات وإدارتها على إختلاف شكلها ( شخص، مؤسسة،مجتمع أودو
It's a management book that is about 150 to 200 pages too long.
The books and people he quotes from are people that I like, and the discussion around systems thinking is important.
However, his writing style kept me from ever getting into that reading "flow." It felt like I was reading a textbook while the author lectured to me in monotone.
Would I have had a different experience if I had not been required to read this book for work?
I guarantee I wouldn't have read past the first three pages.
It is enormous and, at times, too much. But there are great nuggets of thought here, things which incite future action and discussion. It definitely serves more as a reference material than a book that should be read through from cover to cover.
The densest of the dense. Some good takeaways, but not very accessible.
it was okay. Some nice nuggets and examples but not as fulfilling as I had hoped. Commitment vs compliance, enrolling vs being sold both excellent concepts. also enjoyed the pattern of the beer game.
The Disciplines. Peter M. Senge presents five component technologies, or disciplines, in the book The Fifth Discipline o Systems Thinking – a conceptual framework, a body of knowledge and tools that make the full patterns of invisible fabrics of interrelated actions (systems) clearer and which helps to change them effectivelyo Personal Mastery – as with a master craftsman, this is a continual clarifying and deepening of our personal vision, focusing of our energies, developing patience, and see

If you have always had the feeling that there is something wrong with your organisation/institution and you have been unable to define it; if you have not found the right language to describe the ills; if you have always wanted to draw a larger and clearer picture of the workings of the organism that your organisation is, but never found the right brush - look no further, this book is the answer.
This is not one book that you can read and put away in a couple of days.
You will have to dwell on most of the sentences, build on your ideas, on concepts as you read through.
You will find yourself building a dream for your organisation as you understand the idea of a learning organisation.
At the time there were a lot of discussions around making our organization a learning organization to compete with the Japanese.
Within a couple of years “Learning Organization” was not talked about much other than by a few, die-hard zealots.In the Fifth Discipline, Peter Senge discusses some essential truths that contemporaries such as Dr. Deming had talked about for decades.
The Toyota Way, Dr. Jeffrey Liker, discusses the learning organization as a combination of Hansei and Kaizen in a continuous loop.
The audiobook is a combination of a narrator reading selected text with the author discussing in his own words the impact of that text.
Vijf disciplines die je nodig hebt om een lerende organisatie te worden. Personal Mastery, Shared vision, Mental models, Team learning en Systems thinking. Wat ik er uithaal is dat alleen kunt komen tot een gedeelde visie als je persoonlijke visie helder is. Daar gaat  het volgens mij al snel mis bij alle veranderingen in organisaties. Ook het onderdeel over Systems thinking is blijven hangen. In onze taal zijn we heel doel gericht: Ik schenk water in. Klinkt logisch, lineair. Senge laat ons zie
Wat ik er uithaal is dat alleen kunt komen tot een gedeelde visie als je persoonlijke visie helder is.
het volgens mij al snel mis bij alle veranderingen in organisaties.
Ook het onderdeel over Systems thinking is blijven hangen.
Senge laat ons zien dat elk systeem uit vele cirkels bestaat in plaats van uit lineaire handelingen.
Want ik kan alleen water inschenken als ik continu feedback krijg over de hoeveelheid die uit de kraan komt, de stijging van het water in mijn glas en de mate waarin de kraan openstaat.
Door een feedback loop zorg ik ervoor dat het glas niet overstroomt.
Groups of people acting many-to-many to allow society to change course (think Presidential election 2008).This is not about technology or management tricks.
It is about changing the way you think about problems so that you can get out of the way, organizationally and personally.It's as much a self-help book as a business book.Definitely one to re-read from time to time.
"Recommended reading! The organizations that will truly excel in the future will be those that discover how to tap peopleâs commitment and develop the capacity to learn at all levels in an organization. Deep down, people are learners. No one has to teach an infant to learn. In fact, no one has to teach infants anything. They are intrinsically inquisitive, masterful learners.

The organizations that will truly excel in the future will be those that discover how to tap peopleâs commitment and develop the capacity to learn at all levels in an organization.
No one has to teach an infant to learn.
Through learning we re-create ourselves and are able to do something we were never able to do earlier.
Through learning we extend our capacity to create, to be part of the generative process of life.
There is within each of us a deep hunger for this type of learning.
This seminal book by Peter M Senge explains how learning organizations can be built.
It's one of those books that change your perspective of life. You start seeing everything around you in terms of loops. The book takes its time to give you those lenses but at times it seems a little dragged. It has some great examples but could use some more cases.
