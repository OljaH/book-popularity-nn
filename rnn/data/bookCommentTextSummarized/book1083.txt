Concerning himself with utopias of escape and utopias of reconstruction, Lewis Mumford takes a hard look at the utopian dreams that people have had throughout the ages. Mumford holds these stories up against our own world and shows that there really are no simple solutions without work and effort. Anything else is just day-dreaming.
The walk-through Mumford led his reader in the various (or not so various) utopias probably deserved three stars, but the last three chapters added another to this book.
At certain points he spoke like a prophet, and I believe he is right to point out the lack of true "scientific" inquiry of social fact in ideological charged social sciences, the problem of over-specialization of a science (and consequently also technology) detached from the benefit of community, and the "art for artist sake", or the culture industry as Frankfurt philosophers would later describe it, that prevents people to increase their aesthetic capability of perceiving and thinking about a better world.
Hope I will later found more intriguing thought in his magnum opus: Technics and Civilization.
Interessante lettura che prende in considerazione alcuni dei filosofi più importanti che hanno scritto di utopia. Ho trovato più affascinante la prima parte
Most of the utopias presented are quite boring and repetitive, so this would work better as a consultation book, but not the way the information is organized. Could have done quite well without reading it.
Historia de las Utopías es un volumen de consulta más, sin analizar profundamente las motivaciones que llevan al hombre a elaborar los mundos ideales.
