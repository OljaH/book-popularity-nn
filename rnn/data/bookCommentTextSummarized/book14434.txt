Dropped from 4 to 3 on a re-read. Very cheesy. He was an ass and she was a drip.----------------------------------------Really liked this one.
BOOK IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AS THE HERO IS A BIG CHEATERHe sees nothing wrong with having multiple sex partner and he was with another after the heroine.
So this book is now a big NOOOO FOR ME.
However, the only good part of the whole book is when she talks down to him after he slept with somebody else after having sex with her.
He tells her it's no big deal that it was her first time.
Then, She tells him that he was great and hence would send her daughter to him for deflowing when she was old enough cause she knew he was useless as a mate in any real respect.
I liked Nick but he is not a typical McNaught character where he meets heroine and pursues her right away.
For the first part of the book we draw conclusions only from dialogue, McNaught never writes from his point of view or describes his feelings, which is what she does in all other books I have read.Lauren is beautiful, charming, witty and adorable.
Nick and Lauren’s witty dialogue and their meetings at work were fantastic.
This book did it for me.
I know it was outdated and definitely showed its age with some political incorrectness in sexual harassment in the office place, but I loved the story.
I thought Nick was arrogant and a user and pulled one over on Lauren.
He lead her to believe he was really into her and more than a one night stand.
Since she was so innocent she didn't realize what a rake he was, but once she did she was strong and lead him on a merry chase.
I love these kind of stories!!
No se que ha tenido esta historia que a mi me ha molado, es verdad que es un telefín de Domingo por la tarde,pero en dos días me lo he ventilado.Me gusta como escribe esta autora,ya había leído una de sus series y me encantó..Así que ha seguir leyendo libros de ella.
The main guy was a...I don't know about you but bad boys are bad for the heart.
They are also not good for the consumption.
Totally a big no no for certified evil man pretending to be a hero at the end.
Nick was such a completely ugly illustration of a man.
He was selfish, self-centered and egoistic.
He had no redeeming point whatsoever.
It was a pain to read how the main girl "tried" to resist Nick but said yes to him over and over again.
The cycle never ends.
I am in love with it however I am not in love with the story's ending or the Main Character's love interest.Like I said, I love alpha males but I just really can't put up with guys manhandling women.
I understand how couples are into kinky stuff like that but this guy in the story is the worst; a guy who claims he loves the woman and then suddenly drops her, ruin her value just because he was hurt or felt betrayed.
Can't a woman explain herself first?
Can't she at least deserved that?I would have rated this higher if I find justice for the ending but no can do.
4.5 Rating.I had some issues with Nick. Absolutely adored Lauren.
Well the story was intriguing, but unfortunately the characters were lacking.
The book was a bit dated, as it was published in 1984, but that really didn't bother me.
What did was the lack of connection I felt towards the characters.
The story did kind of pick up near the end when the heroine finally developed a little backbone.
But the hero never really did much for me which is rare for me among JM's books.
All in all, I think I may have been expecting just a bit more from her.
I suppose everyone is entitled to a slip from perfection every now and again.
1 Star...What to say, what to say....As you all know I'm a huge McNaught fan, but this one was an absolute, no way around it, not even going to give a sympathy star for one of my favorite authors...Stinker!
And I had a feeling it would be after the first 2 chapters.
The storyline seemed very rushed and the chemistry between the two was at a minimum luke warm...If this is your first McNaught book please take my advice and do not read this one first.
You will miss out on a brilliant storyteller and some of the best romance novels I've ever read.
“He interrupted her with a boyish grin. "I promise I'll never wear your clothes, and I won't steal your allowances or your boyfriends either." Lauren couldn't help starting to smile as he finished, "And if you swear never to call me Nicky again, I won't bite you."She stepped aside and let him in, then took his jacket and hung it in the closet. When she turned, Nick was leaning against the closed front door, his arms crossed over his chest. "On second thought," he grinned, "I take part of that ba
The first one third of this book seemed to just be the story of 'How Lauren Danner got everything a girl could possibly want' which didn't exactly provoke much empathy for her even when things started going wrong.
Like *bam* two days after meeting Lauren decides she's in love with Nick.
There is a little bit of suspense at the end but its solved very quickly.Despite the book's shortcomings I did like the witty banter between the two and some of the things Lauren said to Nick were quite funny and I found myself reluctantly thinking "You go girl!" I'm sort of glad the book wrapped up quickly because I think I wouldn't have enjoyed reading more.
I read it and while I didn't love it, I didn't totally hate it.
H was a pig and seduced the h cold bloodedly.
He then dumped her and went back to his manwhore ways.
I gave it two stars simply because the h made me laugh.
When she said she would let him deflower her daughter when she came of age his reaction was priceless.
I laughed so hard.
He was a jerk and I wish he would have grovelled more.
The heroines corpse was barely cold.
So much for his true love.
Glad I read it but its not a keeper.
Kitap boyunca Nick’e sinirlenmekten başka bir şey yapamadım.
Nick’ten ne kadar nefret ettiysem, Lauren’ı da o kadar sevdim.
Son bölümde resmen bir yandan gözlerim doldu, bir yandan sinirden köpürdüm.
😰😔Son kısmı biraz aceleye gelmiş gibi oldu, araştırmanın yapılması, özür dilemesi ve affetmesi 15-20 sayfaya sıkıştırılmıştı.
Oysa Lauren’a gibi bir karaktere yakışan biraz daha kapısında süründürmekti.
Onun dışında yazarın kalemi çok hoşuma gitti.
Kitabın en güzel yerleri Nick ve Lauren arasında geçen diyaloglardı.
🙃 Tabi sadece Lauren’ı yazdığı kısmı beğendim, Nick kısmında bana göre epey sorun vardı.
Hayatımda bu kadar kendini beğenmiş, ukala, pislik, hödük bir karakter daha okumadım.
This one totally follows the author's McNaughizing plots, with the hero eventually going into jerk mode over the big misunderstanding then having to come crawling back on his knees when he realizes how wrong he was.But c'mon, who doesnt like a man brought to his knees over his own actions?
So, though it's certainly not one of her best, I liked it.
(I read the entire thing in one sitting.) Imo, a "bad" Judith Mcnaught, is better than most that are considered "good" in romance novels now-a-days.
She always manages to engage my emotions.Dated setting and attitude toward women in the workplace and jerkmode aside, I'm going with a 3 out of 5.
I didn't like Nick much at the beginning of the story.
He's a douche.
Further, he is the typical modern romance stereotype: dark, brooding, self made billionaire, six feet three, broad shoulders, etc.
Not very imaginative.
The heroine seems very grown up for her age.
One wonders sometimes when she comes up with replies that would more a thirty something heroine instead a twenty year old.
Besides the characters, I liked the story.
You saw the train wreck coming from the start and Mrs. McNaught made a good job with the side characters and at drawing the business environment.
Un chechiflín ochentero con poca chicha. Pasas un ratico y ya.
Bu yorum aynı zamanda Romancekolikte yayınlanmıştır.Kitabı bitirdim ve bilemiyorum belki uzun zaman oldu Judith McNaught okumayalı, tarzını unuttum veya bu kitap gerçektende diğerlerinden farklıydı. Kurgusu olsun, karakterleri olsun değişikti. Severek , beğenerek okudum. Nick'in kendinden emin tavırları, konuşmaları, hareketleri kimi zaman beni benden alacak kadar sinirlendirsede, iş tatlıya bağlandığı için mesudum. Yazarımızın bundan sonra çıkıpta okucağımız kitaplar arasında kötünün iyisiydi
Nick'in kendinden emin tavırları, konuşmaları, hareketleri kimi zaman beni benden alacak kadar sinirlendirsede, iş tatlıya bağlandığı için mesudum.
Bir Sana İhtiyacım Var kadar da hayalkırıklığına uğratmadı beni hikaye .
Zengin akraba olan Philip Whitworth aynı zamanda Nick'in üvey babasıdır.
Bunun üzerine Lauren'ı casus diye Nick'in şirketine yollar.
Hoşuma giden bir dialoğu sizlerle paylaşayım.Nick - Beni özledin mi?Lauren - Sence?N - Güzel ne kadar özledin?L - Bugün egonun okşanmasına mı ihtiyacın var?N - EvetL - Öyle mi, neden peki?N - Çünkü 23 yaşında güzel bir kadına vuruldum ve onu bir türlü aklımdan çıkaramıyorum.L - Çok yazıkN - Değil mi?
The end was too abrupt.
I know this is JM's earlier writing, but I know that some of her newer offerings don't always give enough time at the end to show evidence of reconciliation.
Wedding.' I am left wondering if the two have learned to communicate to avoid future 'big misunderstandings'.
When they (the writer) can completely sell you on the disfunction, as to why the characters can blow it so bad in their mistreatment of each other, they should be able to then show that the characters can now make healthy future decisions (HEA) and really deal with what caused the 'BIG misunderstanding'.
This book was filled with really inappropriate office relationships.Banging the boss is normally a bad idea.Having a fake flirtation with your other boss to make the other one jealous is normally not something you should do.Nick (teh boss) is such a douche, and an asshole.
He made me all ragey while reading this.
I prefer assholes in Bodice Rippers but not in regular romance.
He also has some mother issues, which the heroine magically fixes.
lol)The heroine was at least feisty and didn't put up with shit, but my god, she eventually got with him.
HATE.Over-all an entertaining read, but some parts made me feel like punching something.Karla, this one is being sent to you.
I haven't read a alpha, jerk hero like Nick in a long time, but if I remember my Judith McNaught history correctly, she had some doozies, but always redeemed them by the love of a good, solid, beautiful heroine.
Angst and alpha A-Hole hero, Judith McNaught style, and I do mean style.
Very few authors can make me swallow that combination, but JMN has such a flair and real style that I'm reading it and waiting to see what Lauren does to that Jerk, Nick.
Lauren heads to Detroit and, hopefully, a job that can help dig her family out of debt.
REVIEW OF AUDIOBOOK; FEB 22, 2014Narrator: Margaret BallI love these oldies.
The good thing about it, when I am brave enough to tackle a romance written in the bad ol '80s is that I can't complain about any nasty surprises.
I did still remember, though, that it had to do with the heroine infiltrating the hero's company and the train wreck that follows when they fall in love.
There are so many good romances and romantic suspenses out there from yesteryear that I want to see in downloadable mp3 with new narrators.
4.5 stars. An epilogue would have made this one 5 stars I think.
This turned out to be an okay read after all.
It started really slow for me, but definitely picked up in the middle.
I loved the heroine.
She was an innocent, but she didn't make the arrogant hero walk all over her.
He got more than he bargained for with her.
I was cracking up at some of the things she said to the hero when he peed her off.
The ending was driven by a big misunderstanding which I hate, so it took away from a higher rating, but all in all, this was an okay HP-ish dated contemporary.
As much as I loved this one, it kinda makes me wonder if JM actually wrote it because it lacks the maturity that I usually find her writing.As far as contemporary romance go, the story truly delivers.
But there's no element of surprise as the plot is pretty cliche and cheesy.
Not that it is bad thing, especially when your own love life is non-existence.
So, this is a great book to be used as an escapism :) Maybe it is just me because I can't seem to get enough of JM's story, but I find the ending were rush and a few things were left unanswered.
This book was kind of confusing and frustrating for me. With "Whitney, my love" I knew I hated the book and its characters. This one I liked and disliked at the same time. It felt like a rollercoaster that went from "Oh, I actually like this scene and the character" to "I hate this and feel like dnf-ing it"
Es justo el argumento por el que dejé de leer otro tipo de novelas románticas más crotas. Un protagonista odioso junto a una protagonista inocente y, con todos mis respectos, ilusa.Pero a parte, le falta de todo....No me ha gustado nada.
Bu kitap çok eğlenceliydi. Sadece bir günümü almıştı. Akşam başladım sabaha kadar bitirmiştim. Akıcı ve kısaydı. En önemliside o zaman Judith Mcnaught hayranı oldum. Oylaması ve okunması düşük olmasına rağmen sevdim...
My very first McNaught book. The book is very dated now but the story and the characters captivated me from the first page. I was into anything written by JM after "Double Standards."
Judith McNaught es una de mis autoras románticas preferidas y, de hecho, Paraíso robado y Perfecta son libros suyos que están en mi top 10 de libros preferidos, así que las expectativas con esta historia estaban demasiado altas.El libro no me cerró desde el vamos, un instalove demasiado forzado y una historia que no termina de hilvanarse.Para mí le faltó desarrollo por todos lados. 😞
I debated whether to reread a different McNaught book instead of this one but I'm part of a reading challenge and there's not a lot of January left so I chose this one instead.
Philip Whitworth suspects he has a spy in his ranks because every time he bids on a contract, his competition, Sinco, always beats him out.
I can't go into much more detail without spoiling but for a book that was written before I was even born, it never fails to impress me every time I read it.
