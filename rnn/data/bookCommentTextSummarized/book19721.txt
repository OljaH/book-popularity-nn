Armentrout has ever written (yes, the extra "n" in Jennifer was originally a typo, but I decided to leave it in because that's just how awesome she is).
How can you not love a book with words like "dickdom" and "craptastic" or a phrase like, "my boobs just might come out and say hello tonight." When I wasn't having a total bookgasm for Daemon, I was laughing out loud!!
Often times, a book starts off great and climaxes great (insert immature giggle here), but suffers from "saggy middle syndrome".
There is nothing saggy about Daemon Onyx.
We don't get jipped with a "filler" sequel thats only purpose is to transition into book three.
Well, how about¬†HOW FREAKING AMAZING JLA IS!!!Onyx is¬†PERFECTION!
I won't say what happens exactly but I loved seeing the two acting like normal teens who like each other even if they won't admit it.Speaking of which, that also reminds me of how we got to know the characters more.
Katy wasn't the only character we learned more about though.
There were a lot of random facts, that were so small you'd think you'd miss them, about the characters and it added to their development.
I feel that those details are what makes the story and the characters more realistic.

Another thing, it shouldn't have taken her a millennium to finally accept Daemon's feels, sheesh, it's not like she's dense.
Daemon was sexy, charming, fiercely protective, determined, and romantic in this book, it just made me fall in love with him even more.Love triangle you say?
LOL, sorry, but yah, Blake just didn't do it for me, or Daemon for that matter.
In fact, Blake just made Daemon and Katy's relationship in this book even more complicated, the butt-face.
I'm glad Miss Armentrout decided to take up writing, I'm not sure where I would be without Katy and Daemon in my thoughts.
Holy alien babies everywhere,I can't decide whether I want to kiss or kill Jennifer L. Armentrout!I'm stressed and excited and scared and giddy and I can't turn off these emotions that threaten to drown me!Just give me the next book!  By New Year's Day,you'll have admitted that you're madly,deeply,irrevocably,and irresistibly in love with me.  While Daemon seemed sure that Kat would admit her feelings towards him,she tried to convince herself and everyone else that those feelings were nonexistan
While Daemon seemed sure that Kat would admit her feelings towards him,she tried to convince herself and everyone else that those feelings were nonexistant and that Daemon's decision to pursue her was the result of the creepy alien bond they shared.And that conviction cascaded a parade of bad bad decisions,from starting dating someone else (even though is was brief and sabotaged by Daemon) and playing ninja on her own to training with a dubious boy to explore her recently developed super powers and keeping secrets from the people she loved.Add her mom's new boyfriend,the DOD's sudden interest in her,curious disappearances,coincidences that were not coincidences and some huge revelations about alien mutations and that's it,Katy was not (could not be) the same person anymore.
The nice little paragraph poking fun at insta-love (this is the new trend in books lately...acting like the book is above stereotypes so people will think the story is somehow cooler than the last one they read) was sort of cancelled out by the pathetic love triangle that wasn't.
Instead of threatening the relationship with Daemon, the new girl could have threatened the friendship with Dee. Oh wait...Dee wasn't around much in this book.
A few extra random things : ~ The mention of Daemon not needing to breathe one moment, then a mention of his breath in Katy's hair the next sort of threw me off.
Obviously, there‚Äôs a lot I could talk about, like say, the complete lack of a plot in the first eighteen chapters, but I am so frustrated by how much I dislike Onyx that I have nothing nice to say, so I think I‚Äôm not going to say anything at all.
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs tragic, not gauche at all, I promise!Be prepared for a villain so transparent his sole redeeming quality is that the book invests so much time in the make out scenes he only gets three short chapters to do anything!
(More of a 3.75)

When he spoke, his voice was rough.‚ÄúDo you know what I‚Äôve been thinking about all day?‚Äù With him, it was anyone‚Äôs guess.‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His lips brushed the skin of my cheek.‚ÄúFinding out if you look as good in striped socks as you do in reindeer ones.‚Äù------------------------------------------------------------- He was lounging in a cubicle beside an outdated computer, hands shoved into the pockets of his faded jeans.
But the thing that finally convinced me to check it out was Julie's review over at All Things Urban Fantasy, where she said, "As much as I enjoyed OBSIDIAN, ONYX was even better." Confession time: Sometimes I start a book series just to get to a certain book in that series.
We have a noticeable amount of deeper character growth for both Daemon and Katy, all-around better plot, and of course, more banter & steamy scenes.
Instead, Katy's time in Onyx is almost completely monopolized by a new character, Blake, or as Daemon would call him: Bozo, due to his jealously that he manages to marginally hide from Katy.
My feelings for Daemon right now:   My thoughts for those who do not ship Daemon and Katy when I read all the cute scenes of them together: TOO ADORABLE - I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF DAEMON'S WICKED-HOT-BAD BOY-AND-DOWNRIGHT-GORGEOUS ACT!!This was such a cute short story - I was so depressed when it got to the end!! I wanted more!!! Can't wait until the next book - Jennifer's writing is addictive!Merged review: Uploaded with ImageShack.usDamn, Daemon. Just...wow. :D
This is my first ever DNF I got most of the way through it I just could not force myself to put up with anymore talk of sexy aliens and their kissable lips. Apparently I've outgrown my ability to like something like this. Yuck.
üåüüåüüåü 4,5 üåüüåüüåüŒöŒ±Œ±Œ±Œ±Œ±Œ±œÑ, œÄŒµœÇ Œ±ŒªŒµœçœÅŒπ....
Armentrout's awesomeness!In Obsidian, Katy met Dee and Daemon, brother and sister with a dangerous secret.
Now, in Onyx, Katy's relationship with the two siblings is stronger than ever, especially her all-too-hot relationship with Daemon.
‚ÄúI bet that by New Year‚Äôs Day, you will have admitted that you‚Äôre madly, deeply, and irrevocably‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúWow. Want to throw another adverb out there?‚Äù My cheeks were burning.
Daemon placed half the cookie between those full, totally kissable lips.Oh, holy alien babies everywhere...My mouth dropped open.
Heck, I kind of wanted to and I wasn't sure what that said about me.Daemon reached up and took the cookie.
‚ùùThat I'm lucky, because the person I can't get out of my head, the person who means more to me than I can, is still alive. She's still there. And that's you.‚ùû Oh boy oh boy! Let me just start off by saying that this book definitely had its improvements including character development, much more shocking and intense moments, more Katy and Daemon moments, and a less jerk-face known as Daemon Black. By that, I mean he isn't the same asshole he was in Obsidian. Even though this book had many more
Starting from where it left, ending to where I believe the next book will start.Onyx was actually not a major step up to Obsidian, it only had some things expected in a second novel.
With surprising moments coming together, everything had its right build up.The romance between Katy and Daemon was taken to a whole new other level!
Katy wasn't the same Katy she was introduced as in Obsidian, and Daemon isn't the douchebag known to ruin everything and be both hated and loved by fellow readers.
No tengo palabras. Jennifer supo como mantenerme atrapada en los eventos y los giros que daba la historia fueron, en definitiva, fuertes y vitales para el √©xito de √©sta secuela.Estoy ansiosa en ver como Dawson entra en juego y como se desarrolla la historia.
If your passion is to read greatness, then you my friends and fellow book lover are in for a real treat when you reach for Onyx by the sensational Jennifer Armentrout.Simpy put, this is UN-FREAKEN-BELIEVABLY AMAZING!!!!!Onyx begins right after the aftermath of Obsidian...and that's pretty much all I'm gonna say about the story-line.
I absolutely adored where she took the story, and if your fan of these books, I think you will too.I am however gonna gush about these amazing characters.
So all I'm gonna say is that I agree with Daemon wholeheartedly.Bottom line, I couldn't love a book more.
Amazing. Even better than Obsidian, and I LOVED that one. I can't wait for everyone to read this - it has everything that I love - the full range of emotion from laughing to gasping to crying, major adventure, and the incredible chemistry between Katy and Daemon. DAEMON!!!!
I am so heart broken you guys! I thought my book boyfriends ruined me for real boys bUT Daemon Black, this guy, he ruined me  for humans beings  all together. I will never love again!That's it! I am gonna self combust again.
Every damn feeling is floating inside me!At this point, i would like to hung and comfort some people......and at the same time i want to kick some butts of other people.
If you were in my place now, i'm pretty sure that you'll be feeling the same...In the beginning of "Onyx", the things were nearly the same as the first book.
Katy and Daemon still arguing all the time...The difference were that Katy didn't believe that Daemon have feelings for her and if he had...
I won't be in more details because i will ruin the whole thing if you're about to read it!!!
Incre√≠blemente entretenido, con mucha fluidez y una historia r√°pida de leer. Siento que este libro mejor√≥ con respecto al anterior, la protagonista definitivamente ha evolucionado, la historia tiene nuevos matices y el lector no solo conoce mas de la historia de los personajes, sino que tambi√©n entiendes mas la dimensi√≥n del mundo creado por la autora y hasta que punto est√°n implicados tanto el gobierno como los luxen. Espero leer pronto el tercer libro de la saga! Rese√±a Completa: http://bastvilard.blogspot.com.co/201...

This is the book that we will have a game-changing by Daemon, while Katy suffers by alien flu or something like that.In other words, Daemon will start pursuing Kate and Kate (after she had almost died in the previous book) will discover that she has some strange powers that she was not supposed to have and she cannot control.Yes, Daemon will still be a jerk most of the times.
-He feels jealousy for the first time in his human life because of the new boy in town.
And Daemon will turn green not because he is an alien but because jealousy makes him suffer.Kate on the other hand tries to deny that she is not the same Kate any more.

5 stars of course!! I love this series so frigging much!!
Katy is trying to move on with her life but it‚Äôs hard when she has Daemon Black trying to win her over at every turn.
It's action packed all the way through, with enough descriptions to make you really feel like your with the characters and this book is seriously HOT!
Even though they aren't the perfect couple, Daemon really tries his hardest to win Katy over.
You see a side of him that you have never seen before and it will seriously leave you girls wishing you had you're very own Daemon Black.
This book was very good but much sadder and action packed than the first one.
Katy is determined to not love Daemon despite their connection.
Blake starts to train her and this makes the rift between Katy and Daemon even wider.
In this book, Katy develops her powers and uses in them in new ways.
There are more arguments and feelings shared between Daemon and Katy which show both their personalities and their feelings for one another.
There is a cliff hanger at the end of the book dealing with the situation of a character.
DNF 53%I apologise in advance to my co-blogger Kara (who has already banished me from her life forever for this) for bashing on her favourite series and her book boyfriend, but I have to call it quits here.I probably would've gobbled up this story when I was 16 years old and new to the YA world, but enough is enough.
I've had it with overbearing, overprotective, controlling boyfriends.
He also refuses to stop calling Katy "Kitten" despite her asking him a thousand times, manhandles her, tracks her every movement, doesn't take "no" for an answer, and grows violent and possessive whenever another guy so much as looks at her.
DNF at 60%.
I think I'm done with this series.
The plot with the DOD and aliens is creative and I still like a lot of elements (like Katy's friendship with Dee) but I just  cannot stand Daemon.
The guy is a complete asshole and does not improve.
I'm glad he's not explicitly abusive or as big of a jerk as some other YA guys, but not being the worst thing ever doesn't really redeem him.
Katy goes on a date with another guy, so Daemon shows up to sabotage it and dump noodles on the guy.
And guys being "scary" are just...

Holy blazing smokes! ALL. THE. FEELS. I swear its exactly like this.. Onyx was breathtaking, heart stopping, adrenaline pumping, hair tearing, and everything in between! I -honest to all the baby aliens everywhere- was exhausted after all the emotions this book has made me felt! It was like being in a broken and demented roller coaster. Insane and DIDN'T. FREAKING. STOPPED. It just went on and on and on.... that I just sat there, thinking Dammit! This book will make me lose my mind, but oh hell
Onyx was breathtaking, heart stopping, adrenaline pumping, hair tearing, and everything in between!
Oh, I love this girl.
I love that she is a book addict and a blogger.
I just love her.Daemon.
(view spoiler)[ I don't get why he got jealous over Blake, I mean THERE'S LIKE NO OBVIOUS COMPETITION THERE.
Daemon kissed like he was a man starving for water, taking long, breathless drafts.
‚ÄúSay it.""Say what?""Tell me what you told me earlier.""I love you.""That's all I ever need to hear.""Those three words?""Always those three words.‚Äù 
I need Daemon earlier..like NOW!!!!NOOOOOOOOO!
