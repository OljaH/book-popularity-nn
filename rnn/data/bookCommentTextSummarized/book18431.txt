Some people wanted Day to die, don't know why, but I didn't want him to die.There was this scene in the novel that made me realize how much I hate dead mother's who come back once their kid's at death's door (view spoiler)[[Allegiant, anyone?] (hide spoiler)].
Politics are rough, but at least Champion, and the series in general, makes you think about these problems, and realize that it isn't easy running a country without making some mistakes.The bittersweet end: Day loses all memories of June, yet he survives.
it's over.This series has come a long, long way from where it started and has managed to shatter boundaries and exceed expectations where, in my opinion, other series like Divergent and Blood Red Road have failed.
For me, June and Day have come a long way and matured so much since book one.
Looking back, I have a certain respect for the author in the way she portrayed their initial meeting and the start of their relationship.
But this book made my eyes fill up at the end.
Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out.
IT'S NOT LIKE AUTHORS KILL THEIR MAIN CHARACTERS OR ANYTHING AHAHA AH HA HA AH HAAJSLKGHIWE;DKLJSVAHEIUF'OJLDKSAGIFEJ;KLDFSJKL *deep breaths* If you have no idea what that was about then that's good, you haven't been subjected to the torture of reading a certain YA book where the main character dies.So anyways, at least we all know June and Day end up together at last.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF DAY MADE EYE CONTACT AND WAS LIKE WAIT I KNOW YOU, YOU'RE JUNE AND WE'RE SOULMATES SO BASICALLY LET'S GO HAVE SEX OKAYThat scene.
5 STARS(WARNING: MILD SPOILERS) "I think I don’t care about you anymore, that things will be easier once you’re far away, and then all of a sudden I’m here again, and you’re..." Day pauses to look at me. The anguish in his expression is a knife cutting through my heart. "Why do I do this to myself? I see you and feel such—" He has tears in his eyes now. The sight is more than I can bear. He takes two steps away from me and then turns back like a caged animal. "Do you even love me?" ■■■My emotion
"I think I don’t care about you anymore, that things will be easier once you’re far away, and then all of a sudden I’m here again, and you’re..." Day pauses to look at me.
If June is one of the scariest, most clever, and bravest characters I've ever known, Day is absolutely one of the most strong-willed, loving, and most genuine of all.
I've come across several books directly echoing a real and worse tragedy—rape, mass killing, suicide, murder, etc—and I say nothing has affected me on a deep emotional level like Day's illness.

And just like that, I am linked with him again, I feel the pulse of our bond and his- tory and love through our hands, like a wave of magic, the return of a long-lost friend. Of something meant to be. The feeling brings tears to my eyes. Perhaps we can take a step forward together.“Hi,” he says. “I’m Daniel.”“Hi,” I reply. “I’m June.”   ________________________________
You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!And here I present you to my favorite dystopian series.The legend series has been one of my greatest experiences on reading,especially this book,which I totally consider a LEGENDARY book.And finally here is a trilogy with a great awesome perfect ending.I think this is the reason why Legend,for me,it is the best dystopian series out there,because the ending didn't disappoint.I liked The Hunger Games and Divergent too,but they both went downhill.I must congratulate the author for this finale,she proved that it is possible to end a series without killing main characters just to make it emotional.So great job Marie Lu!Champion is the finale(the third book) in the "Legend" trilogy by Marie Lu.This is a full action-pack dystopian filled with everything,smart action,smart thoughts,wise plans and romance and just everything.It is a perfection,especially this book.____________________________________________
This book makes we want to do this:This: BECAUSE MY BRAIN ISN'T WORKING AFTER READING THIS, like NO!
Otherwise, you are going to give endless emotions to your readers and make them extremely unproductive because they are too busy crying into their pillows out of happiness.Not only are the characters amazing, Marie Lu doesn't pull a Mockingjay.
It will leave you satisfied, but unable to think, and then it will leave you crying tears of happiness as you shake the book wondering why it ended.
Finally, Day and June: ULTIMATE OTP Yeah, I just ripped off the title of the first book.
This book had me sad crying and happy crying!
Although, there was a lot of sadness and worry throughout the book I was just hoping and praying it was going to end well.
Some things are going on with little Eden and with Day. I was so worried.
And I have to say I was worried for Ollie through the whole book, but guess what?
I hate that I waited so long to read it, but don't we say that about so many books we own .
Usually when people tell me that a book is super emotional I wind up shrugging at the end instead of crying because I've braced myself for the worst.
And SO many people kept telling me I'd be sobbing at the end of this book that I went into it ready for pretty much anything.
BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT.Ughhh not ok.
Marie Lu writes the most amazing character-driven & action-packed stories.
I am so thankful to everyone who talked me out of my "I'm over dystopian YA" nonsense and made me finally read these because they were amazing!!
Edit 4:That cover is beautiful! I want it now!Edit 3:2013 guys! 20-freaking-13! This is amazing! THIS IS SO GREAT! I'm just so excited!Edit 2:*Screams* We've got a placement cover! I'm so so so excited! Can't wait until we get the real deal cover!Edit:So it has a name? Champion... I like it! :)Wait... 2014...?
Marie Lu is still an extremely talented writer, and if you think I hate her in any way, shape, or form, I hope the next time you eat pie it's filled with pig saliva and miley cyrus's tongue.
I still like this book, just not as much as I was hoping too.
So even before I read the first page, I was expecting a finale even better than Prodigy, even better than Legend, and that is (sadly) not what I got.
YET: (view spoiler)[Am I the only one who gets super pissed off every time the teenage protagonist/love interest have sex?
After FinishingWARNING: If you like happy endings, you may not want to read this happy ending-bashing review  Almost a year has passed since June Iparis was initiated back into the Republic as one of the new Elector's Princeps-Elect and Day Wing became a part of the Republic's army.
I loved Elector's character and honestly shipped him with June more than with Day. Adding another cliche factor, an evil male political villain who threatens male character with the 'can't guarantee your female friend's safety' spiel, and the book started to go downhill.
Odio los finales abiertos.✨✨✨Daniel "Day" Wing now lives as a free citizen, along with his brother Eden.Day and June have had to give up many things to facilitate peace in The Republic.After eight months of being incommunicado, they call him to invite him to a feast with the Elector but it is only an excuse to ask for his help again, but this time they will ask for more than he is willing to give.This book has a lot of action and is very emotional, but I HATE the ending.
I hate open endings.
BEFORE READINGNo no no no NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!YOU DO NOT GET TO END LIKE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please hurry up and come out!!!Please tell me that the ending was untrue!!!!PLEEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EDIT:HOLY CHEESE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THERE'S A COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not sure how I feel about it, BUT THERE'S A COVER!!!!!!!WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE RELEASE DATE!!!
This is me after rereading the last chapter over and over again... Why the hell do you do that and make everyone wait a year! She should have said " I love you!" That's what i'm waiting for, so that better be like the first line in the book! Not in her head, needs to be said directly to him!Like this:But Day I just wanna...
Πολύ ωραίο και ρεαλιστικό τέλος!Θρύλος: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ και μισοΠαιδί-θαυμα: ⭐⭐⭐Πρόμαχος: ⭐⭐Το πρώτο παραμένει το αγαπημένο μου! Δυνατό και γρήγορο, γεμάτο εξελίξεις, αν και το ρομάντζο μου φάνηκε κάπως βεβιασμενο. Στην πορεία αισθάνθηκα πως η ιστορία έχανε την έντασή της. Σε ορισμένα σημεία γινόταν βαρετή και οι σκηνές τραβουσαν. Ενώ στα βιβλία 2-3 έχουμε περισσότερες σελίδες, στο πρώτο έχουμε περισσότερα γεγονότα σε λιγότερες σελίδες. Επίσης ηθελα να δω πιο πολλές σκηνές ανάμεσα σε ντευ και τζουν. Δεν δέθηκα με το ζευγάρι εξαιτίας αυτού...
Perfect books are just.. perfect! *wiping tears of happiness* This is one of the best conclusions to a series! The very best. Seriously! And it felt so ..right, you know?Not all butterflies and cheers and happiness, but right and real and beautiful and raw.The action, the suspense, the dramatic romance, the bittersweet ending… every moment and every page, every single word in this book.. EVERYTHING was perfect. I couldn’t have imagined a better ending for this series, I wouldn’t have it any othe
I also loved the ending for the lack of selfishness, for taking its time such that those souls could heal, for filling me with so many emotions.I am definitely giving away more than I want to, but for once I don’t care because I’ve been holding my breath the whole time waiting for Day and June to meet again, hoping for them to find a way back together, crying inside for all the things that have put a world of a wall between them, dropping my eyes into my mouth at some mind-blowing turnarounds and crying like a baby when things went terribly wrong.
Solid book. Solid ending. Solid trilogy.
I'M A MESS!MY HEART'S A MESS!!I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL!?!?!I'm so incredibly emotional right now I think I need some serious help...
I love her relationship with Day, and with Metias.
I felt like she was taking away from you all the things that I didn’t have.
Well done, Tess.Anden: Even though I ship Day and June, I also like Anden.
(view spoiler)[I especially liked how June dated him for a while, but they parted on good terms because they knew it couldn't work.
Even though some parts of the ending was illogical (view spoiler)[Ten years, and Day still hasn't gotten his memory back?
I am rating this 5 stars even though I had quite a few problems with it, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. There are a few things that I wish were tied up better and the ending was a bit frustrating at first, but I'm leaving this trilogy feeling satisfied.
You have GOT to be kidding me!! 2014?!?!?! After that ending? Oh hell no!
———beforeTHE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF CHAMPION I CAN'T. (x)----THE COVER IS SO BEAUTIFUL! I NEED TO READ THIS BOOK SO BADLY IT HURTS. ACCIO NOVEMBER! Nope? Nothing? *okay*--NOVEMBER 5th? Really?That feels like an eon away.It's weird but ^ this GIF hurts me more than any book release date ever could.
“Sometimes, the sun sets earlier. Days don’t last forever, you know. But I’ll fight as hard as I can. I can promise you that.” Are you familiar with the feeling of not knowing which book to read next, and not really wanting to, because there’s that sinking feeling in your stomach, that knowledge, that no other book will ever rival the one you just finished? That’s how I feel right now. Because, in all seriousness, Champion is perfection.There are only a handful of books that have received a fiv
You’ll finish the Legend series actually feeling like you grew up with Day, June, and the others, as the character development throughout the series is simply brilliant.Champion is the perfect ending to an amazing series—more than I’d dared to hope for, and certainly more than I’d ever expected—and I couldn’t have thought of a better way to wrap up the trilogy.Blog ¦ Bloglovin’ ¦ Tumblr ¦ Instagram
GENRE: YA/DYSTOPIAN/ROMANCE Champion is the anticipated last book in the Marie Lu's stunning dystopian Legend trilogy....and by the end it left me feeling a LOT like this... If you are thinking this will end 'happily ever after', think again. I mean, why would you even think that since ,like, 99.9% of dystopian books these days end up freaking tragically?I was screaming in my head. This.Cannot.Be.Happening.Again. All i want is a decent, happy ending to a good dystopian trilogy!Am i asking for t
Champion is the anticipated last book in the Marie Lu's stunning dystopian Legend trilogy....and by the end it left me feeling a LOT like this...
I mean, why would you even think that since ,like, 99.9% of dystopian books these days end up freaking tragically?I was screaming in my head.
Very caring, reckless, smart, and i would say an inspiring protagonist (much like June), but his love for his family was much stronger than that for his country.
But then we get the '10 years later' crap.(view spoiler)[And the last 2 sentences -"Hi, i'm Daniel.""Hi, I'm June." (hide spoiler)]And i'm all like "Bitch, what the f*ck is this sh*t?".
Book, you deserve to be hit over the head, nothing more, nothing less.(Link: http://vampirekiki.deviantart.com/art...)Note: I read the Chinese translation of this book, won't bother to pick up the English text.I would have given this book 2 or even 3 stars, if the warfare and the politic weren't handled in such a clumsy way *and* the ending hadn't turned out as ridiculous as this:(1) The Ending:(view spoiler)[(i) Day lost his memory, after the war he is viewed by all as a hero, he also gets a fresh start together with his younger brother (not to mention he is also free to date whatever girls he wants in his spare time), whilst June, the heroine, lost every single one of her family (even her dog), gets a broken love relationship and is still pinning after Day (who doesn't even remember she exists) AFTER TEN FUCKING YEARS.Yeah, how dare the heroine finds another love interest, finds happiness and has a fulfilling life without the hero!?(ii) How they managed to win the war, you ask?
I'm sad.And I really really really liked this book.
This ending was a little like Cassie Clare's Clockwork Princess: A sad happy ending.
And I REALLY liked the ending, but oh, it made me cry so much.
I think what June decided at the end was really noble, but I don't know, also a little coward?
AND YES, I think Day deserved the chance June got him, BUT BUT BUT--- *le cries again*All in all, I loved this book and I loved the series.
I think I'll be rereading it in a few years.
Final rating: 5/5 starsYou're gonna suffer, but you are going to be happy about it.- Ron, Harry Potter   “You once told me why you chose ‘Day’ as your street name,” she says firmly. She moves her hand so that it’s over mine, hiding the paper clip ring from view. The warmth of her skin against mine makes my breath short. “Every morning, everything’s possible again. Right?” (...)Finally, I take a deep breath. “Sometimes, the sun sets earlier. Days don’t last forever, you know. But I’ll fight as ha
It doesn't help that i cried last 10 percent (wait, when i think about it, i cried a lot of times in this book...which was unusual), but most important of all, this trilogy has (view spoiler)[ HEA  (hide spoiler)] ending.
I am just grateful i wasn't reading ending in public (hahahhaa cause that would suck considering i freaking cried like a baby (with sad and happy tears and stuff))....____________________________________________
“I can let go, if you don’t love me.”He says this as if he thinks I’m the stronger one.
(most of all June and Day), even secondary ones, and even those i tried not to like (like (view spoiler)[ Thomas (hide spoiler)]).
All that drama and feelings! It was really great. Uploaded with ImageShack.usMarie Lu has done a wonderful job taking June and Day from being two infatuated teens to full blown love. I am so very, very happy with this series ending.

Lu outdid herself in the feelings and plot department.Marie Lu has really grown as a writer, she portrays feelings on a much deeper level and her abilities to flesh out the subtle intricacies of June and Day's relationship have grown.
Champion no longer hinge on action scenes and June and Day interacting, it now had a plot and a growing sense of urgency.
I don't want to spoil the ending or points of tension for anyone but let me tell any of the die hard fans out there just this; There is nothing to be afraid of, buy this book and enjoy it!
what a way to end a series, oh man.
And anyway, let's specify, the fact that I had foreseen it doesn't mean I didn't love it through and through."Days don’t last forever, you know."No. What makes this book wonderful, once again, is the mesmerizing, vertiginous depth that Marie Lu bestowed on her marvellous characters.June and Day's relationship is so well-written and developed- so complex, so torn, so conflicted and, for these very reasons, so unbearably romantic and captivating.
