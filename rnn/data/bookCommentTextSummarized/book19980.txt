Nora gets a weird feeling from Patch, and things just keep going from bad to worse as Nora becomes convinced that she is being stalked, and may even be the target of murderous intentions.
Nora, understandably, had some trouble with this, and the result is a thoroughly frustrating heroine who jumps to insane conclusions based on inane evidence one moment, and the next goes blithely along into obvious danger.Patch is intriguing, and perhaps the most consistent character**, and I was fully prepared for an 'anti-hero as the hero' story.
How I Would Have Ended It*This post was inspired by the fantastic videos over at www.howitshouldhaveended.com. Italicized text is the original publicized text from the book and is entirely the work of Becca Fitzpatrick.This rendition is entirely satire. It is not meant to offend and I mean no discourtesy. I recognize that authors put a lot of time and work into their novels and I am not trying to disrespect that. Writing a novel is hard work and is something I have never done and I certainly don
It’s the rea­son I walked into your life.”I looked at him for a moment, his intense gaze shoot­ing through me as I con­sid­ered the infor­ma­tion he’d just confirmed.“Okay,” I said, straight­en­ing up and slip­ping out from his over­bear­ing pres­ence to put some space between us.“Okay?”“Okay, I’m out of here.”“You can’t go!” Patch said, his face twist­ing into a con­fused expression.“Well, you’ve pretty much admit­ted that you were going to kill me, in a very per­sonal way, might I add.
About three things I was absolutely positive:First, that Hush, Hush was, without a doubt, one of the worst Twilight rip-offs I've ever had the misfortune to read.Second, there was a part of me -- and I didn't realize how dominant that part actually was -- that insisted on reading Hush, Hush to the bitter end in the hope it would redeem itself.And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably wrong in that decision.
Let me give you a sample of my complaints (all of them would be longer than the allowed review space).This book reads as though someone read Twilight, appreciated the obviously marketable and profitable premise, and decided to rewrite it in an "edgier" way - which boiled down to clumsily asking a question, "What did Twilight lack?" and coming up with the answer, "Sexual creepiness bordering on sexual harrassment.
NOW BACK AWAY!!!!"** **But for some inexplicable reason Nora is in love with the creep.
Nora, you know what you need instead of a creepy boyfriend?
ARE WE EVEN READING THE SAME HUSH HUSH?I fell in love with Patch INSTANTLY I mean what's not to love?I also love Nora- She is such a refreshing and intriguing heroine.
Her and Patch suit each other perfectly.
They bicker like hell and it's so much fun to read.
I loved the twist in the end, it turned everything I thought was going to happen into something entirely different.
I never knew what was going to happen next.
I thoroughly enjoyed and loved this book and I certainly cannot wait to read the next.!
Let's see. My review/What I learned from this book:Well, I learned that it was a lot of fun to write! Enjoy the fall, all!
Later, Nora approaches her Bio teacher about switching her seat away from Patch because he makes her feel uncomfortable.
This all takes place right after Patch is seriously sexually harassing Nora in class, in front of the teacher and seemingly with the teacher’s encouragement.
The light turns yellow and Nora, ”…rolled to a stop, checked to see that traffic was clear, then pulled into the intersection.” What the hell?
Fitzpatrick could have written that the gashes started at his shoulder blades, and extended to his kidneys as they widened to form an upside down V.
I keep trying to dream run, but it's pretty fucking useless, because one of the guys catches up.
I'm still screaming with manic laughter as they take me down all these torchlit flights of stairs and I start getting pretty fucking scared, because I see all these shadows flitting around and little wispy lights and shit, and then I get locked in this cell, and we're back to medieval times with this one.
Yeah, the shadows and creepy things are back, and I'm pretty fucking freaked out by the time I reach this polished ballroom, that looks like it has laminate flooring, and big windows.

Some loved it, some liked it and some hated it. Now before I start my review I want to say that even that I heard a lot of things I was not spoiled or didn't even know anything about the
The story was quite predicted, like I could tell what will happen but for me it was a fun read and I seriously think that this book would have been better if it didn't have angels at all.____________________________________________“You're a guardian angel now." I was still too much in awe to wrap my mind around it, but at the same time I felt amazement, curiosity...happiness."I'm your guardian angel," he said."I get my very own guardian angel?
But even so, "Hush, Hush" managed to disappoint me.First, there are many similarities with "Twilight" - you have a regular average girl here, absent parents, a love affair with a dangerous supernatural boyfriend, a final showdown with a villain of his own kind.
You have everything for success here: a fabulous cover and font, and pages and pages of flirtatious banter filled with sexual innuendos (very often bordering on sexual harassment) fit for 30-year olds and not 10-graders.I am rarely for any kind of censorship of books, but reading nonsense like "Hush, Hush" makes me wonder: what are these writers thinking?
In my book, the relationship between Patch and Nora is not simply shallow, but dangerous.
But 30 pages of non-shittiness at the end of a 400 page book can’t redeem all the shittiness from the earlier pages.So, here’s what happens in this book.Nora: Some creepy transfer student is sexually harassing me.Patch: LOL, you know you want me.Nora: Fuck off, creep.Elliot: Hi Nora, I’m the complete opposite of Patch, and I’m your only alternative.Nora: I better go out with you so I don’t think about Patch.Patch: Come leave your perfectly normal date and ride on a rollercoaster with me even though you hate me.Nora: Okay.New school counsellor: Stay away from PatchNora: Okay.
I love a good vampire story as much as the next para-junkie, but I have to say I now have a major weakness for fallen angels as well.While I can understand some people making comparisons between this book and Twilight (dark, brooding hero, and a heroine who, against her better judgment, can't keep herself from being drawn into the hero's mysterious world).
But, in my own humble opinion, Hush Hush is a far superior book.
He's a full-on sexy badass, and I loved him to pieces.Here's hoping November comes quickly, so i can devour the 2nd book in the series.
It seriously disturbs me how many YA books romanticize men who make you feel unsafe (and abusive & controlling relationships in general).
All of these "he wants to kill me and scares me but also protects me so SWOON" books are getting out of control.
Not killing you should be the expected norm.This is like some bad Twilight spinoff with an even more pathetic main character who just doesn't know what she wants.
Like she goes to the biology teacher to request a new seating arrangement because Patch and his creepy comments/innuendo make her feel uncomfortable, so the teacher tells her to tutor him instead.
Pictures of this in the e-Zine would be all the evidence I'd need to get the board of education to ax biology."- Is it really necessary to introduce Vee with first and last name, especially as this is written from Nora's perspective?- Odds of a BoE getting rid of biology in any school curriculum are next to nil.
No teacher will condone, facilitate, or even allow the abuse Patch dishes out to Nora, and no teacher would not only refuse to make a simple change to ease a studen's mind but also lassoo said student into tutoring someone she is afraid of.Vee unlocked the doors to her 1995 purple Dodge Neon.- What is it with Fitzpatz and the year, model, and make of these beat-up old cars?
“If you can't feel, why did you kiss me?"Patch traced a finger along my collarbone, then headed south stopping at my heart.
But if I hadn't fallen, I wouldn't have met you.” “Hang on, did you just call me Angel ?” I asked.“If I did?”“I don’t like it.” He grinned.
Angel.”I really liked it!!!
I loved Nora and Patch, especially Patch but I have an objection.Why Patch?I don't like that name at all.Wtf?
Fallen angel named Patch?Anyway :P(view spoiler)[I was so confused at the beginning who was watching Nora and why they wanted to kill her.
swap out the vampires for fallen angels and add a brooding, kinda creepy and definitely weird love interest and thats basically ‘hush, hush’ in a nutshell.
this would have definitely been a 5 star rating had i read this back in high school.
it definitely gave me a nostalgic feel to the way the story was presented and was very reminiscent of the books i read as a teen.
this is perfect for those young at heart who are looking for a unique and fast-paced read!↠ 3.5 stars
No thank you.I don't care if he's an angel - he could work in a fucking soup kitchen 50 hours a week and he'd still be an asshole - Patch was a disgusting 'love interest'.
If you could even call him a love interest.
He takes advantage of her body and her mind, but it's okay, he's dreeeeamy.
I'm so tired of unhealthy relationships being portrayed as normal and okay - especially in YA.
And then, let's not forget that this was essentially Twilight with angels instead of vampires.
It's been almost 10 years since I read Twilight, but even after all this time the similarities were eeriily uncanny.But also:
Predictability, instalove, abusive and controlling behavior being glorified.
Not for me.The Story"A SACRED OATHA FALLEN ANGELA FORBIDDEN LOVE"Sounds awesome right?Patch is an overprotective (bordering on abusive) fallen angel.
Our "hero" tends to be a bit on the stalker-y/overprotective/abusive side of things and I do not feel like the issues with this behavior were ever really addressed.
I strongly feel like it is very dangerous for books like this to glorify and romanticize this type of behavior/situation.The target demographic for this book is young teenagers who are just starting to explore the idea of romantic love and sex.
Reading Hush Hush was like riding a roller coaster, the story moves in a fast pace and before you know it, it's over.
Like Patch describes her, she's attractive, intelligent and vulnerable.
Despite Nora feeling uncomfortable with Patch, she is drawn to him.
There is one part towards the end when everything seemed so surreal (hint: that part reminded me of Cassandra Clare's City of Bones), I wanted Nora to run and hug Patch.
I hereby declare Patch from Hush Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick my favourite YA guy.
Trust me, by the time you are done with Hush Hush, you'll be like Edward who?
“A book you say?”“Yes, it’s called Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick.”Dr. Chen nods.
“Now, why don’t you tell me how you came to be obsessed with this character Patch?”“Do you think it will help?”“I most certainly do!”I take a deep breath and tell him my story.*************************If I didn’t know anything about this book, I don’t think I would ever have thought that Hush, Hush was Fitzpatrick’s debut novel.
my eyes are crying out in pain because they had to suffer through 35 pages of this cringe filled garbage. yes, i dnfed at page 35, i don't hate myself enough to continue reading on. on page 20(?), after meeting our "love interest" for O N E D A Y, Nora feels an irresistible connection to him akdhskj fuck off, good night. also, Patch is a fucking creep. have a nice day.
Three words; hot, mysterious, heavenlyHush, Hush is one of those addicting reads.
hot, dark, mysterious and cocky as hell.
I love when I have such strong emotions toward characters, it's a compliment to the authors ability to make such a three dimensional character, and Fitzpatrick is right on!The plot was insane, twist upon twist, up until the final pages.
The pages inside are just as hot as the cover.
Fitzpatrick has a distinct story telling ability.
It seems she's able to tell the story effortlessly and all the while keeping the readers interest profoundly intact.I can't wait to read the next installment in this series!
At least, that's what she was until she met Patch.:)Yes, this story will definitely gives you the feels, especially between Patch and Nora.
*Evil Grin*But of course, you'll definitely be experiencing more than Patch's hands.
With the mysterious murder of Nora's father and these mysterious friends of Patch, this little romance is more than an average love story.
Let me just tell you that the cover of this book isn't just for show and tell.
This might just be someone we so dearly love.;)Maybe Patch isn't just a cute boy at school.Remember, keep this a secret.Hush, Hush.
Because Vee is also very noisy, she and Nora team up to find about Patch’s deep dark secrets.Around the same time Nora begins her investigation; strange things start to happen.
And Nora thinks she is going crazy because she swears she can hear Patch talking in her head.And again the sleuth that Nora is, where she has channeled Nancy Drew, goes to the library and begins to research fallen angels because of some strange V like scars on Patch’s back that are “angel wing scars”.
You can read my review from a long time ago below, though I would recommend reading other more cultivated reviews...Nora Gray is the typical over-achieving high school girl in the sense that she aims to go Yale, has a best friend, and has a somewhat dysfunctional family.
And Nora is about to experience her first taste of real danger in the delectable Patch Cipriano, the sexy, mysterious boy she finds herself sitting next to in biology class one morning.
I think it's important to get the point across that this book isn't a typical girl meets boy love story with a dark edge, it's much more than that.
“If you’re an angel, where are your wings?”  When you start the book, you will realize that it quite similar to Lux Series by Jennifer L. Armentrout and Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer. Only this time there are no vampires or aliens. This time the girl deals with angels.The premises and the characters are similar in these three series (Lux, Twilight and Hush Hush). A small town where everyone knows everyone. The local school. A girl with no many friends and with a single parent who is almos
A girl with no many friends and with a single parent who is almost no existent in her everyday life.Nora will be interested in the weird, extremely good looking boy in her class who (for some strange reasons) will become her class partner and they need to do projects together.Patch is a boy who is interested in Nora and not interested in Nora at the same time, who helps Nora and then intimidates her and who talks with riddles (ring any bells?).There are hot situations between them and cold situations between them.
Actually, if I think of it by Raphy and the Rape Culture View, Hush, Hush is what Patch always to shut up Nora so he could abuse her.
Because it’s dumb and isn’t supposed to make sense, and pictures!Instead, Becca Fitzpatrick was honestly trying for a serious story with serious bad boy tones and stalkers!
ME WANT, ME WANT.” And yet we don’t even know why the fuck she wants him and his ass.But yes, this is why I was feeling Fitzpatz’s tug on getting me to like this book.
RATINGS: 1 STAR Another book with a jerk as a hero and Mary Sue as a heroine with pathetic secondary characters and story. A twisted up version of Twilight which makes Twilight look better ( no offence Twilight fans, but I'm tired of this sh#t). I just want to forget that I ever read this book.
I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what I think about this book.
On one hand I read it in under 12 hours, so it definitely caught my attention, but on the other hand it almost repulsed me, because the "hero" was so unpleasant.
It's obviously aimed at teenage girls, but I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable letting a (hypothetical) daughter of mine read it until she was quite a bit older, precisely because the hero throughout the most of the book is threatening and manipulative.The book is well written however, and the characters real enough that you want to reach in and shake them for making such bad decisions.
Turns out there's a reason for it all though, and the author manages to tie all threads together very nicely in the end.
Este libro es un BIG FAT MEH. Un poco entretenido, pero solo eso. No es un mal libro, simplemente no me dejo con ganas de continuar la serie. Quizá algún día lo haga, quizá.
