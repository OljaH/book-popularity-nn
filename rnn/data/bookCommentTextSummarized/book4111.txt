Sicuramente non il migliore della serie. La trama troppo complicata toglie il piacere della lettura di un libro che si propone come svago e invece si trasforma in un puzzle.
Perry Mason escaped from the city to take a break from work only to meet a rich guy who wanted to consult him professionally.
It seems people making living by making work related to agriculture in pre-WWII US would laugh at the idea as ducks do not drown, even the dead ones.
I keep saying that when it comes to mysteries dealing with happenings in the past which continue influencing the present and people's skeletons in the closet Ross Macdonald is an unbeatable master.
It also broke a record in the amount of dead bodies for the series, if you count both past and present.
I loved the old TV series with Raymond Burr and the slightly newer ones featuring a much older Raymon Burr.
I like that the ebook format is allowing us to revisit a lot of older authors.
Often these older novels just don't stand the test of time but that isn't the case here.
Yes, the world has changed since the time this novel was written but it offers us a look into the way people loved before cell phones and the internet.
And yes, these are even better than the TV series.
I used to watch Perry Mason on TV, both the old and new series.
I enjoyed those programs so when I saw one of the books by Erle Stanley Gardner that were the source of the TV shows at a used bookstore, I decided to read it.
I see that Gardner wrote over 80 Perry Mason books between 1933 and 1973.
I have no plans to read them all but I did enjoy this story and so plan to read at least a couple more.
I may see if I can find the first and the last in the series.
I got confused with this one, the plotline was a good one but the ending and the reveal was poor.
Not to mention the constant cigarette smoking .
It was just a given that everyone smoked.
A wealthy blue-blood, John Witherspoon approaches Mason and asks him to look into the background of his daughter’s fiance, Marvin Adams.
Withersppon had hired detectives who contrarily learned the boy’s father had been convicted of murder and Witherspoon, overly genetically inclined, is sure those evil traits might have been passed down from father to son.
He wants Mason to read the trial transcript, see if the conviction was representative of the truth, and if so he will devise a test involving murder that will show Marvin’s true colors.
***1/2.Gardner somehow learned about the discovery and action of detergents and used that knowledge to form the basis of the plot for this mystery.
Gardner used their capability of lowering surface tension as the key point in his list of clues when a duckling was placed in a container of water containing a small amount of surfactant.
They duckling could no longer swim because the water would no longer support him.
This fact became the key clue to the identity of the killer.
This was a clever use of some new technology as a key part of Gardner’s plot device.
Ah, I needed this one.
From the Palm Springs start (in 1942 - the same year my mom graduated from Palm Springs High!) to the shenanigans in El Templo (hi, El Centro!), this was a wonderfully nostalgic read for me.
The characters were great, the mystery was a mystery right up to the grand unveiling, and Della Street continues to be a Boss.
And on another note, town names in the Perry Mason books continue to befuddle me.
Palm Springs is Palm Springs, but El Centro is El Templo?
Like Santa Monica is Bay City?
Why do some get name changes but not others?
Just another atypical typical Perry Mason story. Courtroom hysterics, more suspects than you can shake a duck at, and a duck that sinks.It is interesting to read a book, set in the present at the time of its writing that is instructive of new developments that we take for granted today. Detergents were something relatively new at the time, and not referred to in the same fashion as we would consider them today.And there was a drowning duck....sort of.
This one is fun, more complicated than many of the Perry Mason predecessors but also with a touch of humor.
Who knew?There are the usual problems -- all the women are sexy and attractive, for instance, even when they are not in their twenties,and Della and Perry may or may not have a romantic relationship.
They ride horses together, spend the night in a romantic inn and so forth.
The plot is a bit byzantine, and its solution comes more or less out of thin air and is a bit taxing on one's credibility.Still, fun, as I said above.
This exactly scratched the Pulp Hero craving I had.
It never slows down.
Perry Mason is bigger than life, and always working angles that no one else sees.
I thought his would be unreadable, but it flies by and never crossed the line of reality that would kick me out of the story.
Does the mystery hang together?
I have no idea.
I'm reading it for the style and a glimpse into a long gone age of fiction and history.
I got exactly what I wanted, hence the five stars.
Both things in older fiction that can ruin a story.
Quintessential Perry Mason!Gardener proves why he is the world's most read writer! An astute observer of humankind and a love for justice as can be meted out in a framework of the American judicial system sums up the story in broad strokes. All the players in this almost real life drama are brought to life flawlessly. I was figuring the touch of the drowning duck would be gimmicky but Gardener uses it for some lessons in Chemistry as well as an interesting pivotal point! Masterful and compelling!
Not one of the best Perry Masons. The interesting thing here is that Mason isn't the defense attorney in the case, at least at first. Of course, when he joins the team, he takes over completely. It's also interesting that Mason meddles with evidence, and this nearly lands him in trouble. Only some fast talk and some fast thinking allows him to avoid probable arrest. The main trouble here, though, is the convoluted solution to the crime. Goodness, it made my head spin.
Everything you like about MasonGood book based on a crazy premise. A duck that can't swim. I've read other Mason mysteries but like this one more. Has some of the usual law skirting antics. Lots of work for the Drake detective agency and of course Della keeps it all together. You won't be disappointed.
I think that using the words "granite hard" and "underwear" in the same paragraph is pushing the envelope, but Perry IS a man of action and he and Della ARE on vacation.
And it did work out like that, although the hard-drivers and their families paid a high price.The recurring theme is Perry Mason's deep conviction that a lawyer can only properly defend his client if he starts with the assumption that the client is innocent and deserving of full exoneration.
Perry's client is cleared, of course, but what happened to those servants and their jobs and their families?
The Drowning Duck is my second Mason, although a much earlier story than my prior.
As such, local court cases would get more face time.
Maybe I should go to Perry Mason for a hunch on lotto numbers too.
Oh...and Perry Mason is apparently a dog whisperer.So, the feeling is probably that I didn’t like this.
It might be a little far-fetched and certainly not as engaging as the last Mason (which was simply a slightly more plausible story).
This gets two stars purely because no Perry Mason belongs at higher than 4 stars and there needs to be some differentiation amongst Gardners's work.
Whiterspoon, an arrogant father asks Mason to investigate an old case involving the father of his to-be son-in-law.
Set in an era when detergent was a new discovery, a little scientific experiment of drowning duck performed by the son-in-law, Marvin, gave the murderer a way of making him the fall guy.As Mason studies the old crime, he finds that Marvin's father could have been innocent.
Meanwhile, the detective Whiterspoon had hired to initially find about old case is murdered in his apartment with a duck drowning in the fish bowl.
What caught my attention was the title of the book and how can it ever be related to a murder?!
By the time i finished, i was like , what ??The client, Mr. Witherspoon is a rich business man who considers Family as his priority.
He has a daughter Lois, who is madly in love with Mr.Marvin Adams who is the son of Mr.Horace Adams who was convicted of murder 18 years ago.
Witherspoon doesnt approve of their love and calls in Mason to investigate and convince his daughter to move on with life.
Will Lois marry Marvin?
What about the other murders that occured?
Sometimes Gardner likes to love things to the Southwest, or at least out in the California mountains and desert towns.
Lately, I've been readiing Gardner books where multiple wives or girlfriends are in the picture.
There's a war coming.
Having read past the 1940's I can say that Gardner skips over a lot of detail about the war.
Perhaps a sugar ration card appears, or cheaper tires, due to the war effort, but given what a defining event it was during the 1940's, Gardner has very little to say of it.
Maybe he say his books as escapism from that reality.
This was a quick and intriguing read.
I've only read a few books in the Erle Stanley Gardner.
It was an interesting story and although it was written almost 70 years ago, it seems almost timeless.
I thought the description of "detergent" was very funny, however, considering the advances of technology in our cleaning materials.
Overall it was a very entertaining story and was perfect for a long flight home.

#20 in the Perry Mason series. This humerous entry has the distinction of being the only mystery I'm aware of to use a surfactant as a major plot element. Perry winds up juggling timetables and ducks.Perry Mason series - Wealthy John L. Witherspoon hires Perry Mason to delve into a twenty-year-old murder case in order to prove that the young man Witherspoon's daughter intends to marry has homicidal impulses in his genes.
Jessas, kui segane saab üks juhtum olla. Aga põnev ka. Osa asju suutsin ma välja nuputada, kuid osades asjades suutis autor mind ikka tõsiselt üllatada.Leheküljel seitse oli ka üks vahva ütlus:"Igal inimesel, kes on elanud küllalt kaua, et olla midagi rohkemat kui lihtsalt ülikonnatäide, on elus mõni suletud peatükk. Kui mitte, pole ta ka inimene."
Content - This is how a mystery should be - lots of twists and turns and complicated details muddying things up and a dizzying list of possible suspects. Mechanics - The writing is not amazing but it passes very well. Squeaky Clean? - Murders and affairs and such are only referred to not dwelt on or described. A few bad words.
The first Perry Mason I didn't particularly enjoy. Part of the problem is that the whole case is about Mason investigating events that occurred twenty years earlier, so we lack the famous courtroom drama.
It's 1942, the United States is sending young men to war, and a "detergent" is a newfangled chemical handy for parlor tricks. Perry Mason even then was a headstrong man of action and justice was his quest.
This is the first book which I have started and finished the same day within a span of 8hrs with a few breaks in between. The story was really interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed the way the plot unfolds. Glad to have picked this up.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
A Super Suspenseful Perry Mason mystery...
A dead man in the kitchen, gas fumes permeate the house, a duck seem to be drowning in the fishbowl, but it didn't die. Maybe that fact has something to do with murder?
The case of the Drowning DuckGreat book. I really enjoy all of the Perry Mason cases. I hope they find more of Erle Stanley Gardner's books for the kindle.
