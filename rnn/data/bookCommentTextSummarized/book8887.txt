Najbolji francuski ljubavni istorijski roman napisan u prošlom veku... I posle toliko godina i dalje je jedan od najtraženijih u našim bibliotekama... U svetu su prodati milioni primeraka ovog serijala... Originalno ima 15 nastavaka... Kod 'nas' je prevedeno samo 9... Autorka sada ima već preko 90 godina... Deset godina se zakonski borila da od francuskih izdavača povrati autorska prava na svoje knjige...A mi se borimo da dobije prvo srpsko štampano izdanje... Držite nam fige... :)
One 80-year-old reviewer claimed it was the best book she'd ever read.
And more than one person loudly announced, "Ignore the cover art!"I was more than a little intrigued.Angélique is the first in a series of books, though not all of them were translated into English.
The writing is well done, the characters are well developed, the storytelling is compelling, and the historical detail is superb.Though I wouldn't go so far as some reviewers and claim that it is life-changing or the best book I've ever read, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this epic tale.

Koloritno, razvijena radnja i likovi, napeto, istorijski period odlično oslikan, dijalozi inteligentni, opisi veoma bujni i atmosferični. Svideo mi se dodatak u vidu raznih istorijskih ličnosti.Jednostavno ne mogu da pronađem ikakvu značajniju zamerku. Između četvorke i petice i jedna velika preporuka (neka vas dužina ne zaplaši, knjiga se čita brzo, pa težina očas posla pređe iz jedne ruke u drugu).
There are scenes that look to have been included for the titillating value they provide rather than plot necessity, which take away a lot from the writing.
As for plotting, the Golons could've done without prolonging the tribulations near the end, and the cliffhanger ending whose outcome isn't difficult to puzzle out.Nonetheless, comparatively speaking this novel is better plotted and better written than many others in the same category.
It doesn't take long for Angélique to find a man of gold underneath the dross and it's true love forever - that is until some evil baddies plot against Joffrey and…Well, I can't go much further without spoiling, but our heroine finds herself in a battle for her life, as well as the lives as her two sons and she eventually sinks as low as she can get.
The edition I read had about 800 pages, so if you've something that is in the 400 range, you are missing a book between this and the next in the series, Angélique and the King.
Of all the novels, I have read in my life, this is the book I always come back to as the book that gave me a love of reading.
Love, passion, adventure, mystery, intrigue, villians, heroes, and a headstrong woman ahead of her time who you will fall in love with.
The writing style is superb and as you will get lost as you follow the adventures of Angelique from a young girl into motherhood in her quest to find love.
A truly amazing set of novels that is tragically out of print, even though it has been translated into over 40 languages!
I was 15 when my late Mother recommend this collection of light erotic French naughtiness with the Forever Amber style wit . A forgotten classics that that are difficult to find these days. These books of 13 are like Dennis Wheatley's Rider Brooke or The Poldark series & if you can find them there fun
I first read the first three books when I was 8, and I thought this was the most amazing, entertaining, edge-of-your-seat story that I would ever encounter in my life.
The heroine of the book, Angelique, is beautiful, brave, intelligent, witty, charming, and the list goes on and on.
I have not read all 15 novels (just the first 5), but know enough to say that they do get a little "ridiculous" towards the end, but they never cease to be exciting and fantastic.
And you know what?
Kroz njeno odrastanje u zamku, autorica pred nas stavlja čitavu lepezu narodnih predanja, seoskih svadbenih običaja, te dašak pomodarstva primamljivog života pariških plemića i velikodostojnika.Anđelikinu svakodnevnicu ispunjavaju dječije razonode sa pastirom Nikolom i mlinarevim sinom Valentenom, sve do dana kada iznenadni dolazak dalekog im rođaka markiza od Plesi – Belijera i njegovog nadmenog sina Filipa, zauvijek ne promjeni sudbinu porodice Sanse.Našavši se između bijesa koji u njoj budi izrugivanje ponašanju njene porodice i divljenja svoj toj, ponekada i preko mjere, ukrašenoj odjeći i manirima u skladu sa dvorskom etiketom, Anđelika će biti prinuđena da pripitomi svoju impulzivnu narav zarad interesa cijele porodice.
I love this Series and anyone who does not take the opertunity to read them is missing out in an adventure that will take you from 17th century France to the shores of the Maine Wilderness , from Kings to ,Sultaqns , to Pirates and Indians, not to mention the tangle of religions .
The trials and intrigues, of a young girl to a great women of the courts where even the king found her the most beautiful.
Husbands Killed , Sons lost , and more adventure than you will ever find while falling under the spell of Angelique.
A major 10 stars for this complete series .....
Isto sam mislila i ja, ali, kao tinejdžerka sam ipak dala šansu knjigama i bukvalno ih "progutala", naučila mnogo više o istoriji Francuske nego iz udžbenika, zaljubila se u Pariz....i ponovo ću čitati sigurno, čim nađem vremena.Angelique de Sance je jedno od mnogobrojne dece siromašnog francuskog plemića, koji od nekadašnje porodične slave ima jedino još ime i uglednu rodbinu koja ga posmatra s prezirom.
Priča opisuje Anđelikino odrastanje u porodičnom seoskom zamku, slušanje dadiljinih predanja o prošlosti kraja i čitave zemlje, maštanje o bekstvu u Ameriku, tumaranje okolnim šumama sa najboljim drugom Nikolom...Prilikom jednog okupljanja plemića, u posetu im dolazi i markiz, rođak njenog oca, sa ženom i sinom Filipom, koji je lep kao lutka, ali, uobražen i bezobrazan, pa će ismejati jadnu devojčicu koja se beznadežno zaljubila.
The formal, poetic language because it was a translation (something I didn't really appreciate at the time) and the extremes of poverty and richness, countryside and the court...Angelique's growth from self-centered teenager to mature woman, all of it stayed with me.The series itself is never content to stay static.
Never would've predicted that.I've lost count of how many times I reread this series.
It's epic and Angelique...now that's what I call a heroine.
When she becomes the Rebel and rouses the countryside up against the king...wow.She's beautiful and everyone desires her, yes, but she's emotionally and physically scarred and feels very real.
Angelique isn't a bad story for its history and French culture, but the romance part was rather disturbing. Angelique, the main character, is twelve years old and getting it on with adult men. It's a little too creepy for me, even if that kind of thing was acceptable during the book's time period. O_o
I really can't remember when was the first time I've read this book, all I know I was probably to young because it took me a little more time and rereading it to understand why the hell are all women so mad about Joffrey.
Still, I absolutely loved the first book, and ultimately the rest of the series.
Although the writing has lost a bit of its original appeal for me, if I ever have daughter I'll probably buy the books, forbid her ever to read them and then sit back and enjoy as she reads the books in secret and falls in love with Angelique.
Angélique's father, who has these very same responsibilities along with having to look after numerous children of his, is approached by a mysterious but enterprising man called Molines who proposes to solve his monetary issues by helping him with his mule business at a time when it was frowned upon for nobility to be seen engaging in toil and hard work as living beyond their means in extravagant follies was much more the fashion of things.
For one thing we begin to get an idea of why Molines would bother engaging in business with a poor nobleman who he has to constantly help in money matters.
только пять звезд я могу поставить - потому что не было для меня в моем подростковом возрасте более влиятельной книги, чем анжелика.
но с 10 до 15 лет - вот они, мои университеты.
благодаря ей я научилась произносить французские слова и ставить ударение на последний слог - и это были первые шаги к образованию в французской филологии.
отсюда мои первые впечатления о париже, да и вообще моя точка отсчета для всего французского - скажем, короля из "трех мушкетеров" я в первую очередь числю за отца "анжеликиного короля".
а также - это книга, которая воспитала меня в русле феминизма.
This is a totally amazing series of books.
Regrettably the covers lead one to believe it is a raunchy series but the depth and scope of historical fact interwoven with fiction is amazing.
It is the story of a young french girl of impoverished nobility who is married off to a french Count who wants the land that is part of her dowry.
This interesting insight came from The World of Angelique's website ""When she is writing a scene, she lays the characters out on a table so she always knows where they are.
Months later, I read an article in a 1964 edition of Paris Match (very appropriately) that describes these very same matches/characters."" From the same website ""Anne Golon has just completed rewriting the first two AngÃ©lique books to reinsert vital passages that were expunged from the first edition to create an 'author's cut', had finished an AngÃ©lique film script, and is putting the final touches to the 14th and penultimate AngÃ©lique book.
Too soon involved in the intrigue and lawlessness rife in seventeenth century France, Angelique is married to the sinister Comte de Peyrac.
Rich and powerful, holding the key to some of the deepest mysteries of science, he arouses her body and mind and makes her Queen of his Court of Love at Toulouse.
Angelique enters a life of sublime ecstasy - an ecstasy soon to be shattered by her husband's enemies Imprisoned by the Inquisition and tried for witchcraft, the Comte is sentenced to death.
Rich in historic detail, suspense and with a wonderful love story, I devoured this series once I'd found it.
memories memoriesI was around 11 when I discovered this series. I became totally obsessed when I was a teen :)
The characters were amazing, unique, completely fascinating.
I sobbed at parts, my heart raced at others, I was so utterly and completely invested in these characters.
The covers of these books (written in 1962, translates from French, and reprinted a few times with different publishing companies through the years) look like an old time cheesy romance novel.
It's an excellent historical novel, a love story, a character study, and much more.
It's true you can't judge a book by its cover!
Lucky for me and other fans, Angelique is a series of several books about the title character, the charming and spirited Countess Angelique (de Sance) de Peyrac.
A wonderful series, I read them all, a huge adventure and wonderful characters. A timeless series. The films were also wonderful.
New Editions debacle, I'm not sure what I've actually just read, but I suspect the old one bc it was still part of a 13-book series.]OK, so the thing is, this series is, like, Gone with the Wind's pretty French cousin.
even MORE gross non-con that's made me drop the book at least once - but on the flip side, has the same strong core in the form of a brave, LIKEABLE AS HELL, rebellious heroine as opposed to Strong Female Characters of nowadays.
Remember reading this while frying on the beach in St Tropez 1980...ish
Sergeanne Golonin Angelika on oivallista luettavaa historiallisen romantiikan nälkään! Kuvankaunis Angelika seikkailee 1600-luvun Ranskassa, hurmaa miehiä, selviää pinteestä toisensa jälkeen sinnikkyytensä ja oveluutensa avulla. Nopean tapahtumatahdin ansiosta tylsää hetkeä ei tämän kirjan parissa tule!
my new guilty pleasure reading books that were racy when i was 11-14. they are so tame but fun in a weird sort of way
The writing is literary while remaining flowing, the style is often striking for the senses - you can see and feel the atmosphere as if you were at Angélique's side, but at the same time emotional depth and characters psychology is central in the book (and the series more generally).
But the first strength of this novel is its story, a beautiful, strong and different love story blended with a tale of treason, plots and politics.
The novel blends many styles and the elements of historical drama are actually more present than the romantic ones even if Angélique's love story is at the heart of the series...
However, she will come to learn that no one is safe from the antipathy of courtiers and clerics.While I enjoyed some of the characters, such as Joffrey de Peyrac, I had some difficulties with Angelique herself, I'm sorry to say, and felt that the attitude towards women in the book was rather dated (unsurprisingly, of course, since it was written in 1957).
Personally I am not hugely enthused to read the rest of the series, although I say once again that probably if you are fonder of the historical romance genre than I am, you will enjoy this much, much more than I did.
E' vero che la ricostruzione storica è minuziosa, ma mi sembra che abbiano messo in mostra un po' troppo le loro conoscenze, facendo risultare il romanzo come una lezione di storia.
Mascherandolo da romanzo d'amore, anche piuttosto erotico, tenendo presente l'epoca in cui è stato scritto, volevano probabilmente tenere una lezione di storia al target di persone a cui il romanzo era destinato.
In realtà, se lo leggessero, si renderebbero conto che questo non è un romanzo d'amore, né un romanzo erotico, ma un vero e proprio ritratto fedelissimo della Francia di Re Sole.
