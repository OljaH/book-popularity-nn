Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
= Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
is a play by Edward Albee first staged in 1962.
It examines the breakdown of the marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George.
The title is a pun on the song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" from Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf.
I have to invent a new word after this play: sadvicious. As in, sad and vicious, ineluctably intertwined, till death do them part. There's also the wicked humor of the play, for which I don't have a new word, a heartbreaking hilarity that keeps pace with the emotional maelstrom. This is an absolutely brilliant work.
This, of course, stands in stunning contrast to Martha, who comes across as the earth mother - but in reality is incapable of having children.George comes across as a pathetic creature at the start of the play, unable to satisfy his wife who considers him so ineffectual that she doesn't even pretend to hide her flirtations with other men – but by the end we realise that he has completely controlled all of the action in the entire play and everything that has happened has happened due to his choices and his decisions.
More than this, everything that happens, happens due to his great love of Martha – something that seems incomprehensible at the start of the play as they are tearing strips off each other.I went to see this play a year or so ago and was almost reduced to tears towards the end.
A three-act play about the illusions that sustain two couples, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf follows the aging George and Martha as they entertain and terrorize the recently married Nick and Honey one night after the end of a university faculty party. The evening starts off on an unpleasant note in the former couple's home, and the situation only further deteriorates as the increasingly intoxicated small group stumbles toward dawn. Albee's acerbic wit is at its strongest here, and in contrast to many of his plays, the plot rarely feels tedious or drawn out.
I don't often read plays but I absolutely loved Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for its cinematic, almost comedic style, it's colourful characters and its timelessness. Definitely a classic that everyone should read.
“There's no limit to you, is there?” Edward Albee, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?This review is not for Edward Albee's brilliant play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but for the equally brilliant recording of the original cast with Uta Hagen.
A recording of the play’s original cast, featuring the great Uta Hagen and Arthur Hill, was re-released in 2014.
All that’s needed are four great actors, and the four who starred in the debut production give performances that, even some 50 years later, still feel fresh, fierce and definitive.No one will ever outshine Hagen’s Martha.There’s something particularly satisfying about hearing the performance.
I finally saw this the other night. It was fun to watch, although by 'fun' I often mean painful and awkward. This is a long social faux pas taken to its most uncomfortable extreme, and I often had to look down just from being so embarrassed at watching what was happening.(view spoiler)[The final twist seems vaguely implausible at first glance, but then I've had people lie to me about more implausible things than having a child. (hide spoiler)]
Holy smokes, this was hard to put down. It's riveting, a little vile, and dramatic to say the least. I'm so excited to talk about it in class this week. I'll probably come back and review it more properly then. Needless to say, this was excellent.
This is, in my opinion, the best play ever written in the 20th century.
It's basically about two married couples who hang out in the wee hours of the morning following a party on a college campus in New England, but the interesting part is the way one couple tries to screw with the other's minds for their own personal enjoyment.
By the way, like many plays, it's not the greatest "read"; to really do it justice, you have to see it perfromed.
This play is so fucked. I don't know whether it's genius or madness. Probably both.
This falls under that category labelled AWKWARD SOCIAL GATHERING.You ever been to a party where the host and hostess get totally hammered and spend the rest of the evening humiliating each other?
Oy.In any case, watching it again made me realize I never read the actual play all the way through, though occasionally we'd be assigned monologues from it in my theater classes, or I'd have to sit through people performing scenes from it from time to time.
It's very complicated that way, but overall it makes you never want to attend a social gathering ever again.Probably makes you think twice about hosting one too.
E così Martha e George litigano ancora una volta, si odiano con tutta la forza di cui sono capaci, si maltrattano e coinvolgono in questo spettacolo i loro nuovi amici, che da spettatori diventano loro malgrado attori, rubano le loro debolezze deridendole e scoccando frecce mortali anche per loro per poi scoprire alla fine che un grumo di dolore può avvelenare una vita, due e lasciarla senza più ragione.
Martha e George si appartengono, nel dolore e nella sofferenza e per questo si uccidono mille volte.

با وجود این‌که ما موجوداتی اجتماعی هستیم اما در شرایط خاصی ممکن است کاملاً غیراجتماعی بشویم.
اما می‌دانم که اجتماعی بودن، متشخص بودن و رفتارهای همراه با شعور ممکن است تا جایی همراه‌مان باشد و بعد در وضعیتی ویژه تغییر کنیم.
آدم‌های این نمایشنامه البته فقط تا جایی و تنها چند قدمی از آن چهره‌های خندان با نور ملایمی از شعور اجتماعی دور شدند.
ممکن است ما هم یک روز در حضور مهمانان‌مان چنین کارهایی انجام بدهیم.
این آدم‌ها را احتمالاً نمی‌شود به راحتی هر جایی پیدا کرد.
شکستن مرزها شاید برجسته‌ترین ویژگی این نمایشنامه برای من باشد.
I think I'm still processing, but WOW! "We all peel labels, sweetie; and when you get through the skin, all three layers, through the muscle, slosh aside the organs [...] and get down to bone...you know what you do then?[...] When you get down to bone, you haven't got all the way, yet. There's something inside the bone...the marrow...and that's what you gotta get at.”
من خیلی از این نمایشنامه تعریف شنیده بودم.انتظار یک شاهکار رو داشتم ولی متاسفانه !!
بیشتر از دو ستاره نمیتونم بدم .چهار شخصیت داستان به طرز غیر قابل باوری خوب درنیومده بودن و من از همشون متنفر شدم.
کارهاشون به شدت اگزجره داشت.
نمیدونم هدف نویسنده بوده این اگزجره شدن یا نه !!
به هر حال برای من خوشایند نبود.یک زوج جوان مهمان یک زوج میانسال میشن.
کالجی که پدر زن میانسال مدیر اون هست.
زوج جوان ساعت ۲ صبح میرن خونه اشون و زوج میانسال تا صبح به هم فحش میدن و همو مسخره میکنن جلوی زوج جوان !!
نهایتا لازمه بگم خیلی ترجمه جالبی هم نداشت😐
This play makes me squirm with discomfort every time I read it. My mother raised me to be so conscious of manners that I'm practically Southern. Even though George and Martha are just horrible, I can't help cackle at some of the insults they sling. When Martha says that George doesn't have "the stuff," my English Major heart is made happy. It's a totally perfect slam.And who could not admire Albee's daring in using the term "monkey nipples"?
---"What a dump!" Thus begins a most entertaining Albeography. The language shocked prissy critics in the early 60s. There's a lot of drinking, shrieking and insulting. Another play in which 2 couples snarl at each other and you wonder why someone doesn't say, "OK, we're going home!" But, if this was said, there'd be no play.
Un inferno fatto di odio che spurga da ferite vecchissime, un inferno di cattiveria e follia e perdita di ogni ritegno.Quando si legge una sceneggiatura di un'opera teatrale l'esperienza è sempre, per forza di cose, parziale e incompleta, limitata e limitante, eppure questo è uno dei casi in cui ho sentito proprio poco la mancanza della controparte scenica.
The song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? was featured in the Disney short film  Three Little Pigs  (1933), where two of the pigs are convinced they're safe from the wolf in their straw and twig houses.In Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, George and Martha return home from a party with a younger couple, Nick and Honey, and end up downing a drink or two or ten during the night. Nick and Honey can't seem to drag themselves away from the revelling that seems more like a surreal nightmare of funhous

Long before the shock revelation at the end, the mood becomes increasingly oppressive, and the ominous hints thrown here and there confirm that George and Martha aren't just a middle-aged couple who want to drive each other insane for the heck of it.With all their spiteful screeching, they turn into a big gust of wind that blows the straw and twig house down.
به عنوان شاهكار ازش ياد شده ولي از نظر من خواننده ي عام چرند و بي معني بود. خاصه با ترجمه ي حال بهم زنش كه مثل شكنجه بود. كه اغلب ترجمه ي نمايشنامه ها اين ويژگي رو دارن بحمدالله.
The central theme of this play is living without pretense. It involves 4 characters (and you will hate each of them) who berate each other through three acts. People have always raved to me about it, but I must admit that I can't understand why - rather than being emotionally jarred and on-edge, I felt bored and irritated. Every character is so villianized that there is no "heart" to the play, not a single character one can relate to. It's an interesting piece of literature, but it's definitely not my all-time favorite.
I am not sure whether the relationship between Martha and George is highly dysfunctional or highly functional.
As their games go on, instead of exposing themselves (how does one expose oneself when one already lives outside oneself?), Martha and George end up exposing the fragilities in the relationship between Honey and Nick.And the ending… Ah, the opposite of love is indeed indifference.
George and Martha know that well.“I said I was impressed, Martha.
I do feel like I need to see this being performed soon.P.S. As weird as this might sound, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf reminded me of an episode of The X-Files.
Season 6 Episode 6.
Just in the diction and grammar, I find you can always tell when you're reading a play as opposed to a novel (or watching a movie based on a play -- Jack Goes Boating, another two-couple disaster tale, being a perfect example).
Plays have a unique magic to them, when done right -- and the awkwardness of live performance is a huge part of that.So -- read all the reviews about how this play deconstructs the American dream and the American family and the 1950s, period.
No other medium would drive the pain, anger, and fear home quite as hard.
and I am unalterably opposed to it." (36)I had previously wanted to read Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but without a particular sense of urgency - until it was mentioned in a commentary on Strindberg's plays.
Apparently, Albee was influenced by Strindberg; intrigued, I immediately ordered a copy, and ended up reading Albee's play in almost a single sitting.
Powerful and mesmerizing (in the sense of hardly allowing you to avert your gaze), funny and also terribly sad, it felt like a mixture of Sartre's No Exit and, indeed, Strindberg's The Dance of Death, yet nonetheless containing something quite unique.
I will be reading more of Albee's plays in the future.
4.5* This play about a dysfunctional couple reads almost as well as it plays on stage. I have seen the film version with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (more than once) & I kept hearing their voices while I was reading.
There are simply no words.
Back and forth, back and forth, a husband and wife bicker.
If you like watching verbal arguments take place for hours at a time (more than hours, in book form), then this is the play novelette for you.SPOILER:It wasn't so much the characters that bothered me, or why they were arguing, it was just the arguing itself.
There are no admirable qualities that tie you to any of the characters except for the pity and even condescension you feel towards them.
I wish I had picked another play instead of being trapped with only this book to read for three hours.
I'm admittedly a little biased as I played Nick in a production of this, but Edward Albee is one of the truly great playwrights of the 20th century and this is one of his masterpieces.
In fact, the play is a lot of things, including difficult to read/watch as a number of people have already said.
A ferocious love story that's as mean and brittle and baffling as anything put on stage in the last 50 years.Some people will definitely hate it.
But try to see a good production of first if you can before reading it--the effect will be *much* stronger, guaranteed.
