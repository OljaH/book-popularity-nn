I read this hilarious book in 2015. That was the same year Steve Harvey announced the wrong winner at the Miss Universe pageant. That doesn't have anything to do with this book, but I watched that moment on repeat like eighteen times.
I'm not one to gleefully let loose on a book and tear it apart, but there are times when I feel so frustrated with the time spent on reading something, it's almost impossible to hold it in.
He spends a few minutes loving them like they're deluxe cheeseburgers after a night of binge drinking.His voice is hot and sweet and hard; a Werther's Original sitting on a radiator.
To the point that it actually became the theme of the story more than the supposed real plot of the book.
Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save the book for me, it was a complete miss this time around.
★★★★ 1/2! Pucked, book 1 of 5. Steamy one-night stand with ice-hockey manwhore turns sexy, funny, romance & slight obsession with monster cock!   “I can’t wait to have my mouth on you again.

My mom sits at the table and leafs through one of the gossip rags she loves to read while she sips a cup of coffee.“I think they made Buck look way worse here than he really is, don’t you?” She turns the magazine around so I can see the horrible pictures of my stepbrother.
Anyway, we’re flying out early in the morning, so I need to be prepared for Monday before I leave for the weekend.”“Can’t you work on it while you’re there?”“My mom wants to go shopping, so I’m not sure how much free time I’ll have.
4 stars I haven’t laughed this much while listening to an audio book in a while. Granted, a lot of the humor was immature and a little on the raunchy side, but still- very funny.

If you love sports romances and you love to laugh, THIS is a book you need to read!Violet Hall meets Alex Waters while going to a hockey game to see her step-brother, Buck, play.
Alex is the crazy good looking, playboy with a reputation, and team captain.
Alex isn’t exactly what she thought he was.
There was also lots and lots of sexy times.I love hockey books.
If you’re looking for a book with lots of humor, tons of steam, fun characters and a heartwarming story- pick this one up!

If you date a hockey player, raise your glass.If you don't, then raise your standards.4 Dibs on the PUCKING Captain STARSAlex and Violet ♥
So Helena Hunting please consider writing a continuation?
another plus to date a hockey player (I JUST WANT ALEX THOUGH).His beard is neatly groomed,unlike some of the other guyswho look like they crawled out of thealleyway and decided to play professional hockey.At so many points I literally LOL'D ..
at points I was like NO how can I continue on these notions are ridiculous and I really wanted to rate this lower stars.

*****FIVE STARS***** He’s such an enigma. I want these glimpses of sweetness and his awkward fumblings to be authentic, not a façade he wears to get women into bed with him. I don’t know why I waited so long to read this series and what possessed me to read the books out of sequential order. Even though you really can read each book as a standalone (except for Forever Pucked), because every installment is about a different couple, but all of the characters show up in each subsequent story. I hav
I have loved every book that I have read so far!
(i.e. Jilling, and Area 51) You’ll have to read this book to find out what they refer to!!Alex Waters is the Captain of the Chicago Hawks NHL team.
The two meet at one of the Hawks away games when Alex slams into the plexiglass barrier that Violet’s seated behind.
The way that he feels for Violet and all the things he does to care for her just solidified Alex as being a member of my top ten favorite book boyfriends list.
Pucked is a unique, deliciously hot, endearingly sweet, laugh out loud, good time romance! Already reread twice :))
4.5 starsI've been wanting to read Pucked for a long time, and I'm so happy that I finally did! It was the perfect read for me right now! Sweet, silly, and steamy af!! I loved it! ❤
How do you make an age appropriate explanation of why it's so funny that her mum walks in to her room as she is "jilling" (who went up the hill with Jill...a thing guys like doing...an action that ends with off) herself?
Pucked ended up being my own little giggle, snort party.Violet lives in the pool house on her mum and stepdad's property.
Alex does have a brain malfunction later on in the story, but it wasn't bad enough to reduce my like...lust...love for him.If you're looking for a very lighthearted, funny romance that's a little silly and a lot goofy Pucked is perfect.
Post-night of orgasmic magic, Alex starts to call, and text, and e-mail and send extravagant—and quirky—gifts, making him difficult to ignore, and even more difficult not to like.The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn’t want to be part of the game.
I didn't know that the words monster, cock and beaver could annoyed me so much but here we are and that's how it was.Guys, I tried and you know I like my hockey players but this book was not what I was expecting and I feel like I wasted my time.
For me, it was like there was no actual story, just bad sex scenes.
I didn't like Violet from the beginning, she just seemed really judgmental, especially of hockey players.
I feel sorry for him; as much as I've grown to like him over the past five years, he got the short end of the intellectual fortitude stick
Alex wasn't what I was expecting either.
He wasn't alpha or sexy in any way for me.
He wasn't sure of himself at all, and he was a little too stalkerish and clingy.
It is during one of these walk ins, Violet is manipulated into doing the family thing of supporting Buck at his first away game with the Hawks.
They were drawn like two moths to a flame in that look...making Violet's lady bits remember what excitement was supposed to be.Fast forward to meet and greet after the game...somehow these two connect again outside and a startling conversation happens between them stripping Violet of her usual walls...You see Alex is not like all other Hockey players...into the game and that is it...no, Alex is smart, has a degree in English Lit and noticed Violet brought and read her Fielding book while at the game.
3,5 Steamy Stars One wild night changes the lives of Violet and Alex.
Used to be a single girl by now, Violet doesn’t know what to do when mawhore anti-commitment Alex decided to chase her after their one night-stand.
Can Alex show Violet how good they could be together?
If you’re looking for a funny and steamy reading, with heartwarming moments a sexy Hockey player, this is the book for you.
Characters Development:  Violet was sassy and funny In the beginning, but soon those traits started to wear off and without anything else to stand for she just became annoying.

"I'm so pucked. There'd better be a support group for hockey hookers. I'm going to need it after tonight." After reading Pucked, I realize that the title could not be more indicative of how I feel about this series. I am truly Pucked! And it feels good! Helena Hunting's text is loaded with humor and wit, colorful characters, sports action, and smoking hot sex! When you are looking for the sweetest kind of escape, what more could you be looking for? "As the lone female among the throng of giant
After a fast game and some post-game celebration, Violet meets the captain of the team Alex Waters!
Although her protective stepbrother Buck isn't happy with the meeting, she has no problems spending one night with the hot hockey star.
As Violet and Alex get to know each other, they realize that their compatibility factor is off the charts.
Alex is a perfect hero for Violet.
Alex and Violet are quite entertaining and I am dying for more PUCKED goodness!
The blend of hockey, smoking hot sex, and colorful characters are sure to keep me coming back for more.
Basically it all comes down to 81 mentions of the word "beaver" or a close incarnation.
Oh, and 53 mentions of "monster cock" or "MC" for short.
That's a whole lot of repetition for a book that doles out a meager amount of character development and awkwardly mumbles over the big time conflict of the story.
I will give serious kudos to some righteous strip scrabble action because that did manage to make things better for awhile.I liked this but never really felt it.
Still this is a cute, sexy take on some NHL action and it was most definitely worth the time
I'm super duper late to this party, but I'm going to binge read this series and catch up.
LOLI’ll try my best not to belabor the reviews, but I already know I’m going to love the books so much.
Funny, sexy, and sweet.
He’s a known manwhore and she’s dead set against dating another athlete.
I love women who know what they want and go after it with gusto, regardless of the potential backlash.
She’s secure in her sexuality and doesn’t apologize for being a sexual creature.
If funny, sexy, and sweet are your jam, this one is for you!
This novel has it all.
Pucked is without the doubt the most entertaining adult contemporary story I have had a pleasure of reading.
But contrary to other adult books, they are never boring, repetitive or taken too seriously in this novel.
Aim of this story is to entertain, and entertain it did.Would I recommend this novel?
What I find funny, you do not have to.
But for me, Pucked will forever be my top favorite funny book ever written.
So answer is yes, I do recommend this novel.
Reading Is My Breathing
I somehow got my review for this book stuck on a French Kindle edition.
It was only a couple of sentences, but still.
I'm just putting this out there, so you know why you may have already seen me review this before.
lolI've been wanting to read Pucked for a long time, and I'm so happy that I finally did!
I devoured it any chance I got.
They have to be one of my favorite couples ever!
I wanted to highlight the whole book, because almost everything that came out of their mouth was gold!
The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it ended!
I have to, 'cause that's were I'm reading my smutty stuff these days and it's always at peril from either spraying tea on it from laughing so hard or (if the book is bad) wanting to chuck it out the window, the poor thing).Anyway, expect a fun as fuck, crazy-ass, slightly ridiculous yet oh so piss your pants funny book about this crazy chick called Violet, the hot as HELL Canadian NHL player she falls for (who actually ends up being a total sweetheart).
:)Overall, this book will either annoy the shit out of you, or you will be entertained by it's LOL moments.
Was I supposed to like this book...?I'm sorry but this was an absolute, boring, empty-chemistry mess. No redeeming quality whatsoever. Hope the next one is better...
DNF at 45% SADLY! The hockey scenes rocked; the flow and flawless writing was great. However; there was no real story or character development. Also; the cheesiness and childishness of the heroine made our eyes roll. The hero was a contradiction and don't get us started on the repetitiveness of beaver, monstrous cock and other sexual connotations and innuendos. Such a shame as we were really looking forward to this one. By the looks of it we are in the minority so please give this one a go yourselves!

*fans self*  This story follows Violet, who's sworn off hockey players after getting her heart broken, and Alex who's the incredibly sexy captain of her stepbrothers hockey team.
Violet goes to one of the home games with her parents to support her stepbrother and then meets Alex at the bar.
But Alex isn't like that and tries to pursue a relationship with her.
"This ridiculousness right here-" I kiss her-"is why I want to spend the rest of my life with you."Her hands come over mine, her smile full of tenderness and love.
to wtf kinda shit is this stars ....
What's What  There's no real plot here aside from a hockey dude wooing and groveling his way to love with the most spastic FMC I've ever read...
It starts off funny in an 'OMG can this chick be for real ' kinda way.
Sorry, but despite the occasional laugh, like the dick superhero scene, uhm, Violet isn't so likable.
"It's an orgasm in my mouth." "Sorry I shouldn't have said that."  My alpha hockey player fantasy just doesn't say that kinda shit about cake and def doesn't apologize for it seconds later.
I pucking loved it!
I seriously have laughed out loud so many times reading this one.
In her defense it just going to be a one time thing, the last thing she wants is the reputation of a puck bunny.
Violet is freaking hilarious her inner thoughts had me laughing out loud.
I loved how Violet was a handful and this “notorious” player barely knew how to handle her.
I loved how Violet is quirky, highly sexual and completely owns the person she is.
If you are looking for a hilarious, at times raunchy, sexy read this is for you.
3.5 Snuffie StarsOh this book...I spent half of my time belly laughing at the preposterously fun dialogue and the other half eye rolling at the quirky relationship that came about. This was definite fun....I liked it...But I also cursed at it, a lot! Meet Violet Hall and Alex Waters... So completely mismatched it was funny...at times. Violet has been around hockey and money her whole life. She is no stranger to the lifestyles of the pro athletes especially since her step-brother is a pro hockey
This was definite fun....I liked it...But I also cursed at it, a lot!
Meet Violet Hall and Alex Waters...
Violet has been around hockey and money her whole life.
Well, one night of some flirting and mouth-f***ng with hockey team captain Alex Waters and her "beaver" takes over her brain!As I already stated this is awkwardly fun.
Alex on the other hand was a sexy playboy looking God in the outside and a fuzzy beaver lovin boy in the inside.
Miscommunication, a passive-agressive man, constant wooing of cocks and boobs...and um...superhero dress up for the MonsterCock...funny yes...weird definitely.

Don’t let her scare you away – because although her mouth never stops saying crazy things the entire book, she becomes very likable.Violet has recently graduated college and works as an accountant.
The author does a really nice job of letting their courtship unfold at an easy pace.Violet may be obsessed with Monster Cock, but Alex is obsessed with her boobs.
Poor Alex.For all the sex talk, cooter talk, beaver talk and dick talk in this book – there is an actual very sweet and adorable romance that emerges.
