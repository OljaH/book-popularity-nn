Ahh so good! Rick does it again!
I enjoyed this so much! Though I will admit that I didn't enjoy it as much as book one. Percy is such a fun narrator and I'm excited to continue following his journey.
(A-) 80% | Very GoodNotes: It finds emotion and character in shame and open wounds; set beyond humanity’s shores, adrift in primeval bedlam.
I actually had the urge take this book in my hand with a strong grip and whirl it towards my head for waiting so long to read this series.
Luckily I came to my senses.For the most part things have been pretty quiet this school year and Percy even makes a new friend named Tyson, a giant of a kid.
Well, this is the Percy Jackson series and things don't stay quiet for long.
We get to see some new characters, Tyson being my favorite and new powers and awesome mythological information.
”We did all the standard numbers: ‘Down by the Aegean, I Am My Own Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandpa, This Land is Mino’s Land. The bonfire was enchanted, so the louder you sang, the higher it rose, changing colour and heat with the mood of the crowd.”Sounds like a really nice night at Camp Halfblood, right? I mean who wouldn’t want to sing “This Land is Mino’s Land”? (On a side-note: Uncle Rick if you read this, can I please have the lyrics for those songs? *lol* I’d love to read them!!!) Unfortu
*lol* I’d love to read them!!!) Unfortunately not everything is as it seems, and Percy isn’t only plagued by strange dreams of his best friend wearing a bridal gown (Hey there Grover, you’re looking good!
*lol* Otherwise he probably would have never figured out that you don’t only get messy but also get a “Golden Fleece” as well.
It did seem a little weird, but, I mean, doughnut shops weren’t really high on my list of sinister forces.”I totally agree with you Percy, but what about the dangers of the sea?
Guess they all count as sinister forces.
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! This series is SPECTACULAR so far! Loving it immensely. BOOK THREE NOW PLEASE.
No attacks or anything that can make him expelled and tomorrow he'll be going to camp Half-Blood but then Percy's mother tells him that Chiron sent her a message last night saying that it might not be safe for Percy to come to Camp half-blood and Percy also gets this nightmare that is involving Grover.
you need to read the book to know the answers ;p🌊 My Opinion 🌊 Actually, I'm supposed to post this review yesterday but I didn't because I went to the cinema yesterday with my mom and big brother and we came home very late, it's midnight.
(Notice all the vague adjectives I’m using bc I’m a loser who went ahead and read the next book before writing this review so like don’t blame me if I end up monologue about scenes from book 3)Percy and Annabeth will completely be the death of me, I mean they aren’t even a ship yet and I’ve become such dedicated trash, it’s wonderful I actually spend hours on a daily basis sighing over fanart So in this book, we continue from where book one left off.
I hate it when people do that, but the books are pretty stand-alone and we picked the wrong one when leaving the house in a hurry.Actually I can now better appreciate the cross-book story and it's quite clever, so that's good.This volume continues the mix of Greek myth, modern America, and teenagers.
Hermes pops up too.It's all rowdy and fairly random fun raiding not only Greek myth but other periods of history to give us a Civil War gunboat and some famous pirates to boot.The twist is actually a clever one, neatly mirroring the villian's supposed victory with the heroes'.Solid YA entertainment.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...
What an amazing adventure it was!!
I loved it!
Percy's narration was still amazing!
Now Camp Half-Blood's magical boundary has been weakened as someone has poisoned the Pine Tree which strengthen it.
There is only cure to reverse the effect of poison.
For this cure, Percy has to go on a quest to find it.
A fatal quest!I loved everything in this book!!
Action scenes were amazing.Chariot Races were also amazing.Every single character in this book is enjoyable and interesting.
Especially Tyson is an amazing addition.
I really wish to see him in the next book.Ending was shocking.
Titan Lord, again, fooled Percy.Overall, I LOVED THIS BOOK!!July 20, 2017
Loving this series.Between working my way through this series, the Harry Potter series, and Miss Peregrine’s series this year, I am enjoying myself immensely. I am apparently newly obsessed with middle grade fantasy and comic books. Who would have thunk it. And to know Riordan has three other series in addition to this one just makes me childishly joyful.
What is it with me and not knowing how I feel about rating a book lately! I would like to give all the stars to Tyson! I am in love with Tyson and what he is =) I'm really hoping to get more of him in the other books. I thought the rest of the book was good and I love reading about all of the creatures. Of course, Percy and them are usually getting in trouble with all of said creatures. Well, not the sweet ones. I look forward to finishing the box set =)
I need to take Tyson, wrap a blanket around him, give him a stuffed Rainbow and protect him from everything.
I think the humor is definitely my favorite thing about these books. I wish I had read them a few years ago but I'm still really enjoying them as an adult too. I can't wait to read the next one! Also, can we just talk about those Goodreads emails "You've finished the book!" I know, Goodreads. I just told you that myself.
“Don't you ever feel that way? Like you could do a better job if you ran the world?''Um... no. Me running the world would be kind of a nightmare.”  this and the final book were tied as my favourite I enjoyed Sea of Monsters SO much. After reading The Lightning Thief, I wasn't sure if I would ever continue this series. It didn't grab me as I would have wanted and I didn't feel very connected to the characters. But Sea of Monsters FINALLY got me on board. Something about it was just so, so much m
this and the final book were tied as my favourite I enjoyed Sea of Monsters SO much.
my favourite part of this book, and this series overall, is the charactersI love everyone so much.
I think this book was so much stronger than the first because it really solidified the relationships between the characters Annabeth and Percy have so much time together and their relationship gets a lot of development which I loved.
I love the set up for the long series wide arc and tropes like the chosen one are my FAVOURITE.

Percy Jackson Series Review:The Lightning Thief ★★★★★The Sea of Monsters: See below!The Titan's Curse: RTCThe Battle of the Labyrinth: RTCThe Last Olympian: RTCI always get a bit nervous going into the second book in a series.
There's a lot of pressure on the author to prove that the first wasn't just a fluke, and that they can keep the story compelling over the course of a number of middle-books in the series before reaching the grand finale.
I had faith in Rick Riordan though - considering the legacy of popular series he's written - and I'm happy to say that he didn't let me down.Percy remains one of my new favorite narrative voices I've encountered over the course of this year.
Look mom! It’s a book! It’s a movie! No, it’s a book that is better than the movie!!!Now, I know that is the case in 90% of the cases, but here it is so painfully obvious. The movies butchered Kronos’ arc and that is one of the best arcs in any book I’ve ever read.Seriously, Kronos and that main minion of him (I won’t name him because I don’t want to spoil things) are such amazing villains.And then you have Riordan’s jokes. Bring ‘em on Rick!!
Fetus May was wrong this deserves 5 stars and more I love my children s o mu ch o h myg od I was literally tearing up at the end over the characters is this allowed
My two kids would argue to the death with me about them, and I don't know why I don't like them, I just...don't.
(Too much adventure is bad for the heart.) Maybe I can't buy into so many perfectly-timed rescues-from-nowhere when Percy is just about to bite the big one, or the way Percy goes into every new situation thinking, "maybe I shouldn't do this," but does it anyway and it's ALWAYS a trap by some monster.
And because not every book is every person's cup o' tea, I'll keep recommending this series to kids, because they think it's awesome.
I LOVE THE TRIO SO MUCH 😍I LOVE THE ADVENTURES 😍I LOVE OUR LITTLE CYCLOP, TYSON 😍THE BANTERS MADE ME L-O-L 😍THAT ENDING 😍need i scream more???
“Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that we're related for better or for worse...and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.” This might be my least favorite book of the series. Reading this book in one night, I kind of felt like I was being left out by some of the characters that I was attached to from The Lightning Thief. Percy Jackson still slays as always. His attitude, wit, and sense of humor fascinated
Reading this book in one night, I kind of felt like I was being left out by some of the characters that I was attached to from The Lightning Thief.
That being said, I liked the adventure where Percy and his fellows sail to the sea this time.
She acts like a child, especially towards Percy.
I appreciate the feelings I got from this series, it's like being a child and hold a HP book in my hands again.
Gods and Demigods are becoming the whole clear picture, and I'd like to see them working together in the last book.
Such a fun read! I absolutely love this series and can’t wait to get to the next part!instagram || my blog || twitter
SO GOOD SO FUCKING GOOD. I NEED THE 3RD BOOK NOW.
TITLE: The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians #2)AUTHOR: Rick RiordanPUBLISHER: Disney Hyperion BooksPUBLICATION DATE: 2014GENRE: Middle Grade, Mythology, AdventureThis series just keeps getting better and better!
After escaping the huge giant bullies at the school, Annabeth, Percy, and Tyson rode the cab of doom to get to Camp Half-Blood.
He was just a teenage demigod who feels, speaks, and listens like all normal teenager would which I think is one of the reasons why a lot of people read this.
Aside from Percy, I love Annabeth.
Have you guys read the Percy Jackson series?

I never read any of his books, never saw the Percy film(s), nothing – my first introduction to the world was last summer, when I picked up The Lightning Thief, and I thought it was cute enough, but I wasn’t super impressed, beyond totally loving the representation for dyslexia (which I’ve never seen in any other book) and ADHD (which I have, and never see rep for).
Tyson is such a precious and sweet character, though, with a lot of his own skills and capabilities to bring to the table, and I loved watching Percy grow close to him and learn to love him despite the reputation that Cyclopes have.All in all, this book was a total delight to read, and I can’t wait to continue the series!
PC Jackson, the politically-correct superhero, teams up with a girl and a black dude to fight a bunch of monsters.Remember, it's still okay to hate monsters. Enjoy it while you can.[Is this correct? Ed]
It's like every movie's adapted from a book.
Today I saw the movie Jupiter Ascending  and I just thought, "This has got to be a book".
Next thing I know, I'm asking google for "Jupiter Ascending the book".
I mean really, everything would be perfectly calm and cool, and my eyes would stray away from the pages of the book for one minute and next thing you know he's getting clubbed or pummeled or enchanted by some hideous creature.
But I'm all for adventure, and in my book there can never be such a thing as enough or too much of 
Edit : My pupils will have to wait, because this one is not grabbing me at all :/ Honestly, I didn't intend to read this book so soon but my pupils were so passionate about The Lightning Thief that they begged me to study this one. Now, you should know that I have two rules : - I never pass up an opportunity for my pupils to read.- I never buy something for my class that I didn't read before.So... Here we go, Percy.
The magical boundary that protects Camp Half-Blood is weakening, and deadly monsters attempt to wound the demigod boarder patrols as much as they can.There is only one thing that can cure Thailia's Tree:the wonderfull healing Golden Fleece.Percy and his friend Annabeth desparatly need to go on this quest: the Fleece is located in the Sea of Monsters, also known as the Bermuda Triangle; only a child of Posiden could possibly suceed.
The almost-blind Cyclops thinks Grover is a girl and is going to marry him!Now Percy, his half-brother Tyson, and Annabeth must sneak away from camp to rescue Grover from a dreadful marriage, and insure the Clarssie doesn't get eaten by man-eating sheep.I really liked this book because it was the most creative of all the series.
