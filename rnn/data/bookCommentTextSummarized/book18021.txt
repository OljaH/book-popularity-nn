Those extra points of view just seemed lazy to me, just a way for the author to do some "telling" and less "showing" about the characters.
To make matters worse, the author switched from 1st to 3rd person throughout the book!
It was truly bizarre.4) Diana's familiar: I won't say too much about this topic so I don't give away any spoilers, but I was utterly confused about the change in the firedrake's personality throughout the story, especially towards the end.
It was like the author had a brilliant idea for the first book and then had no idea how to carry it through.
I'm disappointed that so many people are refusing to read this book because it's taken so long to come out. Shit happens that pushes publication dates back. Lots of shit happens. And some of you guys are acting like it's a personal affront and the author is just trying to piss you off. You're acting like children. No wonder authors hate reviewers. The book hasn't even come out yet and you're already talking trash.
This last book in the trilogy is pretty much the same as the first two: excessive details, wandering plot lines, horrible pacing, paper-thin characters, and fang-less boring vampires.
Matthew the vampire and Diana the witch return to Sept-Tours, the de Clermont ancestral home.
Diana and her helpers (it takes three witches, two vampires and one firedrake to steal this damn manuscript) go to the Bodleian Library.
Finally, they decide the library is not going to send them the manuscript so Diana says, oh yeah, I’m a witch.
As a reader, it is hard to wait but novelists should be regarded for what they do so well.
Let's not treat our dear author as a blogger or fan fictionist.2) Waiting is part of being a reader.
Let's not even get into The Game of Thrones.3) Another beautiful part of being a reader is reading other books and falling in love with other characters.
So many things make up for this and as I already mentioned, I feel satisfied and I can't wait to read this series again and again.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I got into it, but I felt bothered by her lackadaisical approach to resolving the basic plot points of the world she created.
Gallowglass Love Triangle-I thought for sure she was going to set him up with the vampire witch lady-but really, after watching her his entire life, he's going to leave her alone without Matthew?
5. Uh, in the novel, the book was meant to be evil and now it's not?
7. What happens to the book of life when Diana dies?8.
If so, what was the point of going to Yale?11.
Didn't Diana already say she wasn't going back to her academe life?

Matthew's and Diana's love for each other warmed my heart and brought a smile to my face through out the whole book.
I'm definitely going to miss them (and all supporting characters) something fierce now when trilogy is over!The Book of Life is a story about finding peace and absolution, about accepting who you are.
I'm truly shocked that this book recieved such great reviews. Ms. Harkness still spins a great tale, but I thought the whole of this novel was poorly constructed and lacking substance. The conclusions were tenuous stretches at best and she had a lot of trouble tying everything up at the end given the complexities she'd introduced. As a result of her difficulties (and profitability), it's quite clear from this book that there will be additional novels to join what was to be a 3-book series. This book was extremely disappointing.
Update June 2017:  Upon further ruminations on where the story could have gone, I assembled an alternative ending. (Not a story -- just a synopsis of what would have made me feel better.) Go to the spoiler at the end of the review to read.What just happened?I was so disappointed. I adored A Discovery of Witches and Shadow of Night, but I feel like this book did not tie up any loose ends, answer any questions, or really provide any satisfaction for the build-up of the previous two novels.A few o
What happened in my alternative world that makes me feel better about the amount of time and obsession I poured into the earlier books: (view spoiler)[In the past, difficult life conditions meant that there were more creatures than humans.
The knowledge of the creation of the covenant is lost to time and secrecy; creatures only know they must try and avoid one another.In modern day, Dr. Bishop discovers the book, now known as the Ashmole manuscript.
With her skills in historical research (not to mention, time travel) and Matthew’s skills in biology and DNA analysis, Diana and Matthew set out to discover the names of the victims of Ashmole 72.
It is really quite nice to have new fiction that can turn alchemy into alchemy.Secondly, I enjoy themes that speak to the heart of the world and why we're living in it without becoming some broken down biological soup or a bunch of creatures standing around holding hands and singing "we are the world".
Sure, a little bit of both happens in the novel, but I noticed something.
It was the deeper themes that really sparked my imagination.That and the novel also happened to be a fun urban fantasy romp.
This series went from mediocre to bad to terrible over a course of three books.The main problem is the author clearly didn’t think anything through. She can write well; her prose is quite flashy in places and  some  of her characters are quite intriguing. The first book was a great idea and it really set the tone and got the plot moving, the problem was from there the author clearly had no idea what to do. In Shadow of Night Diana found herself transported back in time to the Elizabethan era. (Y

(You what?) And if that wasn’t bad enough, we never really get the answers we were promised as this book ends.
Not a good way to write a book.
He is the most useless, hapless, pointless, ineffectual and weak blood-sucker that has ever existed in fiction.
You can win The Book of Life's paperback, All Souls trilogy swags and Diana's commonplace book in Young Adult Hollywood.In this final conclusion of All Souls trilogy, Diana and Matthew returns to the present time.
(hide spoiler)] We also get to meet some of the old characters who are returning in the present times like Gallowglass, and the other members of the De Clermont family.
I couldn’t help but crave more back story and while there are some twists that, I didn’t anticipate coming, The Book of Life ended neatly.
This book was flat out boring and a disappointing end to the series.
I realized that the series lost it's charm when I was mid way through the book and basically nothing had happened to further the overall story from the previous two books.
The menagerie of forgettable characters gets in the way of the overall story.
Listen, I enjoyed the first book because it was a fun filled story with some new spins on supernatural creatures, the second book was enjoyable as well because we got some character progression.
This book basically went no where until the last 15% of the story where everything gets nearly tied up and happy endings for all.

Real-time reading posts will continue throughout the holiday weekend, so if you are stuck in an airport you can always check in here and see what's happening in the 16th century (when there was no such thing as an airport delay...)************Update 11/6/2013 "The Book of Life"***************The All Souls Trilogy began with A Discovery of Witches (2011).
Here’s the description as it appears in catalogue copy:“After traveling through time in SHADOW OF NIGHT, the second book in Deborah Harkness’s enchant­ing series, historian and witch Diana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies.
I had a moment's panic when I started this book because there were so many characters everywhere and I didn't remember any of them!
Matthew and Diana however seem to have had character transplants.
In fact this book is a bit of a mess.
Not a lot really happens and what does goes nowhere in explaining things like The Book Of Life.
And the description of Diana's appearance (trying for no spoilers here) is kind of weird.
In fact it is really weird.This probably sounds as though I did not like the book.
This marks the conclusion of the All Souls trilogy and I couldn't be happier. From the first book on, this had become my new favourite story about witches and other supernatural creatures.In this third volume, Diana and Matthew are home from their timewalk in the past. They had to leave loved ones behind, which is never easy, and had to discover that disaster had struck in their original timeline as well. Not to mention that Diana is pregnant (with twins no less!) and the enemies are closing i
However, it was also the life and uniqueness she gave every single character that drew me in - not only the secondary characters were fantastic, but the tertiary ones as well!Ysabeau will probably always be my favourite but I've come to appreciate the entire ensemble (except for Baldwin, no matter how much he developed throughout this third book).Add to that some pretty exciting locations, this time in the present, as well as the on-going but never boring mystery of Ashmole 782 that combines history/mystery with solid pieces of science, and the mad dash to keep everyone save from mad vampires and closed-minded witches.Speaking of closed-mindedness: the author touched on some really big topics, too.
Ok. Here's my issue: the first book in this trilogy was SO GREAT, in no small part because I felt like I KNEW Matthew and Diana.
In Shadow of Night, and even more so in The Book of Life, the characters exist solely as pawns to move the plot points along.
It wasn't until the end of this book that I really felt like we got back to Diana's voice, that this was her story.
I knew more about how Diana felt about the different flavors of tea in her kitchen than how pregnancy impacted her.
Honestly, at this point, these books don't even feel part of the same series

WOW... The wait was worth it!!!!This was a captivating book...I think... The end is only the beginning because... ************************************************I need this book Like today!!!!...omg omg faints!
Also known as "Ashmole 782" (which sounds like a nightclub in Amsterdam, jussayin'), the Book of Life is much sought after by witches who believe it to be the first spell book.With Matthew's blood rage and Diana's discovery of her being a special type of witch called a "weaver", they are able to (view spoiler)[procreate and have twins that are both part vampire and part witch  (hide spoiler)].Diana must also stand up to a council of other Bright Born and inform them of the poor decisions they've made throughout history, due to their collective and willful ignorance.One thing I could say I didn't like about this series is that there are just way too many characters to keep track of.
It had some flaws but all in all it was a well built world, an addition to the fictional realm of witch folklore for adults.Book II Shadow of Night was historical fiction, a name dropping time travel trip filled to the brim with characters from the Crusader states, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the House of Austria, along with a British monarch and her noblemen.
I found the descriptive rape and torture of witches and vampires and the killing of children too graphic for my taste.The exclusion of persons of color in the first two novels is remedied by the author with the revelation that Diana's best friend Chris introduced in Book I is a "black man from Alabama." This is a fact I seemed to have missed in the first book.
The third book of the trilogy, with a lot of threads to weave together, creatures to sort out, and battles to fight.
Deborah Harkness does it all, and then some, with gasp-worthy moments on and off the battlefields that her vampires, witches, and daemons have to populate, and moments of sheer beauty.
I am, simultaneously, well-satisfied, and sorry that the trilogy isn't (at least) a quartet.
Wonderful, wondrous, magical, and excellent.I received an ARC from NetGalley.
This is an honest review.Note, 2018 - not only did I not enjoy this book as much the 2nd time around -- I did not remember most of it.

October 2017: Yep, this is still just as fantastic as the first time I read it. I loved the story and the ending and the everything. Now I’m ready for more books with Gallowglass, Miriam, and I could easily do with a million pages of Ysabeau. I’m going to have to reread these more often.  Original review This was absolute perfection. I felt there was a lot of loose ends that needed to be taken care of, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It definitely didn't disappoint. I don't want to say too much

Diana grows a lot in this installment.
The Book of Life is another fantastic example of the way a trilogy should end.**Huge thanks to Viking Adult and NetGalley for providing the arc in exchange for an honest review**
I liked it (overall...I am pretty sure), but I am going to apologize in advance because this review will most likely end up being a disorganized collection of my thoughts on this book and series, but after finishing it, I don't think I can write it any other way.First off, I would definitely recommend reading a wiki page about Book 2 in the trilogy before starting the third book.
The wiki definitely helped me remember a lot of the second book and it came back to me slowly as I read the third, but there were still times throughout the book that I could not remember events or characters for the first two (no joke, I still have no idea who one of the godparents is???).
GR asks me, Wht did I think? Well...1st read 2 stars2nd read 2.65 starsThird time lucky? Notching up to 3.85 StarsThis time I was better prepared for the useless and disappointing parts. And BR-ing it, helped me better to vent out anger and frustrations.P.S: I desperately pray for a book for Gallowglass. I sincerely hope she does write one else, I'l probably act like a crazy fan and send her emails to give us a story for that poor, awfully amazing charater.
What the hell happened?By the end of this book, the only thing you'll realise is that the whole story was completely pointless.
All that fannying about from one country to the next and one time to the next was really just a cover for the fact that: a) it is Romeo and Juliet with a happier ending (unsuitable love match due to family conflict) b) it is Twilight (poor vampire husband can't control himself round the mrs) c) it is every 'i'm-a-nobody-but-all-of-a-sudden-i'm-the-chosen-one' story you've ever readThere was no real closure, no point.
In the end, what did the Ashmole manuscript actually do?
I reread books 1 & 2 this spring as I impatiently waited for Delivery Day. So I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I finally got the chance to read The Book of Life.Perhaps the kindest way of explaining my response is that I COULD put this book down.
Ground was tread and then needlessly retread, but the must frustrating problem with the book was the introduction of seemingly important plot points that then went nowhere.I've seen the other reviews on Amazon.
The writing was only so-so, but the plot and strong characters were able to carry it for Ms Harkness.
Please update the Deborah Harkness website with some new info about the All Souls Trilogy! Ready to read Book 3!
He also, despite them both being many years into adulthood and despite Matthew having no issue sexing humans without hurting them, refuses to have sex with Diana until the second book, because this is a really common thing for adult male love interests to do.
Now, my memory isn’t the most reliable, but I remember Diana being fairly strong, but she spends most of this book crying, talking about the babies in her belly (I hate this word), being bossed around by Matthew, and getting new powers basically thrown at her.Ostensibly, The Book of Life has a big bad to be taken down in the form of Benjamin, one of Matthew’s vampire sons.
I am not sure why I feel the need to discuss this book, since there are so many frustrating books out there, but here goes...
It seemed like Harkness was making things up as she went along, as though she hadn't realized in the first two books that she'd need to set things up, so she just popped them in as she went along in book 3.
It seems like the book was written so quickly that revisions weren't made that should have been made to address such questions.
It was odd for it to be there when the author didn't deal with obvious questions.The first two books had a depth of tone that was intriguing.
