Found a copy of the 14th impression of this in my great aunt's bookshelf (dated 1943). An amusing little fortune telling book, certainly intended for the maids (90% of the queries relate to marriage...) Raised a sad smile when I saw the questions she'd ticked off, only to end her days as a spinster.
