I think that the most oustanding aspect about this book is the Harpies. I think they stole the show and they were just my favorites.Probably won't review this one since it was just okay for me and I really want to dive into the next books I truly want to re-read.
Her gaze skittered away from him. “It was okay, I guess.”He popped his jaw. It was okay. She guessed. She f*cking guessed. By gods, he’d give her another demonstration.

This is my favorite LOTU so far :) Great book with the first half of it being absolutely amazing <3The Lords have gone to Egypt searching for the third artifact that will help them find Pandora' Box, but instead of the artifact they find a Hunter facility full of pregnant woman, who are all immortal in some way.One of the women isn't pregnant, but is feared by all, even Hunters.She is Gwendolyn, and has been imprisoned for a year inside the pyramid.For some reason Sabin is the only one that she trusts, and when he frees her, he takes her into his care.After finding out the huge power Gwen possesses, Sabin plans to bring her into their was as a weapon, but one he first must train to prevent a bloodbath.After he starts having feelings for her, he will have to make a choice between love or war.Gwendolyn the Timid is a harpy with great power, but one she doesn't know how to control.
Fighting and killing is his only pleasure.Gwen Skyhawk or Gwendolyn the Timid:Harpy Supernatural ability: She is an immortal (although for the time being is only 27 years old) and very strong (although she does not particularly crave violence).
He whispers words of insecurities and creates strong emotions of self-doubt.
Most of his enemies commit suicide when they listen at the whispers for a long time.Moreover his last lover, Darla, had killed herself because of the voices and he’d vowed not to get involved again.
Gwen was imprisoned by Hunters for a year, until Sabin and the Lords saved her.
^^THIS WHISPER IS CUMMING OFF LOUD AND CLEAR!^^4.5I like to talk about all the ways I love this book, I was really disappointed with book 3 in the series even though I loved it.
One problemo is his demon is a bitch, Doubt needed to be cut down in size and Gwen is right woman to do it, does not come easy though.This book was one twist after another, and I was riveted.
Sabin all the ways I wanted him naked, and never doubting who is boss.
3.5 stars out of 5The Darkest Whisper is the fourth book of the Lords of the Underworld series, the story of Sabin, Keeper of Doubt, and Gwen Skyhawk, a powerful harpy.So powerful she is that Sabin’s demon goes into hiding every time she is around. So not taming the beast here, but intimidating it. SabinI like Sabin, though he is often single-minded and stubborn. All he cares about is the war, and defeating their enemy. And for that he is not willing to take any risk. “Everyone had a deep, dark

GwenI adore the character of Gwen, with all of her abilities, special harpy characteristics, and strength.
The romanceI liked the connection between Sabin and Gwen.
What I disliked is the way Sabin proved his love for her, how he wins her trust.
"The only question was, would he put Gwen before his war?"Why should he?????
It's the story of Sabin and Gwen.
When Sabin sets her free she instantly kills one of the hunters.
It takes everything in Sabin to calm Gwen down.
Her harpy inside her would start to show her anger if anyone even thought about touching Sabin.
Oh yes...Sabin defiantly soothed Gwen's harpy down.
Sabin was also possessive of Gwen.
Sabin was also possessive of Gwen.
I loved how Sabin's demon Doubt was scared shitless of Gwen when she was angry.
lol Sabin wasn't scared of Gwen and he wasn't about to let her be timid.
Does Sabin train Gwen to control her anger?
I liked that he loved all of her, harpy part included, and strived to see that she was a capable warrior.
I haven't read too many books that had harpies as main characters.
I loved the romance between Gwen and Sabin.
By the time the love scenes came around, I was like, "Heck Yeah!" Gwen and Sabin turned out to be my second favorite couple after Anya and Lucien.Being able to catch up with the Lords and Co. and their women since the last book was another part of this book I enjoyed.
Λυπάμαι που το λεω, αλλά δεν μου άρεσαν ο Σαβιν και η Γκουεν σαν ζευγάρι. Είχαν το λιγότερο ενδιαφέρον σε σχέση με όσους έχω διαβάσει μέχρι τώρα (και βρίσκομαι στο 6ο)Κάτι δεν μου έκατσε καλά. Ευτυχώς οι εξελίξεις και η δράση του βιβλίου κράτησαν το ενδιαφέρον μου και τη βαθμολογία σε ικανοποιητικά επίπεδα
5 stars – Paranormal RomanceIt’s been a while since I’ve immersed into the adventures of those sexy, angst-laden bad boy demon Lords, and I’d almost forgotten how much I love losing myself in their world.I wasn’t too sure how I’d feel about The Darkest Whisper because Sabin (the keeper of the demon of Doubt) has never been one of my favorite Lords, but I was pleasantly surprised.
I loved that this story featured all the beloved LOTU characters, including quite a bit from Lucien and Anya (she still cracks me up!), Aeron and his little demon girl pet/companion Legion, Gideon, and my boy Paris (the tortured warrior needs a HEA...fast!).
Harpy'leri severim ama gwen tiplemelerindeki sevmiyorum.gwen ne yaa adında kılık yok bi kere.
yani lordlara yapılır mı bu gena hala soruyorum dicem yapmışsın zaten.hikaye güzel, hele zaten kuşku gibi bir iblisin varsa daha da güzelleşiyor.
ama sonra bir harpy geliyor ve...
şey gibi düşün...
denize bakan sakin bi starbucktasın klima tependen esiyor elinde venti boy extra şurup caramel cream var.
sonra etrafı birden ergenler basıyor ellerinde tall boy hot chocolatte ve gülmüyor anırıyorlar.
işte kitabın gelişim şeması böyle bir şey.peki bu benim sevmeme engel mi?
bu kitap, sabin ponçiğim  oğlan tarafı olup bayıldığım ama kız tarafınını ta 7 göbek sülalesinden nefret ettiğim ilk kitap değil.
asdfasdfgwen ne yaa...xoxoiko
I read this book a few months ago, but just realized I hadn't caught up on my ratings and reviews...anyway, I loved this book!!!
Reyes is still my favorite hero, but I really loved how this book started out and came together.
Gwen is a fabulous heroine, and I loved watching her grow stronger with every page.
Gena gives me a freaking inferiority complex every time I read one of the Lords of the Underworld books!
If you haven't read this series, I highly recommend you start at the beginning, with The Darkest Night.
The books just keep getting better and better!
(And did I mention Reyes?
Ε Τζίνα μου καλή σε αυτό μου τα χάλασες πολύ να ξες....Τι ωραία που ξεκινήσαμε με το να μας γνωρίσεις το άλλο μισό της Αμφιβολίας και με όλες αυτές τις νέες πληροφορίες για τις Άρπυιες και όχι μόνο.
Γτ???Δεν προχωρούσε ωραία και καλά η ιστορία με τους κυνηγούς μέχρι τώρα?
από τις 380 σελίδες οι μισές ήταν για να μας πει το τι έχει γίνει με τους δεσμευμένους άρχοντες, τι γίνεται με τους ελεύθερους και φυσικά όλο αυτό το μπέρδεμα με τους κυνηγούς και όχι μόνο...
Και για το επίμαχο ζευγάρι το πολύ πολύ να χάλασε ούτε 100 σελίδες...Κρίμας και τον συμπαθούσα τον Σαβίν...3 αστέρια χωρίς αμφιβολία ...
Bu seriye objektif yaklaşamıyorum😍😍 Her ne kadar kitap boyunca hazırlıkları yapılan savaşların bir anda haldur huldur geçilmesi canımı sıksa da kurgulanan dünya ve karakterler o kadar içime işliyor ki kıyamıyorum başka puan vermeye ne yapayım😇😇İtiraf ediyorum Sabin'in kitabı olduğunu duyduğumda üzülmüştüm. Çünkü daha çok merak ettiğim Lordlar var. Üstelik İko'nun da ''Gwen'den nefret ediceksin .s.s'' diye söylenmesi ile çok korkmuştum. İyi ki İko ile zevklerimiz uyuşmuyor çünkü Gwen is the best bitches!!! Nasıl sevilmez ki? Böyle güçlü heroine kolay bulunmuyor.
I don't know what I expected from Sabin but he is way cooler than I expected, he is also so modern, 
What I love about Sabin, Keeper of Doubt is the fact that he’s so hellbent on ending this war with Galen.
I think it’s kind of ironic that his demon is Doubt because Sabin seems pretty sure of himself.
Through his never-ending love and support and his ruthless training, Gwen is becoming more and more capable.
Yeah, steamy.The only thing that kind of got me upset was the fact that Gwen just let Galen go in the end.
Yes, I know that if they captured him the series would end and there would be no books left to read, but still.
Another five stars all round so many more people or immortals are coming to the party in this book there getting more and more interesting as I go along :)
Basically, demon-harbouring hot guy sees the pretty girl of his dreams, he's struck dumb on sight and then spends most of the book trying to convince himself that either: a) She could never possibly like him, b) Even if she does like him, he's no good for her what with his all his big badness going on, or c) Both.I admit that even though the series is a guilty pleasure, the stories are getting somewhat tiresome.
It was hot, don't get me wrong, but it was basically the same shower scene that we were treated to in book number one with Maddox and Ashlyn getting down and dirty in the bathroom.
I really loved the progression of Sabin and Gwen. I loved watching her combat her Harpy and finally seeing her parentage--didn't see that one coming. I'm enjoying every word of these books and savoring them.
Sabin/Demon of Doubt came into the series after the other group of Lords rejoined their comrades--a book or so ago.
She was embarrassed to tell her sisters...they were very old and lethal.If anyone has read "A Hunger Like No Other" by Kresley Cole, I thought the heroine in that book was a lot like Gwen; unless her Harpie was released, then all hell would break loose.The author spent a lot of time during the last half of the book building up secondary characters.
Şu seriden her ay bir kitap çıksa arka arkaya yaa!!
Nasıl güzeldi yine..Anarşi Tanrıçası Anya bile Gwen'in yanında pamuk şekeri gibi kaldı resmen :DBir kere de olsa bir kadının, sahiplenerek "O benim...
Benimsin," deyişini, Sabin gibi bir adama emirler verişini okumak ve adamın şaşkınlığına şahit olmak harikaydı :DBu arada fan gözüyle Sabin ve Gwen oluyor kendileri :DParis'in durumu fena..
Bakalım bir sonraki kitaplarda ne gibi etkileri olacak..Gideon'un yalanlarını okumak her zaman için çok zevkli (view spoiler)[ama bu kez ağzından bazı doğruların çıkışına şahit olmak da feci keyifliydi..
(hide spoiler)] Ama canıma yaptılar yine yapacaklarını..
Onun için de işler bir hayli ilginç..
4,3
kitabı En Karanlık Fısıltı bitti.İlk 3 kitaba göre daha durağandı.
:D <3Sabin, Şüphenin Muhafızı epey karşı konulmaz bir karakter.
<3 Ortaya yine harika bir kurgu çıkmış.Ancak bu seride anlatılan kesinlikle salt aşk değil.
Pandora'nın kutusunu bulmak için atlatılan maceralar bir efsane.
kitabı Paris'in hikâyesi.
kitabı Gazap'ın muhafızı Aeron'un kitabına kaçıyorum.Okuyun bu seriyi.
Sonunda lanet olası bir hamle yapacak mıydı?Gwen'i sabunlayıp durulamayı tamamlayınca durdu.
Nefesi gırtlağına takılıp kalmıştı, Gwen sanki içinin gittikçe yoğunlaşan bir sıcaklıkla dolduğunu hissetti.
Gözleri parlak, ateş gibi sıcaktı, sıktığı dudaklarının etrafında sıkıntısını ele veren çizgiler oluşmuştu."Tenin..." diye tekrarladı.Gwen'in, tenini kaplayan kurum olmadan parladığını bilmek için aynaya ihtiyacı yoktu.
I think that in few pages she made Gwen totally disappear.* The Harpies as a species.
His story is one I want to hear.What I didn't like:* I couldn't feel the chemistry between Gwen and Sabin, it seemed all very superficial and even repetitive.
At one point of the story Sabin's demon, Doubt, was dismissed because it was afraid of Harpies.
Well, I liked the side stories more than the main couple and disliked the end, but the writing is still light and funny, the world building remains interesting, so I'll read the next book.
In fact, I didn't just like Sabin's story, I loved it.Sabin, like all the Lords, shares his body with a demon.
The Lords stumble across them one day while fighting Hunters and rescue the women.
Gwen and Sabin have an instant connection.One of the things I love about this series, besides the uber-hot-sex, is that no two heroes or heroines are alike.
I loved watching her grow into her Harpy-abilities as she falls harder and harder for Sabin.
And it develops as the ongoing story arc of the Lords' battle with Galen and the Hunters continue.
Not to mention the most intense sex scene of the series was in this book if you ask me -You know which one I'm talking about, it involves a forest and a pissed off Harpy in training who's nudged by a certain demon of Doubt, and I think somewhere in there there was also tearing of pants and pushing a Lord up against a tree.
The book matched Sabin, the most aggressive of the Lords in my opinion, and the a true leader, with Gwen, a fierce Harpy who's yet to discover and learn not to fear her powers.
THE DARKEST WHISPER is Sabin's story and he's the keeper of the demon doubt.
This gorgeous immortal warrior spends his time on the battlefield because his demon forces him to involuntarily destroy friends and particularly lovers self confidence (with the darkest whisper).
Luckily her harpy side is strong, able to tune-out Sabin's demon and lust after the warrior.
Throughout Sabin and Gwen's story we are given generous amounts of POV's and sub-plots from the other immortal warriors and their mates.
The Darkest Whisper is full of twists and turns, great action scenes, romance and we even learn a few secrets.
I think along with Lucien and Anya's book.
They are in Egypt looking for the other artifacts where they stumble across Hunters who are raping immortal women to support their supposed cause.
Gwen has been trapped in the pyramid for a year now and has had to watch the cruelness of the Hunters, she is immortal but what exactly she is, is not clear to the Lords.
Sabin and Gwen have instant chemistry but Doubt is very strong so Sabin is careful.
(hide spoiler)]The banter between William and Anya is great here is one of favorites from the book.
While there was a lot of romance between the two of them, I also feel like their love story was not the main focus of the book.
While I liked Sabin and Gwen, I liked the book as a whole better.
Since Gwen can kick so much butt by herself, if all the Harpies were together it seems like they would win the war all by themselves.
There was a lot of set up for future Lords of the Underworld books and after all the sequel baiting the one I'm looking forward to the most is Kane, Keeper of Disaster.
Sabin, keeper of Doubt, merciless warrior, driven leader and all-round badass.
Sabin avoids women because his demon, Doubt, damages his lovers even to the point of suicide.Plot-wise [meaning the overall plot of the series:] we don't seem to advance much; but I suspect considerable grounds were laid for future books.
Comic interest is provided by Gwen's sisters who can almost approve of her choice - after all he's a bloodthirsty warrior with the social skills of a piranha.
The Darkest Fire (2008)[related ebook:]2.
The Darkest Kiss (2008)4.
The Darkest Whisper (2009)I think I feel a series re-read coming on...
This is my favourite book of the series so far! I loved both Sabin and Gwen, as well as the glimpses in to the other Lords lives. Especially Aeron I can't wait for his book, and I think Legion is so cute! I think I may be in the minority in this regard though. Oh and NIX! Nix from IAD was in it briefly! I would love to have a cross over between the two series, but apparently that isn't gonna happen
