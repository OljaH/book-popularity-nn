This series would make a wonderful graphic novel‚Äîit has lots of prehistoric beasties, action-packed battle scenes, dramatic psychic powers, and lots of opinionated & quirky characters.
Humans from our future have become part of the Galactic Milieu, a kind of Federation of those races with psychic powers of various sorts.
And the Milieu has made a ruling that no one with advanced psychic powers is able to take advantage of the time gate.
What could possibly go wrong?Upon arriving in the Pliocene, these non-psychic humans find themselves taken into custody by an alien race, the Tanu, who also fled their own world in order to do things their own way.
The scope of this saga spanning eight novels is staggering.
Epic conflict rages between ancient races, and the future destiny of man is decided.
The initial four books make up The Saga of Pliocene Exile.
* The Many-Coloured Land * The Golden Torc * The Nonborn King * The AdversaryThese can be read as a standalone series, but who would want to stop there?The ‚Äúbridge‚Äù book deals with first contact and the emergence of humans with ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù powers such as telekinesis.
The settings, especially in Exiles are fabulous.Unfortunately, the US covers are beyond awful, but don‚Äôt be put off by that.
I couldn‚Äôt tell you anything important about almost any of them, other than ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs a Tanu knight/firvulag warrior/lowlife.‚ÄùAnd those descriptions cover pretty much everyone in this book.In addition to this problem where things that aren‚Äôt important got a lot of air time while things that were important got swept under the rug, was a sudden change in writing quality.This is a stupid example, and yet I think it proves my point perfectly:Mercy is running through a castle with an ally, and a dog jumps out and startles them.
Unfortunately although there are two lesbians in the book they fit the two stereotypes with Amerie being the functionally asexual one and Felice being the psychotic product of abuse as a child one.After all those pages I hung on in case the ending gives it all some meaning or a ray of sunshine in a world where the men are hypermasculine and noone actually seems to give a shit about other people at all.
This series is amazing. The writer's canvas is huge - there are so many plots and so many characters, but I was never confused about who was doing what. Their plotting and machinations are as intricate as those at any royal court, and the double-crosses abound.
this one was harder to get through. The first two I read cover to cover in a two or three days.
A GREAT READ!!!!!!!!!
3.5 stars
There is really no letup in this series, the world is well established, the pieces are in place and this third book brings not one, but two big showdowns. Satisfying every time.
*initial thoughts*Since I listened to the first two in audiobook format, it's really hard to tell if this didn't work so well for me because it wasn't being "performed" at me or for other reasons. I found myself skimming a lot wanting the plot to just move along. The book consists of multiple simultaneous plots that ultimately come together and of four of them I wasn't into two, which didn't help. That said I still liked the idea of the land and the world I just wasn't a fan of the execution this time around.
The three communities, Tanu, human and Firvulag, are all seeking to rebuild in various ways, the different factions among them trying to use the chaos - coming more from the deaths of a large proportion of the Tanu ruling class than from the other damage done - to seize power and influence events.The major factions are the main body of the Tanu, led by the extraordinary human Aiken Drum (a test-tube baby, the non-born king of the title); the traditionalist Tanu, looking for a return to the old ways of before the arrival of the humans; the Firvulag, who escaped from the catastrophe relatively unscathed but in uneasy alliance with Drum; the Howlers, deformed Firvulag who have finally discovered that the radioactive stone around their country is causing their problem and desiring re-integration with the main body of Firvulag society; a peace faction, led by the human operant Elizabeth; and the remnants of the Lowlives, human rebels against the Tanu, who have discovered that the aliens are poisoned by iron.Into the political bickering of these well-established factions erupts a new force.
This trilogy was amazing. May's ability to blend such a wide range of characters into the story was flawless, and the overarching story was dramatic as well. Watching each character grow as the story continued was great too. I laughed, I cried, etc.;)
Finally got around to the 3rd book in the Saga of the Exiles. I found the continuing political machinations a bit tedious. I will push through to the finale, however.
Great book - now I have to go get the next one!
Read this some 12 or so years ago, and it's so far the only part of the series that I have read. It struck some chord in me then, the expanse, there was no main character, anyone could die at anytime, the smart use of different powers...I really look forward to reading the full series and other books from Ms May. I'll go through my library, see if this my printed copy is still with me...or else I get one on Kobo or Kindle.Barnes and noble put it so eloquently below:https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/s...
It may be just me, but there are so many characters - with hard-to-pronounce names - that I found the book difficult to follow. I had to keep turning back to find out where I had met a particular character before. This detracted from the flow and, with such a complicated plot, I found I was reading just to finish the book rather than because I was involved in the story.
Entrance and adagio of Aiken-LugonnNicely set up for the fourth book. üòÅ The technical jargon for mind play can be distracting but still a masterful and mesmerizing tale.
Libro de transici√≥n, donde se recolocan las piezas tras el √©pico final del segundo volumen con vistas al pr√≥ximo final de la saga.
Just brilliant. I love the increased complexity with the added story lines of the Remillards and their quest in the past, while May stays consistent on the older parts. Will start in part 4 now.
A great edition in the story. An excellent new structure to the world made after the monumental ending of the Golden Torc, brings the characters into a changing world. It also introduces one of my favorite characters in fiction, Marc Remillard.
Storyline: 2/5Characters: 2/5Writing Style: 2/5World: 2/5The thrill is goneThe thrill is gone awayThe thrill is gone babyThe thrill is gone away I was a steadfast fan of the first in this series.
Thus the worldbuilding and environment were as exciting and significant as the plot.
Julian May's name isn't thrown around with the science fiction notables, and the Pliocene Exile isn't ranked with any of the best series.
The magic - that special paranormal turn in this science fiction tale?
Further, the writing makes reading the action scenes and "magical" system developments a chore to slog through.

Den √úberblick √ºber den gesamten Handlungsbogen des Zyklus habe ich beim ersten Band (Das vielfarbige Land) gegeben, um diese Rezension nicht weiter aufzubl√§hen verweise ich hier nur auf dieses Werk.Wiederum gibt es am Anfang des Buches eine sehr ausf√ºhrliche Zusammenfassung der bisherigen Ereignisse, die es durchaus erlauben w√ºrde, erst hier einzusteigen und dennoch alle Zusammenh√§nge sofort zu verstehen.
Die tief gezeichneten Personen die auch einer starken Entwicklung unterliegen, sind in den ersten beiden B√§nden ein sehr gro√üer Pluspunkt der Erz√§hlung.
Hier nun jedoch wird es eindeutig zu viel, es sind einfach zu viele Personen die zu detailliert geschildert werden.
Felice's destructive opening of the Gibraltar Straits has totally changed the world for the Tanu, the Firvulag and the humans who have gone back in time to the Pliocene.
Aiken is trying to rebuild and claim kingship, Nodonn is alive but cast away, Mercy has to pretend she's happy to be Aiken's queen, Elizabeth tries to help and guide, and meanwhile the operant humans are plotting from the far side of the Atlantic, and the mysterious Abaddon has plans for them all.This is so well written.
Felice is wild and super-powerful, and infatuated with the Tanu who tortured her.The plot builds, and there's no lack of mental fireworks, with several main characters being killed off.

Julian May is nothing if not thorough: she created an entire galactic civilization, replete with alien races, just to serve as backstory for her future-meets-past romp through Earth's prehistory.
Stylistically, too, she piles it on: not someone you'd describe as "spare," her prose is as purple as it gets, festooned with words from the far corners of the thesaurus.Yet it works, pretty much because all the bling-encrusted verbiage never upstages a solid, well-paced story.
It's a long read (four volumes), but you'll be sorry when it's over.
This was my least-favorite book of the series. It was bogged down in the accumulation by certain characters (mainly Aiken Drum but also others) accumulating and manifesting their telepathic powers and asserting them over others. The internal politics of the Tanu race overshadowed the relationships to the other races, but I found that mostly enjoyable. Although many of the characters engender some sympathy, I found it hard to identify with most of them - good or bad or as was often the case, in between.
On Earth, six million B.C., two species of alien ruled, the graceful humanoid Tanu and their twisted brethren, the Firvulag. Then men from twenty-second century Earth arrived through a one-way time tunnel  and soon the aliens were locked in a battle to the death, for the humans had upset the precarious balance of power that existed between them.But when the tides of combat had receded, no one group held firm control, though Aiken Drum, man of no woman born, had declared himself the Nonborn King

A fantastic third book in the series. The adventure continues as Aiken tries to consolidate his power as King of the Pliocene, the Firvulags turn on their human allies, old enemies from across the Atlantic make themselves known and someone comes back from the dead. I am really enjoying this series; one of the best SF/fantasy mix I have read in a long, long time. Everything feels slightly familiar, as if this really is a history of our oldest myths and legends. Can't wait to read the last book in the set.
I believe I began identifying more with the tanu from the end of the manycolored land and find aiken drum to be a detestable little worm who brought an end to a noble grand beautiful culture with his guns and super powers now I think I know how the Iroquoise or the Aztec felt when the white man came to their lands they invited them in and showed them how to survive and the white man repaid them with destruction.
