it's an almost plotless book with no chapter breaks and really dense prose, and most of the second half of the book is the two main guys watching some other people debate philosophy. really cool
Some sources say he is simply parodying Joyce and Gertrude Stein but the connection seems more symbiotic than that.Not much discussed in my cursory look online is the strong homosexual angle - in this purgatory, the men arrive via the Yang Gate and (not mentioned until late in the book), the entirely absent women come via the Yin. There are continual intense teenage schoolboy attachments and mincing cross-dressed sailors doing music hall turns, though with no clear point, other than Lewis's disdain for just about everyone.
Visible German militarism, and a visit to the ghetto in Warsaw, initiated the change in Lewisâ€™s politics; in 1938 Kristallnacht (November 9-10) confirmed it." - https://erea.revues.org/220 The choice of Proudhon as a symbol of anarchy & more 'liberal' politics is yet-another problematic thing here insofar as many consider Proudhon to've been a virulent anti-Semite whose views cd've certainly been inspiring to Nazis: "Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1847"On the Jews "Source: Carnets de P.J. Proudhon.
's profound importance in the history of writing it's possible that Lewis, like Pound, was a supporter of Italian culture & that that influenced his political views in the 1930s.
The Plain of Death (as its called in the book) inhabited by English Public schoolboys. In fact everyone seems to have got an old school tie (Bailiff = Dean, Hyperides = popular professor, MacRob = wise old Scottish groundskeeper). Very interesting first half, as the duo wander the landscape/time. Second half was (to use a Wyndham Lewis phrase) a crashing bore. Some parts are unreadable, like the phonetic Cockney. Now lets all sing the old school song....
what the heck did I just read?
