I saw this book in a charity shop and it brought back many memories. Absolutely loved reading this. The stories are funny. I particularly liked Mr Twiddle and the cat and Mr Twiddle and the cow.
I loved Mr Twiddle stories so much when I was a kid, I use to have the tapes and used to listen to them over and over again.
My favorites included the one where he lost the dog he was suppose to be walking and instead walked an empty lead, the one where he smokes his pen and writes with his pipe and the one with the bonfire where he put all the fireworks into the bonfire and they chased everyone around.I would so love to get these as actual books so I can relive my childhood days and read all the ones I didn't get round to listening to as a child.The Mr Twiddle stories are great, read them!
Loved rereading this as an adult. A childhood favourite of mine growing up I used to spend hours and hours laughing at mr twiddles disasters he always got himself into. As an adult reading about him still made me laugh. Poor mr twiddle always getting everything wrong all the time. The books that first got me into reading
Mr Twiddle was another of my daughters favourite stories. But then, you can't really go wrong with Blyton can you?The tales are simply timeless.
Read it when I was a kid. Was mocked for it but I love it so much and it's amazingly funny.
