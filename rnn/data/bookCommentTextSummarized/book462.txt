In a way, I wish I'd had no idea this book was about [STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT!:] a man who turns into a werewolf.
Or rather, I wish it was possible to read this book in the time it was written.
I noticed a few similarities to that book, which would have been written about 25 years before "The Door of the Unreal." That's not a bad thing, though, as "Dracula" pretty much set the standard for horror stories about creepy guys living in secluded houses, being hunted by a group of kind-hearted monster killers.
About this book I think it would've been better if it had been shorter. It goes on and on in a slow pace with nothing of note happening, the ending is also lackluster. The better part of it is probably the beginning when the reader still has some curiosity about the case.
A horror novel written in 1919, that is an early example of a particular twist and trope. You’ll only read it if I tell you what the trope is, and that wrecks the trope. So…why not wreck it? (view spoiler)[It’s an early werewolf story, similar in technique to Stoker’s Dracula. (hide spoiler)] Recommended for readers interested in the early development of the horror genre. The Librivox recording is excellent, and the LV page gives links to e-texts.This review first appeared on book coasters
I'll give it 2-3 stars.
