So how was this one?This book was written in 1938 and Ambler wears his leftist leanings quite comfortably on his sleeve.
Two of the major characters are thinly disguised Soviet agents and the whole Commie solidarity thing even gets the protagonists out of a tight spot.
He ends up being run through the paces by the aforementioned Soviet agents, a Nazi agent who fancies make-up, and the Italian OVRA, Mussolini’s secret police.
This is where the book kicks into high gear, as our hero desperately tries to dodge the Fascist black shirted government thugs.
Non solo per i film che ne sono stati tratti, ma per quel mondo, quell’immaginario che ha contribuito a costruire, con le strade di selciato bagnate immerse nella notte, illuminate da una luce improvvisa di fari, e ombre distorte e grottesche che si allungano per terra e sui muri finché si accartocciano al passaggio dell’auto scura che porta il pericolo – con le sue storie di gente comune che finisce avviluppata in macchinazioni internazionali e in giochi di spie, tra frontiere attraversate in tutti i modi, Balcani e Turchia...Maximillion Schell e Peter Ustinov a Istanbul in Topkapi di Jules Dassin, 1964, tratto da “The Light of Day”.Non stupisce che Graham Greene lo definisse senza dubbio il miglior scrittore di thriller, e per John Le Carré fosse la fonte dalla quale tutti noi attingiamo.
The reason for that is Le Carre in Spy portrayed the protagonist as vulnerable and with weaknesses like a normal human being which is different from the usual James Bond who is confident, virile, smart and all-knowing.
On the other hand, Follett in his most famous spy novel Eye is noteworthy because he incorporated treachery within a family living in a small isolated island with WWII as a backdrop and not being in the midst of the region's power political struggle.Here in Cause for Alarm, the story revolves around Nick Marlow (yes, similar to the surname of that guy who ranked the human needs) who losses his job in London because of global recession.
I looked up Eric Ambler and found that he was a British author of spy novels who used the pseudonym Eliot Reed for books co-written with Charles Rodda.
Finally, a man comes out of the office building across the street, stops to "light a cigarette" - remember that - and steps into the street where is he promptly run over twice by the same car.
He is told that the man who had the job before him was killed while walking home on a foggy night - he was hit by an automobile and the driver didn't even stop, a "very sad affair".Once he gets there he runs into all kinds of interesting people.
What fascinated me most about this was it's publication date of 1938.
The Axis of Germany and Italy had recently been established - the villain of this piece was one German in particular, and also the general fascist movement in Italy.
The protagonist is an ordinary Englishman, an engineer.
Not surprisingly, characterization is not the primary draw, though not just awful either.
This is one of Ambler's earlier pieces.
Ambler was an early writer in the spy/thriller genre and influenced the now better known Graham Greene and John Le Carre.
While I read thrillers infrequently, Eric Ambler is one I hope to turn to again.
It tells the story of an Englishman Nick Marlow who gets involved in a high stake game of espionage in Fascist Italy just before the Second World War. Marlow is an engineer who is made redundant from a London factory and due to the great depression finds it impossible to land a new job in England.
However, it is the escape from Milan through the North Eastern Italy to safety in Yugoslavia, after the Italian authorities discover the plot that Marlow is mixed in, which forms the best part of the book.
It ends well of course but there are some really hair-raising moments on the way to safety which make this a gripping suspense story.
Particolare e plausibile spy-story ambientata a Milano sul finire degli anni '30 con triplogiochisti e autorit� corrotte..
Notevole la ricostruzione degli ambienti e metodi dell'OVRA ed in genere del cot� fassista.
Incredibile come un inglese (e non tra gli impiegati del Foreign Office) avesse gi� allora inquadrato correttamente i rapporti di vicinanza ideale mista a repulsione e terrore tra Italia e Reich.
Di quella complessit� se ne parla diffusamente in Italia da non pi� di vent'anni e solo per i veramente interessati.
Peccato per il finale fatto di rincorsa e col terrore di non riuscire a chiudere il cerchio.

Eric Ambler was a great writer of spy thrillers, and a great writer, period. His books are well-written, humane, intelligent, and subtle.
"...while the central character is as realistic as you or me, the storyline is still completely implausible, which is after all what readers of spy novels want."Dear me, this hasn't aged well at all, and I couldn't wait to get to the end of this one.
But while the central character is as realistic as you or me, the storyline is still completely implausible, which is after all what readers of spy novels want.So, as with many writers who influenced those who have become household names, you're probably better off reading those they influenced and learning about their legacy from their Wikipedia posts.
Probably 4.5 stars but I will have to round it down, as it isn't a five star read.Some other reviews compare it unfavourably with Le Carre and refer to Ambler's leftist tendencies.
Of course, you might think of Chandler's creation, but I think there are more likely references to Christopher (a spy in Tudor times) and the narrator of Heart of Darkness, another story of an innocent faced with evil he cannot comprehend.
Ambler put ordinary people into extraordinary situations, helping set up the genre that Le Carre would make his own 25 years later.And it is still a pretty good read 80 years later.
In Milan Marlow is drawn into a political situation where forces seek to undermine the Rome-Berlin axis and Marlow becomes the innocent fall guy.The second half is an exciting escape story as he and the mysterious Zaleshoff try to escape to Yugoslavia, with a well plotted tale that had me at times at the edge of my seat.I felt the book was on a level with the best of modern thrillers but the aspect I most enjoyed was the picture of intrigue and politics as the second world war approaches.
'Cause for Alarm' may not be its author's best book (of those I've read 'The Mask of Dimitrios' is perhaps his most effective thriller).
But it's nevertheless a reasonably good read that, for the most part, bears many of Ambler's trademark qualities: a fascinating plot; a page-turning readability; excellent characterisation; and a strong sense of time and place.
In brief, the story features a young unemployed Brit, Nicky Marlow, who takes a job at an overseas arm of a British armaments producer, in Italy, in the late 1930s.
The sense that everything is just about to come crashing down around Europe's ears is very strong (in this the book's prophetic; it appeared in 1938), as is the depiction, through the often infuriating figure of Nicky, of English complacency in the face of the storm that was building.Much recommended.*******Although originally published in the UK in 1938, this came out in the US in 1939 and thus just squeaks in as a candidate for Rich Westwood's 1939 Challenge on his Past Offences site.My other contribution to the Challenge is a piece on the 1939 Powell & Pressburger movie 
at my Noirish site.
I love Ambler.
Reading him is like living in a great Hitchcock film for a few days.
To my way of thinking, for spy novels, Ambler and Charles McCarry are better than LeCarre.
Here's a great passage from Cause for Alarm:“The gods, like most other practical jokers, have a habit of repeating themselves too often.
Man has, so to speak, learned to expect the pail of water on his head.
The kernel of the jest is an illusion; the illusion that the simple emotional sterility, the partial mental paralysis that comes with the light of the morning, is really sanity.” 				--From Cause for Alarm
Set in Italy in 1938, Nicky Marlow is a young engineer selling British shell making machinery to the Italians. Fascist and Nazi secret services take an interest in his activities, as well as a Soviet spy, Zaleshoff.This is another terrific adventure story from Eric Ambler, as the hapless but honest Marlow finds himself (in common with most of Ambler's heroes) deep over his head in a murky world of intrigue, betrayal and murder.
This was an excellent spy novel with interesting characters and plot. Eric Ambler is a talented writer and his words just flow off the page into what I found to be a real page-turner. The novel has a classic 'noir' feeling and is very entertaining. If you like spy novels, then I am sure you would enjoy this one.
I really enjoyed reading this story. Ambler is becoming a favourite of mine. This was the second novel of his after the Mask of Dimitrios. What next?
As that hero Nick Marlow might say, it’s a rattling good yarn, with an extended manhunt worthy of Richard Hannay in 'The Thirty Nine Steps'.A severe manufacturing downturn in Britain leads Nick to take a job running the Milan branch of a British company that makes armaments for Mussolini’s government.
If I do not do it, someone else will.' (91)Good old straightforward Nick of course walks into a hotbed of corruption, double-dealing and competing spies.
There’s a creepy German who wears pancake makeup and claims to be Yugoslav, and a bluff American who might perhaps be a Russian spy.
Jolly good show, Eric old man.
Preface sets you up for another classic Ambler and highlights what a remarkable character he was himself.
The bon vivant Irish-American -- who along with other great directors from Hollywood like George Stevens and John Ford took time out to film on the frontlines at some risk to themselves -- went on to observe of Ambler: "Eric Ambler was one of the coolest men I've seen under fire.
However, it is a remarkably prescient book given it was written in the 1930's and set in Mussolini's Italy in the manner in which it treats the Axis relationship and certain sensitivities surrounding it.
Setting was good - pre-WWII - but thought the plot was a bit too straightforward - kept waiting for a twist but everything was as it was presented. Engineer loses his job in England. Obtains another job as a representative of an armaments company in Milan where he takes over from the previous person who was murdered for being involved in the same espionage he’ll become involved with.
After reading "Journey into Fear", I expected this to be slow and outdated. But the action picks up very well, with relentless manoeuvres that draw a naive technical businessman into a web of espionage. Perhaps the final chapters are less strong, but this thriller from eighty years ago still justifies the author's reputation.
Ambler was at his best in the 1930's, but his later works aren't so bad, either. This isn't his best book from the '30's, but it isn't so bad, for all that. Get ready for a delightful soak in the crazy shadow-world of Europe in that period.
Started out well but the last third dragged.
This is really 3 1/2 stars. Not as good as Alan Furst and yet, the action is good for young adult readers.
He begins to pay more attention to the morality when peculiar characters intrude more frequently into what he hoped would be routine, and then he finds out his predecessor may have been murdered, and then…Ambler is considered one of the fathers of the modern political thriller, a big influence on later writers like Graham Greene and John LeCarre -- his work is most easily compared to Hitchcock films, where a normal Jane or Joe stumbles into a situation beyond their control or understanding.
It is a typical Ambler thriller: Someone who is not a spy or an operative of any kind is caught up in a web of intrigue through which he must navigate to come out the end in one piece.
Both men, it turns out, are working for separate governments who are after information that Marlow can easily obtain because of his access to armament manufacturers throughout Italy.
Thinking that that was the way to get business, Marlow takes the bait, then finds himself caught in a web of intrigue that he must get himself out of to ultimately maintain his professional integrity and ultimately his life.
The part that lost my interest was when Marlow ends up accused of bribery by the Italian state and has to escape the country while being hunted down by the police.
This may partly have been because this book was written before this scenario had become so common and partly because Marlow would never have gotten out by himself and his co-conspirator Zaleshoff had to more or less drag him out of the country against his will.Still, the book was worth reading mostly because I liked seeing Marlow trying to do business in a corrupt and fascist Milan more or less against his will, but his escape was a bit too formulaic and mostly accomplished by someone else.
It's the late 1930s (1938?), and English narrator Marlow has just lost his job as a factory production manager.
As the plot thickens and the tension builds, we worry that Marlow may meet the same fate as his predecessor, who was the victim of a vehicular manslaughter (which we see in a brief prologue).Typical of Ambler, this book has engaging and memorable characters and a vivid setting, and the pacing carries us along quickly -- at times, pulse-poundingly.
But overall it is a very solid espionage tale set (and written) on the eve of World War II.
Usually I only manage a handful of pages before I fall asleep, and I have found this series of 1930s
