The subtitle of this book is "A Study in Modern American Culture".
That's probably what folks were looking to read about when they picked up the newly published book in 1929.
Middletown is the report of a year and a half study the Lynds and their assistants conducted in a small Midwestern city.
They approached the study like cultural anthropologists, making observations on the daily life of the city's residents.
(Well, the city's white residents, anyway.) The book is a bit of a dry read.
In the end, I enjoyed having a peek at the past but was glad that its culture wasn't my "Modern America".
Dated, but still a good study and resource to understanding how this type of study is conducted and why this methodology is important and relevant.
Enjoyed getting a visit visit with the Muncie of my grandparents and great grandparents.
