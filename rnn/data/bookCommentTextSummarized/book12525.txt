I've read this book a thousand times, and I've just realized how mundane it is. Most of the problem is that all but this reading took place when I was in junior high and high school - I read ANYTHING I could get my hands on, and so I read a LOT of Danielle Steel. The plot of this one is still on of my favorites, but the writing isn't great. They make the same joke at least three times, and I don't think you're supposed to notice.
انتهيت منها في 5 ساعات , كانت جيده .لكل من يريد قصصا خفيفه بنهايه سعيده .. اليكم دانيال ستيل !
This is my third reading this book and I never feel tired of it.
But I think the truth behind the story is about second chance to love and to forgive ourselves.
This book really swept my heart every time I read it.
The friendship between Bill and Adrian brought them together and been meaning to start a whole new life.
They shared their sorrows, supports each other and their friendship deepens into love.
I enjoy reading the book thoroughly and never get tired of it.
It is also full of motivation, self-help, love, forgiveness and second chance to seek happiness.
I believe that this is my first Danielle Steel book.
I've liked other romances, but I have to say that this was not my favorite.
The plot was weak, the characters cardboard.
I could tell you what was going to happen in the end from about page 30.
It was a long and painful process getting there.
**stop here for spoilers *** The only surprise was when she came with the boys and Bill on the vacation and saved Tommy from drowning in the river.
Our heroine gets pregnant.
I think I won't read any more Daneille Steele.
I wonder why so many people like her books.
Worst book I've ever had the misfortune to pick up. I will never read another DS book.
Cuando late un corazon.Muy buena ,me ha gustado .una historia que le toca el corazón a quien la lea.narrada eficientemente y respetuosamente aunque esperaba un epílogo y eso me decepciono.muy recomendada.
Heartbeat tells the story of two people who face the heartbreak of their spouses leaving them.
fThis book was really well written and I did have a hard time putting it down.
At times I just wanted to yell at Adrian to stop being an idiot, but had she actually listened to me then there would be far less drama in the book.As amazing as this book was, I couldn't help being bothered by the inconstant way Bill was portrayed.
In the beginning he was such a jerk, and suddenly presto-changeo he became the ideal man that any woman would want.
It was odd.Other than that, fantastic book.
This book is great if you want a light read considering it was pretty simplistic.
I have to mention it was repetitive and I personally didn't feel the characters were convincing enough meaning there wasn't a lot of depth to them.
Overall its not as bad as people say, it was predictable yes, but it is a romance novel from the early 90's..
& anyway it does have that soap opera feel to it in terms of writing which means the dialog between characters can be shallow and bland.
All this and the basic plot can actually make it quite frustrating to read.
The extraordinary thing about this, is that I read about half of this book before getting to a scene which I suddenly realized I'd already read. So either there's a very similar scene (during the camping trip), or I read this book ages ago. I know many years ago I read some Danielle Steel novels while visiting my sister-in-law... I guess this must have been one of them. But aside from that one scene, nothing else felt familiar. Very strange. This amnesia didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. Fine for last days of holiday.

I don't know why i read this book. Maybe because everyone talks about Danielle Steel. I didn't enjoy it, the writing isn't good. But i don't want left it unfinish, so i think it's the worst reading experiment in this year. Sorry
This book wasn't that great. Way too predictable. Adrian's husband's character was just unbelievable and the romance between her and Bill was way too drawn out. I didn't really care about the soap opera either. I was more interested in characters they mentioned once or twice.
A wonderful fast moving story. I enjoyed the storyline and the characters. Miss Steel has a way with words.

Read this one way back in 1996!!
Read multiple times.
This book was so wonderfully and carefully written. It was the first book I read by Danielle Steel, and it made me want to read all her books. :D
Wanneer zij onverwachts zwanger blijkt te zijn, blijkt haar huwelijk toch niet zo stevig en liefdevol te zijn als ze dacht.Bill is een succesvolle serieschrijver, hij werkt dagen en nachten en door toeval ziet hij Adrian voor het eerst bij de nachtelijke boodschappen.
Op dat moment begint het te knagen bij Bill.
Naarmate het verhaal vordert groeien Bill en Adrian op een bijzondere manier naar elkaar toe.
Personages wisselen elkaar vloeiend af zonder dat je het door hebt of niet snapt.
Het is een logisch opgebouwd verteld verhaal.
Zo simpel als een verhaal maar kan zijn, zo makkelijk het te lezen is.
Esta história tem algumas partes interessantes, embora pobremente escritas. A mente de um workaholic, dois divórcios e os bastidores de uma telenovela. Mas as personagens são aborrecidas e muito planas: ou são más, ou são boas. E quando começa o romance entre o Bill e a Adrian o meu interessa acabou mesmo por desaparecer e parei ai a leitura do livro.
I'm reading this book because I got it from a friend. This is her genre and, for her, I'm giving it a whirl. 😀UPDATE: I practically devoured this book and I'm kind of upset about it. LOL I liked the characters... they made me crazy like real people do so they were well written. I don't think I will actively seek out another Danielle Steel book but I would read another if given to me by my friend. 😁
One message that rises above all others in this book is broken relationships are painful. Both Adrian and Bill didn’t want divorces. Adrian’s husband left her because she’d become pregnant. Bill’s wife left him because he made his work more important than her.What a great insight into relationships that go wrong, then go right.
well it as not as tragic as usual , u know daniel steel , shallow and repeating herself a lot but she manages to give u an easy reading specially if u r like me , english is not your mother tongue, her language is easy . and she puts u in a positive mood
Entertaining read and I liked the main couple enough. I also want to say that Adrian's ex-husband is a complete douche-prick for how he left her. While it was fun I wasn't as invested as Silent Honor.
Ugh! The only thing Adrian got right throughout the entire story was she really didn't deserve Bill at all! Bill is the only reason why I'm giving this book 3 stars - the guy deserves so much more than Adrian..
not bad,not too good and i'll stop reading love novels that's too much for one year
<3 <3 <3
I'm not used to read romantic novels, but I gotta admit this one was really good! A sweet love story as if seeing a classic movie.
This was quite the touching tale. I didn't have any qualms with the characters. Great storyline and everything wrapped together nicely in this novella.
كل قصة للكاتبة شيء جديد غير مكرر عالم قائم بحد ذاته. اعجبني الحبكة.
Simple straight forward plot, but a fun read
