EDIT AUGUST 31, 2012:Book comes out at 12:01 EST and I just wanted to say, one more time: THANK YOU ALL FOR THE MOST AMAZING YEAR!To my Kickstarter contributors who funded me while I wrote this book - I won't forget you and you are immortal in your special edition copies.
And thank you...for being the most amazing fans - ever.------------------------------------------------------------------------A note for those of you waiting for the sequel, Seduced in the Dark, BEFORE you read Captive in the Dark: I meant for you to have a break between these two books.
CJ Roberts has written an outstanding novel with a twisted and yet beautiful love story, multi-layered, complex characters that will test the boundaries of your heart and mind, a plot that will captivate and disturb you but at the same time leave you unable to turn away, and a raw, gritty, brutal world of betrayal, revenge, honor, lust, and love.
and yet at the same time this book opened my heart and mind to things I never thought I could possibly accept.This book starts off four months after the end of book 1, Captive in the Dark.
BEST.FUCKING.BOOK.EVER !!!!
Firstly , before I get on with this review , CJ love this is for you   Oh my dear lord , I am out of words to describe what an amazing book this has turned out to be .
Honestly speaking and  no offense to reviewers who have reviewed it  words cannot comply or even describe or make you realize how good this book is .
I mean , no matter what I write here or what you've already read about it can in no way make you experience the intensity of this story .
I mean , no matter what I write here or what you've already read about it can in no way make you experience the intensity of this story .
With the kind of cliff hanger we were left with in Captive in the Dark , I was dying to find out what was in store for Caleb and Livvie and boy oh boy was I choking with all sorts of emotions when I finished reading it .
Infinite stars to this one from , its definitely a MUST READ !CJ Roberts , for such an amazing story :

"Once upon a time, Caleb held me captive in the dark, now he used it to seduce me."   And the story of Caleb and Livvie continues... Again, it's a very intense, dark, powerful and highly captivating story that constantly kept me on the edge of my seat while reading it. To be honest, this book probably wasn't that good for my mental health...the last few chapters got me so worked up and I was so anxious to finish it that I nearly felt like crying if I didn't find out soon how the story ended...
"Once upon a time, Caleb held me captive in the dark, now he used it to seduce me."
At the end of Captive in the Dark we learn that Caleb has informed Livvie of his plan to train her and sell her as a pleasure slave to his biggest enemy Demitri Balk (aka Vladek Rostrovich).
Just like in the first part of the series, there are some very twisted, mind-boggling scenes in Seduced in the Dark but in the end, it all makes perfect sense as to why everything happened the way it did...
It’s a little confusing to begin with but the story is so dynamic, you’re soon sucked in and it may start out slowly but it gathers pace like a runaway train.We start with Olivia incarcerated in the present in a mental institution being interrogated by the FBI, by an agent with his own dark sexual proclivities, sometime after the events of the book and also the story is told in retrospect as we pick up Olivia and Caleb where we left them at the end of Captive.At the start of this book, Olivia is a lifetime away from the person she was at the beginning of Captive – she’s been bitchslapped into womanhood by her experiences.
He told her he wasn't her prince charming, but what he hadn't said, was he wished he could be... Many readers struggle to decide whether or not this series is one they'd recommend due to its explicit, no-holds-barred topics and darkly disturbing scenarios--and rightfully so. Upon completion of this emotionally conflicting series, I can safely say that I in fact WOULD recommend these books; although not without fair warning. As you have probably already discovered, these books are not easy reads
Upon completion of this emotionally conflicting series, I can safely say that I in fact WOULD recommend these books; although not without fair warning.
Seduced in The Dark took this emotions miles further...Seduced kicks off with a heartbreaking visual of Livvie in her declining and destructive mental state.
Never before have I been so emotionally conflicted while reading a book.
You can actually FEEL Caleb's internal frustration as he struggles to push away the unfamiliar feelings of love creeping in; willing himself to focus on his original plan of revenge.
We are presented with details of Caleb's past and it is actually more heartbreaking than I could have imagined.
Still that doesnt justify his awful actions but reading the epilogue I understood many things about him.The last chapter and the epilogue.I never thought that I would cry so much with this book.I was a sobbing mess and hate it when it's happening.All started when Caleb said:"I love you Livvie."He put the key in the ignitation and drove away.“Live for me, Kitten.
"Kitten," he said, "monsters can't love."  By the time I reached the halfway point of this book, I was ready to slap a big fat 1 star rating on this review and write a vengeful spiel. Yes, that's right. 1 star. I was seeing red. I was RAGING with fury.So, you ask, "why now the 4 star rating?" Well, let's see...  It felt wrong to fantasize about such things - but Caleb didn't care. Fantasies were all he could have and no one could take them from him.  This book would have been complete shit wit
By the time I reached the halfway point of this book, I was ready to slap a big fat 1 star rating on this review and write a vengeful spiel.
It felt wrong to fantasize about such things - but Caleb didn't care.
This book would have been complete shit without Caleb's point of view.
The only way this book was going to work meant that Caleb's bad side had to continue to show on the outside while he was struggling internally with the idea of how to let down his guard.
OMG!!Caleb...I fell in love for the boy he once was..My heart broke when I read his story and I hated the man he became while trying to be what Rafic expected of him...There are times when you will absolutely hate him and wonder why Olivia would even fall in love with him.But then in the end for me he is worthy of her love...
What I enjoyed most about this book was reading about Caleb and Livvie falling in love.The sweet moments he would let her call him by his name and he would call her Livvie and not Pet.They were so tender and real, giving the book such emotion..Loved every emotion this book gave me “Kiss me,” she whispered.
Dealing with Caleb was all about perspective. You couldn’t appreciate his kindness until you’d felt his cruelty. What a Wicked Erotic Feast!! Holy Hell, I am a sick fuck!! How can my heart belong to murdering, human trafficking, rapist!?!? And not only did I fall for him, I wanted him to have a HEA befitting a true hero. But Caleb is no prince charming. He is the monster that nightmares are made of. Caleb Olivia has been through hell. She's been beaten, abducted, raped, and told that she will b
I’d fallen in love with his smell and his taste; his smile, kindness, and yes, even his cruelty because I knew it was a part of him.
Caleb has wanted Livvie from the moment he laid eyes on her.
“I don’t want revenge, Caleb.
I don’t want to end up like you, letting some fucking vendetta run my life.
I want to be free, Caleb.
You will experience a vast range of emotions while reading this book.
You will hate a character one moment, then feel sympathy or love for them two chapters later.
5 KITTEN STARS ★★★★★ “He was there to tell me I was beautiful.
He was there to tell me I was going to be okay.
In the dark, he seduced me.
I didn’t want the seduction to end.”  WOW.
This book just catapulted the series from a 3.5 stars to a 5 stars one for me.
So to say that I am completely blown away by this read is mildly putting it.
Honestly after seeing all the buzz on this series and not entirely loving the first one, I thought I was going to be in the minority but damn.
I love being proved
I love being proved wrong.The first book definitely laid down the right amount of groundwork for Caleb & Livvie aka 'Kitten', setting the tone of the series and later propelled 
Put them both together, you'll feel the turmoil of emotions they put you through because in the most unimaginable ways, they found love in the darkness.
“Once upon a time, Caleb held me captive in the dark, now he used it to seduce me.”
This is a read that many will find it hard to stomach, leave you shaken to its core but you'll walk out of it feeling like you've just witnessed something epic and lastly, a sense of loss to see it end.
http://samsawesomness.blogspot.com/20... *Spoiler Free* "His touch was simple, but specific, meant to show me he could be like a lover, gentle, intimate, but also that he was a man unaccustomed to hearing the word no. Yes. I understood. He was a man, and I? I was nothing but a girl, not even a woman. I was meant to fall at his feet and worship at the altar of his masculinity, grateful that he’d deigned to acknowledge me. All this, from a simple touch." - C.J. Roberts (Captive in the Dark)In 2011
Mrs. Roberts challenged me in so many ways as a reader, she took me completely out of my comfort zone, she gave me an anti-hero that I should have hated and made me love him!
By the time I finished, I was a hot mess of emotions, and that little masochist in me wanted more of this story desperately!
I was fortunate enough to be a beta reader for this book, and thus begins my journey into The Dark Duet #2.This will not be a plot review, as I don't want to spoil anything for the reader.

I shouldn’t love it.I mean he is a sick fuck, a child stolen from his parents, sold as a whore and then trained to a cold hearted killer who kidnaps girls and trains them to be sex slaves all for his quest for revenge.
- - Livvie But WOW I fucking love them.
I loved this book.
The feelings I had throughout was just AMAZING *sigh*!I LOVE IT!
- There is also an amazing Video on CJ Roberts wall that a fan has made.
Jesus H...I am gutted. I can't even function right now. There will never be another story I will love as much. Holy hell CJ. Just...wow. I have no words that would do this story justice. No words.
FIVE++ EMOTIONALLY RAW & EROTIC STARS “Live for me, Kitten. Be all those things you’d never be with me. Go to school. Meet a normal boy and fall in love. Forget me.” **Sob, sob, sob, sob** Oh God, just typing those words makes me cry. I fucking loved this book. I love it so much. I can’t believe it’s over. I felt nothing but hollow inside after it was done. Whatever words that I spew out for this review will never do it justice.  Never had I wanted to laugh, and weep, and fuck, and devour an
I fucking loved this book.
It seemed to Caleb, the nature of human being revolved around one empirical truth: we want what we cannot have.
Ever since Livvie came into this life, he’s been rethinking this whole revenge thing, but he doesn’t want to disappoint Rafiq.
Livvie acts like she wants to run away with him; to only love him.
Even after all the mind games, the torment, the heartaches that Caleb dishes out, there is no doubt Livvie is in love with him.
Caleb constantly tests her will, trying to push her away, but she is one tough and stubborn woman.
5 EROTICALLY DARK AND DEMENTED STARS.There are the kinds of books that come along once in awhile that leave you feeling like you've just had a mind, body and soul experience! The second book in the Dark Duet Series, Seduced in the Dark is that kind of book. As I was reading the book I felt so many intense emotions. It was brilliantly mind numbing, gripping and dark. "Tears ran down my face unabashed, but I didn't move to wipe them away. I had earned those tears, and I would wear them as a symbol
5 EROTICALLY DARK AND DEMENTED STARS.There are the kinds of books that come along once in awhile that leave you feeling like you've just had a mind, body and soul experience!
As I was reading the book I felt so many intense emotions.
We start out with Livvie in a hospital talking about her time with Caleb and are taken through the months of her captivity and slavery.
It’s a real mind f*ck at times, you struggle internally with the monster Caleb is and the way Livvie see’s him.
It’s one of the best books I have EVER read.
"5 Mine! stars"  “Mine.The word was a declaration. It rocked him to his very foundation. It was a truth he’d kept hidden for far too long. Caleb didn’t know anything about love, or loving anyone, but he knew… Livvie was his.”  This is one of those times where I struggle to write a review to express my mountain size feelings in words. Until a few months back I was terrified of reading anything DARK even if it had HEA and now I can gladly say reading “Tears of Tess” is the best decision I’ve made.
I know that Caleb is far from being the knight in a shining armour, I hated Caleb for better part of this story, he’s a monster in disguise who kidnapped, abused and tormented Livvie in ways nobody would wish it on their worst enemy, he’s a monster a seducer your worst nightmare but knowing him, seeing the world from his eyes and feeling his emotions will tear you apart, he has come to love and care in her company, she became his strength, his light in darkness, his salvation.
Now in route to meet with Rafiq, Caleb knows his time with Livve is limited.
He is very aware of the fact that someday she may seek revenge against him.Tug of WarAs revenge powered Caleb to do some unthinkable things.**Shivers** His loyalty to Rafiq seemed to only increase the onslaught of pain he inflicted on Livve most of which was done emotionally.
Why won't my face stop leaking!' -Livvie's inner monologue"Steady Kitten I won't let him inside you.
-Where is Caleb?-What the fuck happened?My RatingsCharacters- Strong Willed and LovableWriting Style- Excellent!
From the first word to the last, you wont be disappointed!!!Okay, I’m not gonna lie, I was kinda upset cuz the beginning of the story was just like a book I’d already read so the epicness of my anticipation for the book went down a peg.
Felipe, an associate of Rafiq’s, has housed Caleb and Livvi aka Kitten so he can train her to be a proper slave for the unsuspecting Vladek.
During this training Caleb feels things he’s never felt and is falling for Kitten.
Caleb takes what is his and wont let go of Kitten.
In the end the student exceeds his teacher.Present: Agent Reed has been questioning Livvi for days and at first she reveals nothing.
You wanted to hold her while she cried and tell her it would be okay-or just take her and run the fuck out of there.
I wanted to hate him and a part of me did, but when I got glimpses of the Caleb that could love another person or the Caleb that felt remorse for the things he'd done-or even the Caleb that would let himself feel...something other than the lust for revenge, I knew that deep within his rage and anger, he was just one fucked up lost soul that needed to be saved.
Absolutely amazing!
I have not been this captivated by a book, by a series, in years!
Thank you to everyone who told me to read these.
The bad news...I've neglected so many other things, like sleep, for the past few days!
I needed to get lost in a book like I did this one, actually two.
Caleb is one sick mother...
The way this book starts broke my heart!
No spoilers but one review I read helped me "compartmentalize" my grief and move on.
Let's just say it worked.I plan to read something light and funny...
Thanks for a great read!!!
There were times I thought I couldn’t go on and my resolve was sorely testedMy chest ached, my stomach was in knots and more than once I felt physically sick with the anticipation of what was about to happen.Reading this book I felt that CJ must be one of the most talented writers I’ve ever read.
She is a storyteller who certainly doesn’t shy away from what she feels needs to be told, even if, at times, this makes the reader uncomfortable and takes them to a place they thought they could never go.The reader is taken from the time Livvie is captured and from there she recounts how her predicament evolved and how Caleb and the others played a part in her story.
“Once upon a time, Caleb held me captive in the dark, now he used it to seduce me.” This book is DARK and very captivating, crazy good, deep and it will probably make your therapist rich! “He had told her he wasn't her Prince Charming, but what he hadn't said, was he wished he could be Yupp, Thats Caleb! A dark knight... A zombie with a heart beat, A monster just like 'Beast' from Beauty and the Beast. A monster with a heart of gold.We want what we cannot have. For Eve, it was the fruit of the
This book is DARK and very captivating, crazy good, deep and it will probably make your therapist rich!
‘If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep’                      – William ShakespeareI feel so giggy happy and so glad that I read this book at last!
We learn so much about Caleb's past, about things which lead to him being where he is today.The book hurts, its like a punch in the gut!
It makes you want to kill.I really liked the book, I loved all the side characters and I am glad they will be getting a spinoff!Agent Reed!!
"You could not sell me...I could stay with you...be with you?"  Vivisected. On-off-buzz-buzz-on-off. Caleb I miss you.  I didn't expect this story to begin the way it did. Maybe if I had known, I wouldn't have hesitated for so long before starting this. I expected to start where I left off in Captive in the Dark, scared of Rafiq's arrival, but to my surprise I was pushed into the present and all my questions on how Livvie and Caleb's story unfolded were left in the past, to be revealed later on
I expected to start where I left off in Captive in the Dark, scared of Rafiq's arrival, but to my surprise I was pushed into the present and all my questions on how Livvie and Caleb's story unfolded were left in the past, to be revealed later on in the book.
I got a clear insight on Livvie's thoughts and feeling for Caleb through this book.
I understood how someone can fall in love with a person like Caleb.
Even though I started off thinking I might not like this...I can say, with all my heart, that I couldn't have asked for a better story.
5++ stars  ”If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep.”  Seduction in the Dark begins with Livvie waking up in a hospital having survived the final days of her captivity, everything is a blur and as the story goes we re-live the events that led her to how she got to where she is today. At first she’s not ready; she is holding herself captive by staying silent. She’s grieving, her master is gone and she is all alone.   Slowly, I crawl under my covers. I want to go back to sleep. I want to be wit
Seduction in the Dark begins with Livvie waking up in a hospital having survived the final days of her captivity, everything is a blur and as the story goes we re-live the events that led her to how she got to where she is today.
Livvie knows what she has to do, she has to share their story, that's the only way
Caleb is torn, choosing between Livvie and the man he owed everything too, the one who saved him and made him the man he is today, he has to make Rafiq understand, there has to be another way
And you’re mine, only mine.” - LivvieAs good as it is, the first book in this duet, Captive in the Dark seems but a mere warm-up to the ingeniously told story, beautifully complex character development of both Caleb and Livvie (Kitten), soul searing emotion, torrid eroticism and unexpected conclusion found in Seduced in the Dark.
Every time Livvie breaches his guarded damaged heart, like a wave rushing back to the sea, he doubles down on his Mastery over her body and attempts to prepare her for the sexual slavery that Rafiq and he have planned for her as part of their plans for revenge on the man to whom she will be sold as a virgin sex slave.Ultimately, Caleb makes a choice.
Me gustó la forma en que está estructurado el libro, ya que inicia con Livvie en un hospital, recuperándose de una serie de heridas y siendo interrogada por dos agentes del FBI acerca de su secuestro.
La única pega, al menos de la primera mitad, es que la novela se alarga mucho con las reflexiones de la protagonista y además, se introduce una relación entre dos personajes secundarios, que no tiene ni ton ni son en el argumento y que no llega a ninguna parte, absolutamente innecesaria.Por supuesto, seguí odiando a Caleb la mayor parte del libro, a pesar de su conflicto interno entre la lealtad hacia su “mentor” y sus sentimientos hacia Livvie.
4.5* the last of us STARS!!*After read the first chapter*I kept chanting in my head that isn't really happened. Previously on Captive in the Dark... Livvie thinks she could change his mind to keep her but Caleb still insist to sell her for revenge. Caleb trained Livvie to be a perfect obedient slave but she managed to survive him. For now.  “Some stories aren't black and white.”  It begins when Livvie was rescued placed in some kind of hospital ward and under supervised by Dr. Sloan. Agent Matth
Caleb trained Livvie to be a perfect obedient slave but she managed to survive him.
Livvie has a several mental breakdown because she couldn't handle the life without Caleb.
Caleb really acts like a lover to Livvie.
This is the only thing I hated from him (view spoiler)[He fucked Celia in front of Livvie just to prove he will let her go.
Caleb chose Livvie and they create a sexy moment together in the monster's nest.A love story between two damaged souls in the most fucked up way.
Caleb couldn't change his past but he can chose his own future.
I need a minute WOW that was a complete rollercoaster ride...I feel like I can finally breathe. Let me just start with  Confusion, anxiety, angst, ugly cry, anger, RAGE, and excitement!! Yes I felt all of these things. At first I was so confused with the now and then just going back and forth I was having a hard time keeping up. We meet two new characters so I was like wtf?! Where's Caleb, what's going on? Lol But once I finally got into the story it consumed me and I devoured it in a day I just
I need a minute WOW that was a complete rollercoaster ride...I feel like I can finally breathe.
Where's Caleb, what's going on?
I went from loving him to hating him to loving him to wanting to hurt him lol.
The things he made Kitten go thru made me want to go bat shit on him lol
And when she made Caleb jealous I was flipping excited!
Kitten: "I don't want revenge, Caleb.
I don't want to end up like you, letting some fucking vendetta run my life.
I want to be free, Caleb.
