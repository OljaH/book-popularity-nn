Weber is mentioned so often in subsequent texts that it become necessary to read his work just to be in the loop.
In that regard, one should read his book.That said, the early chapters were for me better than some of the latter.
(How ironically Popper-ian to miss the way that Weber does!)Moreover, he is writing during the initial period of charismatic leaders.
His work is still interesting, but so much has been learned that has greater pertence an specificity for those particularly interested in the politics of charismatic leaders.That said, Webers work is a turning point within academic thought and should be read.
Weber its the source himself. Sometimes criticized of being too abstract or that his models were way to idealistic, nevertheless, he dissects the anatomy of power, and nails the concept of "Bureaucracy" as a new -and better- way of organize human work as is the platform needed for the planning and coordination of labour first introduced by Taylor, and justified by Chandler as the "Visible Hand". A must-read if you hope to understand modern organizations, and our actual world.
Mediocre, bland, I didn't get much from this book that I can recall. Rather off the spot, and sketchy.
Wanna know the basic in politics? This book is a must!
