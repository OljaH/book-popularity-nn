For me, that angle was probably the most intriguing thing about the first two MOON books, and I was rather annoyed to find that, here, Burroughs just drops the whole concept entirely, as though hoping that no one would notice his complete failure to resolve the one overarching thread that joins this trilogy together.Apart from that major complaint, however, THE RED HAWK is actually surprisingly good.
There is tons of action and all the usual Burroughs staples: kidnapped princess, brawny hero, alien bad guys, prison break, etc.
Decepcionante. El clásico héroe que rescata princesas y descubre civilizaciones perdidas, es, en el caso de La Luna, bastante más flojo que en las más conocidas series de Marte / Barsoom o Venus y Pellucidar o el clásico Tarzán.El esquema narrativo repetido una y otra vez en este caso no parece llegar a la agilidad de las demás series de Burroughs.
Burroughs breaks from his mold in this series. The Moon Men, almost totally breaks from his established writing formula. He had a weakness for writing Adventure Romance and had to have the "boy meets girl" theme. I would be willing to bet that The Moon Men was one of the first novels of the Post-Apoc genre.
Not bad for probably the MOST racist, sexist and classiest book I've ever read. By far it still it wasn't the worst story, and for it's time it was extremely original. It's epic, taking place over a 300 yr period, and involving a Battlefield Earth sort of tale.I wouldn't say it's for everyone, but anyone who's a fan of classic SF might find it a fun read.
Nos narra las 3 reencarnaciones en primera perdona de un fulano. Siempre luchando por una bella dama y contra la hostilidad de otra raza.
