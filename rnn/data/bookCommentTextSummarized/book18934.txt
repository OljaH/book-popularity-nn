5 Demon Dodging Stars *Spoilers*First read 2/24/2014 Reread 11/24/2015"I know you have vampire hit men, so why wouldn't you have vampire private investigators, too?" she flared back. "I can't just run an ad with Nathanial's description on it titled 'Have you seen this soul welsher?'"-Denise "No." She blinked. "No?" "I understand your confusion," Spade said smoothly, "since it seems you don't hear that word often, but allow me to explain. It means I'm not your employee. It means you'll need to do
The demon tells Denise that a relative of hers named Nathanial that sold his soul to him and for power then ran.
Spade knows Bones and Cat have a lot on their plate right now so he is going to do what he can to help Denise.
Can Spade and Denise find Nathanial in time to save her family and keep her from becoming a demon?As soon as she did, she shoved him away hard enough to make him take a step backward.
It was nice seeing Denise get a new HEA after reading her husband's death in a previous Bones and Cat novel, and Spade was perfect for her!
“I don’t lack for bed partners, so I don’t need to scrounge for unwilling scraps.”Denise’s response to Spade on whether she’s okay after freaking out in the middle of a vampire party:“About three miles from Crazytown with my foot on the pedal, I’d say.”Spade internally berating himself on his attraction to Denise: “Fool, he lashed himself.
A vibrator can last all night, too, vampire.”Spade cooing to Denise (in cat form) to try and have her shift back:“Denise,” he said low.
So many nice ideas but nothing really fleshed out (minimal world building, thin plot, flat secondaries, etc.) But I came into these spin off series expecting a PNR novel.
The only thing important to me was a remotely believable plot and a likable h/h couple.
I got none of that.The whole story was one huge plot hole.
I have already accepted that creating an engaging and unpredictable multilayered plot isn’t one of Frost’s strong points.
But until now she did manage to aptly describe the attraction between her h/h couple.
First Drop of Crimson was a bunch of PNR clichés and a stupid heroine put together.
Denise sighed. “I’ll be twenty-eight on my next birthday.”“I’ll be two hundred and fifty-seven on my next birthday,” Spade replied. Spade aka Charles aka Baron Charles DeMortimer is Bones best friend. And has been a widower for a few hundred years. He did not love his wife.Denise is Cat’s best friend. And has been a widow recently. She loved her husband. Spade wants Denise and Denise wants Spade  Spade brushed her hair back with a light, caressing stroke. She wished his fingers felt lifeless a
Spade aka Charles aka Baron Charles DeMortimer is Bones best friend.
He did not love his wife.Denise is Cat’s best friend.
But Denise resists because she still loves her husband and because he was killed by supernatural beings.
The last thing she wants is to be with a vampire.So, Spade will do everything that he can to seduce her without forcing himself to her, because he is a good guy and he has already lost a human girl that he loved before by a few bad guys.
Denise did not know who to ask for help and Bones’ best friend was a good choice.
Oh yeah, and to make sure she cooperates, he leaves her with some demon "brands" that could turn her into a demon shape-shifter like him along with unique qualities to her blood that could threaten her very existence and make her a valuable commodity to the vampire underworld.So Spade arrives, finds Denise "branded" by a demon and listens to her plans of finding the elusive Nathanial, and since he's adamant that she doesn't involve Cat and Bones in her plan, he reluctantly agrees to help her in their place.
We took a break from Cat and Bones and got the story of a couple of their friends pairing up.
It was Spade, Bones old vamp buddy, and Denise, Cat's human best friend.
With Cat and Bones half the world away Denise calls Spade, the only other vamp she knows, for help.
It is a shame as I liked the first few books and was hoping a break from Cat and Bones would rekindle my enthusiasm for the world and the secondary characters.
Wow, well, this is the first book in the Night Huntress World (spin-offs from the Night Huntress series) and focused on two characters that Frost's other novels have only touched upon briefly: Spade and Denise.
Spade is your centuries-old, English (and, of course, sexy) vampire and Denise is the recent widow of Randy, a man killed by forces of the dark and supernatural world.
Denise was likeable but less impressive because I'm used to the spunky and brave Cat. She did improve throughout the novel, shedding a lot of her timidity that I suppose can be excused after her husband got ripped apart by a zombie.I will definitely read Eternal Kiss of Darkness about Mencheres.
I knew it was PNR.
I just didn't know it was generic PNR.
I liked reading more about Spade and enjoyed his character.
It was nice to see Cat and Bones and Mencheres and Ian (who I have a new perspective on).And then there was Denise.
Denise is a TSTL heroine.
Her internal whining about how Spade could never love her because she's human just about drove me to drink.
Seriously, most.annoying.heroine.ever.
Spade is hot!Edited to add: I can't believe I forgot to mention Ian. He is hot, but cannot be trusted.
First Drop of Crimson is the first book in the Night Huntress World series.
Straight up, you need to read this series in order.
The first book, Halfway to the Grave, introduces the Night Huntress world and each book thereafter contains major spoilers.
I was left wanting more.To conclude, I loved Spade in the Night Huntress series and was a tad upset that this book wasn't better.
I love Jeaniene Frost's writing and story telling, and an okay read from her won't in any way stop me from continuing to be a big fan of hers.
4.5 Demonic Stars!! I first read this back in 2011, at the time it was probably the book I enjoyed the least in this wonderful spin-off series. For some reason I decided to revisit Spade and Denise and I must admit I enjoyed it very much this time around. Spade is ever the gallant gentleman vampire, but, we also get to see his overprotective ruthless vampire side when it comes to saving Denise from a Demon.Denise has been separated from her vampire friends since her husband Randy's brutal death
For some reason I decided to revisit Spade and Denise and I must admit I enjoyed it very much this time around.
Denise is still struggling with PTSD and has really bad moments when in certain situations, but, Spade manages to gain her trust and sooth her through these difficult episodes.
We get appearances from our favorite naughty vampire Ian and naturally Cat, Bones, and Mencheres.
I thoroughly enjoyed my reread and upped my original three star rating.Favorites Quotes:❤️
Off to reread Mencheres and Kira's book Eternal Kiss of Darkness..........Originally read: September 2011
I love Jeaniene Frost's The Night Huntress series and I was so excited that Slade, Bone’s best friend, was finally getting his own book. Slade was always an interesting character in TNH series….gorgeous, mysterious…not as outgoing as Bones but still as fabulous!

I love Jeaniene Frost's The Night Huntress series and I was so excited that Slade, Bone’s best friend, was finally getting his own book.
The Night Huntress World series, the spin off from The Night Huntress series starts with First Drop of Crimson and follows Spade and Cat’s best friend, Denise’s story.Denise has been marked by a demon and Spade helps her track down the demon and her ancestors, who play a role on her being “terrorized” by the very bad and seemingly indestructible demon.I loved the tension and attraction between the two of them.
They are such a good match.I enjoyed their back-story and how much they helped each other.Cat & Bones make an appearance…which gave me my C&B fix!!!!!If you like the Night Huntress series, you will love this one!!!
Spade doesn’t care for humans, only for blood and sex, when he gets a frantic call from Denise a woman whose stayed in his mind, he finds out it’s up to him to help her in order to save her and the lives of her family before the demon comes a calling.
As their journey has them hopping all over the world in search for the man the demon wants, Spade finds he can’t fight the building emotions he has toward Denise, Spade is willing to lay it all on the line and his heart to protect and be with Denise forever...
Watch out, Bones! Spade is heeeerrre!  First Drop of Crimson is the first book in the Night Huntress World (NHW) series. Although it is technically a different series, these books are meant to be read in order of the publication date, meaning there is some back and forth between this series and the Night Huntress (NH) series. This is supposed to be read after NH #4. The focus is on two secondary characters from the NH series, Spade, Bones’ best friend & Denise, Cat’s best friend. Before rea
Denise doesn’t know what to do or who to turn to, so in trying to get in touch with Cat and/or Bones, she ends up speaking with Spade.
The funny thing about this particular partnership is that Denise wants nothing to do with vampires and Spade feels the same way about humans.
I had always loved Spade, but didn’t really have feelings for Denise one way or another from the NH series, but I REALLY LOVED them both in this book!
It is told in third person, so we get to see what both Denise and Spade are thinking and feeling throughout the book.
We get a vampire versus demon clash, and the transformation of human Denise into something different.Denise’s whole family is dying and it’s a little suspicious to Denise, being aware of the things that go bump in the night.
Being a part of their world has brought her nothing but pain, but it seems that depending on one vamp in particular might end up saving her life.Spade is a master vampire, ruling over his people, until he gets a call from a woman, he’s been trying to forget, a very human woman.
This is the first book in the Night Huntress World series, a spinoff from the glorious Night huntress series. Dennis MacGregory, best friend to legendary Cat Crawfield. She been through so much shit but still hella strong and sassy AF “Don’t you ‘Denise’ me,” she snapped, “I don’t care how old, powerful, or strong you are. If you ever do something like that again, I’ll stab you n the heart. You son of a bitch, I can’t believe you threw me off a plane!” Spade old powerful vampire which makes him
“Don’t you ‘Denise’ me,” she snapped, “I don’t care how old, powerful, or strong you are.
Spade old powerful vampire which makes him little old-fashioned
“No?”“I understand your confusion,” Spade said smoothly, “since it seems you don’t hear that word often, but allow me to explain.
Now lets get to the romantic build upFrost always writes these amazing, realistic, in-depth characters so basically I fell in love with Spade and Dennis within the first five chaptersNeither is perfect and they have both lost people and it just made them even fucking better.
And Spade patient but possessive.
This is the first "off-shoot" book of Jeaniene Frost's Night Huntress series and it features Spade and Denise, two characters introduced in earlier books of the series.I've been a Spade fangirl since the moment of his introduction in the first book of the series, Halfway to the Grave.
It was a heartwrenching event and it's been given it's due respect in this book, which is important.I love that Denise doesn't come to see all Randy's flaws the way a lot of stories handle the new HEA.
They're very good together.I wasn't sure I was going to like Denise, but I did.
Her insecurities and decisions proved to me that she doesn’t come close to what Cat has to offer.
I do have to say that her final decision at the end to change plans on Spade, Cat, Bones and Ian and go off on her own to face Raum while the others were still fighting the battle was a huge letdown when it came to her decisioning.
But overall, if it wasn’t for Spade carrying this book with his signature lines, bold moves and intense emotions, it would have fallen completely flat.Overall, I was entertained, and I enjoyed the extra Spade scenes this book had to offer, but Night Huntress will continue to be my preferred storyline.
**4 "I'm glad I read this despite the most horrible cover ever", stars** A spinoff from the Night Huntress series, this is the story of Denise, Cat’s friend, and Spade, Bones’ friend.
When Denise watches her cousin murdered right in front of her by a supernatural being, she tries to get in contact with her friends Cat and Bones for help, but they are unreachable taking time off in New Zealand.
Instead, Bones’ old vampire friend Spade decides to look into Denise’s dilemma, but isn’t quick enough when the demon comes back and brands Denise with marks and infusing her with his essence.
First Drop of Crimson is the first spin-off novel set in Jeanine Frost’s popular Night Huntress universe.
It's a standalone that focuses on Denise and Spade, who are two reoccurring side characters from the main series.
With Spade’s help, Denise has to track down her errant relative, who is hidden in the vampire community, before the demon runs out of patience.It’s been a couple of years since I read a book set in the Night Huntress world.
While I adored the early books in the main series and loved Eternal Kiss of Darkness, I can’t say that I felt as strongly about First Drop of Crimson.
אז כן, התרגום לא משעשע כמו המקור אבל עדין מספיק טוב כדי להעביר את העלילה.הספר עוסק בדמויות הנלוות לציידת הלילה קאט ובעלה הערפד, בונז.
הדמויות הנלוות לפעמים יותר מרתקות ולדוגמא הספרים על וולאד, הידוע בשמו דרקולה, היו מצויינים וטובים יותר מאלה של ציידת הלילה.
הספר הזה עוסק בספייד חברו של בונז ובדניס חברתה של קאט.
אני מדמיינת לעצמי את ספייד כאליל הבנות עם העור השנהבי שלו והשיער הגולש והגוף המפוסל.באנגלית הקטע עם איאן במרתף, כשדניס חושבת שזה ספייד מאחורי הדלת, קורע מצחוק.
גם הקטע עם החתולה היה קורע.
משום מה בעברית הוא היה עגום ומצער את הלב.סהכ מאוד אהבתי את הספרים של ג'אנין פרוסט.
With Cat and Bones on the other side of the world, Denise's only help comes from Spade, master vampire.
Spade refuses to fall in love with a human again and Denise wants nothing to do with the world of vampires.
Stubborn creatures, but you gotta love them.I absolutely loved this book, a must read.
Spade and Denise are magic, their chemistry jumps off the page.
Jeaniene Frost is a master at pulling you into a story from page one, and that's exactly what you get with this book.
I love that Spade got his own book.
I believe we all saw the more calloused and hardened side of him in Night Huntress books because he is so fiercely loyal to Bones.Nonetheless, he was amazing in this book and we got to see the slow transformation of him falling in love which was completely adorable.To add to that, Denise went through a complete character change herself which was carried out beautifully by the author as usual.
It was great to see her become a more hardened yet loving character.Overall the book had great plot, chemistry and characters.
Jeaniene keeps it good and classy as always!

4 1/2 Stars!!First we had Cat and Bones, now we have Denise and Spade!!!
I love this world Jeaniene Frost has created.
FIRST DROP OF CRIMSON is set in the same world as the NIGHT HUNTRESS series but the main characters are Spade, Bones' best friend and Denise, Cat's best friend.
I've been intrigued by Spade from the beginning of the NIGHT HUNTRESS series and he did not disappoint in his own story.
Both Spade and Denise have valid reasons for resisting their attraction to the other and it was an action packed, sometimes a little emotional joy ride reading their journey to their HEA.
First off let me say this, I have only read a little over half of the first Night Huntress Novel, so I really know nothing about Cat and Bones.
This book has just about all the elements for a good PNR, it has lots blood fighting action, adventure, some humor, traveling, family, friends and throw in hot sex with a vampire, you have a great PNR book.
So, she thinks it a vampire and tries to call Cat and Bones for help with no avail she calls Spide.
Even though Spade wasn’t exactly my favourite vampire of the Night Huntress world, he’s still damn sexy and this book proves it!
But, surprisingly, I thought Denise had some real presence in this book.
Despite her panic attacks and PTSD, she still kept up with Spade and really made for a great heroine.
Spade and Denise had great chemistry.
I thought that was the sweetest part in the entire book!
Frost really knows how to make me wish I were the heroines of her books.Frost also introduces demons in this novel and I loved this new species that she has incorporated.
Reread feb 2014Denise was a little hard for me to warm up to at first, and Spade?
Well, I would like two of him please :) **wink, wink**.
However with respect for Denise after the first couple of chapters I really became invested in these two, and I found my heart aching for Denise.
After losing her husband and witnessing such gruesome events I decided that she is one tough cookie and I would definitley want her on my team.
The love story between Denise and Spade was just naughty enough to make me blush.
First Drop of Crimson is excellent, get it, read it, love it!
For some reason I expected Spade's book to be hotter.It was okay, I didn't mind it. What I usually love about these books is how over the top they are. The villains are super-villainy, the good guys are filthy rich, the sex is MINDBLOWING in a YOUNEVERKNEWWHATORGASMSWEREBEFORETHIS kind of way. But I guess I just didn't feel the love for this one. Oh well, onto the next!
Not bad. I didn't like Denise as much as Cat but Spade is yummy.
She has sworn off all things undead and paranormal after his death, so when a demon comes to Denise demanding she help him find a long-lost relative of hers who may be with the vampires, Denise is not too thrilled and just a bit apprehensive.
Of course, the greatest danger both Spade and Denise have to worry about is not just the loss of life in both their lives, but the loss of their hearts to one another.For all you Cat and Bones fans, I don't think you will be disappointed in this book at all.
