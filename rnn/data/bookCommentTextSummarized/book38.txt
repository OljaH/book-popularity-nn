Just wrote a review on Les Faux-monnayeurs that briefly shows my thoughts on Gide and this novel, so I won't say much on the journals other than the fact that it was definitely interesting to see exactly what the author was thinking when he was deciding how to write his book. It could have felt like entering forbidden territory but it didn't, as Gide's voice is very similar to that of the narrator and of Edouard, so the journal felt more or less like a fitting piece in the puzzle.
C'est dans ce journal que Gide évoque l'écriture des "Faux-monnayeurs", roman où le personnage d'Édouard écrit un roman intitulé "Les Faux-monnayeurs", tout en tenant parallèlement un "Journal des Faux-monnayeurs." On y apprend plus que rien et moins que l'on ne voudrait.
pour les cours
Prmeière lecture (dans le cadre du programme de la classe de littérature de terminale littéraire), je suis déçu. Je m'attendais à un making-off des Faux-Monnayeurs, mais ai plus eu l'impression de lire les remarques de l'auteur sur sa cadence d'écriture...
(J'ai lu ce livre pour les cours)C'est un livre simple et rapide à lire, mais je ne le trouve pas très utile...
I loved this.
I think it is important and good to see the creative process and the struggle that most often comes with trying to make a good piece and as someone who -attempts to- write-s it's also very comforting.I think it is true for me also that I begin with a certain idea and when I'm finished, even if I may get to the point I wanted to reach, my character's have generally taken me on a very different road than that that I expected.
This is for anyone who likes to think about how books are written.
Interesting and well written, it's a bit confusing though as Les Faux-monnayeurs is often completely different from what's described here.
2,5/5
