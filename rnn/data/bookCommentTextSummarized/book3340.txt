This book was not only fabulous, it had lots of Bible references it in! I was surprised (happily) of course, especially since some of her other books do swear, but I guess maybe that was to make it realistic. I don't know, but this book was fantastic, and I suggest this to pretty much anyone!
This was one of the first Emilie Loring books I read, and I enjoyed it..I liked the lead characters and thought the story was pretty good..I like the little child in this one, too, she was adorable! The story had a bit of peril, which I usually don't like, but overall this was a good read..
Stolen from my dad's collection of ancient paperbacks. I enjoyed it as it hearkens back to another time. The hero even carried the heroin over a brook so she wouldn't have to get wet.
Another nice romantic Emilie Loring book.
One of my favorites authors. Fun story; easy engaging read.
I started reading Emile Loring books when I picked up a paperback from a rack in a hotel lobby (for 50 cents) while on my sister's & my yearly vacation to visit my father. Hooked! I went on to purchase and read every Emilie Loring romance written and available in paperback, not knowing that she had died before I was even born. I loved these books, but read them when I was between about 12 and 18 years old. I was a young reader - do keep that in mind! :-)
Boo hoo, this was my least favorite book of a favorite author, one that I read when I want to escape. But I don't think I'm likely to read this again. I was disappointed in the inconsistencies of the character, and stupidity of the incommunications. It was worse than usual. Sorry, but it is what it is.
