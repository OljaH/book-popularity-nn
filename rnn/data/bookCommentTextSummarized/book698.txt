Still a very practical book; albeit one which has now acquired an historical fascination.
Baden-Powell’s character shines through.
For example he reminisces over a popular old soldier in his regiment who could knit (stockings [long socks]); the result of which was that he was in great demand by everyone else!
Baden-Powell’s obsession with health and exercise seems OTT until one remembers that there were no antibiotics, no National Health Service, and that many children died in infancy, or grew-up weak.
How many 7 to 10 year olds could do that nowadays?!
