Певец революции на самом деле был певцом культуры и просвещения, что актуально как никогда
Maxim Gorky was a socialist and celebrated author.
Gorky's 1917-1918 newspaper during the Russian revolution was suppressed by the Bolsheviks for the sharp things he had to say about their actions, including this passage written just days after Lenin's October coup d'etat:"Lenin, Trotsky, and their companions have already become poisoned with the filthy venom of power, and this is evidenced by their shameful attitude toward freedom of speech, the individual, and...
those rights for the triumph of which democracy struggled."on the other hand Gorky was clearly an intellectual, more of an artist than a revolutionary himself.
Some boring stuff and some interesting stuff. Notable would be going out of his way to criticize anti-Semites of the time and his ideas regarding the need for cultural change before political change.
