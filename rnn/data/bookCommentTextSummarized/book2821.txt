(view spoiler)[Bettie's BooksThe shelving, status updates and star rating constitute how I felt about this book. (hide spoiler)]
I found out afterwards what it actually was from a flat mate from Orkney who must have seen them regularly and thought I had flipped (a Haar forms when a parcel of warm air passes over the cold North Sea. The warm air at the bottom of the parcel is cooled by the cold air below, until it can no longer 'hold' the moisture that was previously contained within.
The effect of his conscious thought of their timelessness was quite pertinent to the characters in the story at this time, as if they are only passing through as others have before them.
Book 2 of 'A Scots Quair'.Lewis Grassic Gibbon is a beautiful, lyrical writer, obviously at one with Scotland and its fabulous beauty.
It's evident in every line and page of this book as it follows the story of Chris Guthrie and her son Ewan after WWI.
Now married to a minister and living at Segget, the story follows the ups and downs of village life.
I particularly loved the last third of the book where we heard more of Chris's thoughts.
She is the backbone of this story, along with Scotland itself and the quirks of her people.
Cloud Howe picks up where the most excellent Sunset Song left off with Chris Guthrie moving on with her life in post WWI Scotland.
Cloud Howe spends most of its time in the early 1920s and spends significant time with our heroine Chris Guthrie, but increases the amount of ink devoted to her husband and her son Ewan.
And like Sunset Song, Gibbon takes his time to give us some colorful backstory on many of the characters in the early parts of the book.
What really struck me in Cloud Howe was that Chris and her son Ewan are non-believers and they don’t hide it and are not quiet about it.

This is the second book of the trilogy A Scots Quair.The plot continues with the saga of Chris Guthrie and his son Ewan. However, her tragical life seems to have no end.The setting takes place in Segget, where the author is buried in the SW corner of the churchyard.The sequel of this book is Grey Granite.
i didn't enjoy this one as much as Sunset Song... for a number of reasons - found it was less about protagonist Chris and more about the socialism and other people in the village... which wasn't always that interesting. I had every intention of reading the 3rd book but wasn't that inspired by this one. also thought the ending was overly dramatic.
I finally gave up, halfway through. The first installment, Sunset Song, is brilliant and a classic in the Scottish canon. However Gibbon wrote a series of three, and Cloud Howe is #2. While I recognize it is well written and a solid historical record, as well as an important story about a strong woman in times when it was mostly a man's world, it does not capture my attention. I've given up.
Not as good as  Sunset Song, though it was interesting to see how the story continued.
This is my second Lewis Grassic Gibbon and I loved it! It took me a while to get into Sunset Song but I instantly 'got' this one. Fabulous lilting language - like poetry - and so evocative of life in Scotland years ago. I can now see why his trilogy is a classic. And I'm now into the third one.
Excellently written book. Beautiful language and descriptions
A Scots Quair #2: Chris enters into a new life in a new town with a new husband, but things go wrong. Hilariously uses the town gossips as a Greek chorus in this collection of stories of the town. Wonderful lyrical writing.
This one is a solid contribution to the Scots Quair trilogy, though a bit of a swerve from the pastoral dimensions of Sunset Song and not yet given over to the gothic dimensions of Grey Granite. Worth reading, especially as a preface to Grey Granite, and for a keen view of small town Scottish life in the early 20thC.
Read this at school and was every bit as good as I remembered. A lot of Gibbon's comments on society are still very relevant today.
I think I related to this one more than Sunset Song, although the story is less compelling. In many ways it repeats the first novel. Robert saves the novel, though.
