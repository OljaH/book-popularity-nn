You know, that sort of thing that only intellectuals read and pretend to understand and enjoy.
But when I start to read them...The first chapter is mysterious and deliberately obtuse.
The reader is picked up in the middle of some strange goings-on and must try to decipher the characters and the allusive plotline.But keep reading.
No matter how much you feel like you're drowning, or lost in some maze, or hurtling down the hill aquiring more and more mass like that mythical snowball from your youth, just keep on reading.
Worth reading either to better understand both black and white culture, or to simply be carried off into another world by some astounding prose.
This is of course is the usual thing with literary works, but the stakes are higher when heaven is a prophet and hell is a profiteer.An emphasis on hunting coupled with a fairy tale story of white supremacy made for an uncomfortable taste in the wake of Ferguson and government-hired guns killing a black person every 28 hours, an off the top of the head statistic that doesn't have ready recourse to the numbers of murdered brown and indigenous people but knows the less popularized are comparable.
Isaac Ike McCaslin è un eroe della conoscenza, in questo romanzo familiare epico, ramificato in frammenti biblici come un fiume sacro e profondo, nella narrazione di una dinastia segnata dalla miscegenation e dalla maledizione del sangue: è tra le pieghe della sopportazione e nelle diverse forme della tolleranza che prende corpo la voce del Deep South, la tradizione dell'oralità che incatena storie ed episodi uno dentro l'altra, in un groviglio anticonvenzionale dove la trama si disegna a rovescio.

“The Bear” is one of my favorite short stories and the only thing I knew going in to Go Down, Moses was that it would be here surrounded by six more to make a loose kind of novel.
So it’s not exactly six more stories filling in around one of my favorites, it’s “The Bear” being the heart and soul and key and consummation of all the rest.It isn’t perfect but I’d like it less if it was.
کتاب باب میل من نبود ، فاکنر نویسنده دلخواه من نیست حتی ذره ای از کتابهاش لذت نمیبرم این سومین اثر بود بعد از گور به گور و خشم و هیاهو ، که باز هم جذبش نشدم جایزه نوبل نوش جانش اما واقعا اگر قصدش نشون دادن تبعیض نژادی تو کارهاش بود آنچنان ملموس این و به خواننده نشون نداده یا مشکل از ترجمه است یا خود اثر فیلم های که تو این زمینه دیدم برای نشون دادن اون فضا خیلی قوی و مفیدتر از این سه تا کتاب بوده بهرحال فاکنر جان شرمنده 😉
Faulkner’s descriptions and his ability to heighten and maintain tension are masterful and unforgettable.The final portion of this novella explores, through the thoughts of primary characters, the whole anguished history of the culture and racial dynamics of the South from pre-Civil Wars times through Reconstruction and the early 20th century, the travail caused by a society and culture both romantic and elemental attempting to deal with whites, blacks, and Indians and every combination of the three.
در کل اصلااا فاکنرو دوست ندارم انگار یه ادم بیکار نشسته به نوشتن یه عالمه کاغذ داره و وقتذهنشو رها کرده مینویسه و مینویسه براش هم هیچی مهم نیست اصلا و ابدا اهمیت نداره خواننده سرشته متن و داستان رو گم کنه فقط نوشتن براش اهمیت داشته خواسته ذهن شلوغش رو خالی کنه یک جاهایی از کتاب واقعن توصیف های بیربطی بود که من نمیدونم بقیه چطور تحملش کردن ولی من رو حسابی عصبانی کرد مثلا بین مکالمه ی دونفر یهو شروع کرد به توصیف تفنگ و فشنگها که فلان و فلان و فلان و ....
ci riesce perfettamente, creando quello “Zio Ike”, personaggio centrale del racconto centrale del libro: “L’Orso”, quello che ne prende più della metà delle pagine, quello che ricostruisce la storia della famiglia a partire dal capostipite che aveva mischiato il suo sangue bianco con quello dei suoi schiavi negri anche attraverso l’incesto dando origine ai due rami distinti della stirpe, quello bianco (di cui Ike fa parte) e quello nero che Ike riconosce parimenti suo, fino ad abdicare nel possesso della terra, della casa, degli averi, a rinunciare alla moglie e con essa alla possibilità di generare un figlio, bianco o nero che sia.
[anobii, Dec, 2014] Let My People Go Stati Uniti d’America, Anno del Signore 1940. Faulkner dedica il libro alla sua mammy nera: “a mammy Caroline Barr, Mississippi (1840 – 1940); che è nata in schiavitù e ha dato alla mia famiglia una fedeltà senza riserve né calcolo e alla mia infanzia una devozione e un amore incommensurabili”. Una dedica/manifesto di … Black Faulkner.Le vicende dei discendenti, Bianchi e Neri, legittimi e illegittimi, del capostipite Lucius Quintus Carothers McCaslin, dai pr
È un magnifico film … bianco e nero, anni ’50, quello che Faulkner ti mette sotto il naso.
E lo strumento usato dal Nero è proprio la Bibbia, il Libro per elezione degli antichi padroni del popolo nero americano.Questo, a proposito della condizione dei neri americani, quanto scriveva Walter White, Segretario della NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) a Sturges, regista di Sullivan's Travels (1941): “I want to congratulate and thank you for the church sequence in Sullivan's Travels.
For the most part, I liked this book. This is a collection of seven interrelated "short" stories. All the stories have themes about race and wilderness. They are all set in his fictitious Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. My favorite story was called "The Bear" and it probably the most famous one in this book. My only complaint about this collection is some of the stories seemed more like novella than short stories. However, I liked the wilderness aspect of the book that makes it a great summer/autumn read.
Among the most beautiful of Faulkner is the Faulkner that studies the relationships that mankind forges amongst itself and with the outside world.
The mosts famous section of this book, "The Bear," is just a wonder for how well it does what Faulkner messes up in works like Intruder in the Dust.
Coming of age, the politics between races, the inevitability of time--this one section alone smacks out your teeth with the aging of a boy into manhood (and all the pains therein) in his quest to fell a mythically sized bear.
But how the South can maintain its flat stereotype with Faulkner's work in print is beyond me.
In love with Faulkner (4.5)—I didn't get him.
When I read his As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, and Absalom!
I liked Light in August, but I couldn't appreciate his style.
Then I came back, and it happened to be in the right season, when my preoccupation was not storytelling but style and sentence rhythm.
It has to do with my progress as a writer as I'm able to appreciate fiction for other than their plot.I relished, no reveled in, Faulkner's meandering sentences.
After reading this excellent collection of interrelated stories, I'm tempted to go back and reread his classics, especially Absalom!
Now, I have found that the images in the book pop up all the time in my life, and resonate with profound meaning for me.
Once, driving through Florida, I saw a series of huge houses, all set back behind at least an acre of field, all in poor repair, with dark windows and no signs of life, but the grass had been cut, the windows were un-boarded, so someone had to be there!
I have tried to describe the feeling those houses gave me to many people, but the ones who really understood were those who had also read this book.
از کتابهای خوبی بود که سالهای قبل خواندم.

Uno splendido viaggio nell'anima nera dell'America del Sud. Dove "nero" si riferisce a un colore di pelle ma anche a una zona dell'anima.
آقای فاکنر عزیز نه شخصیت ها را دوست داشتم نه داستانهایتان را.
Especially poignant now, "Moses" is a raggedy collection of connected, nested stories centered on a family lineage that mixes both white and black, free and slave (or ex-slave) and ultimately highlights the futility of them all against an unwavering wildness that can only be dealt with by destroying it.With the exception of Ike's sanction against the folly of thinking that one can possess anything that doesn't want to be possessed (whether land, the feral, or in love), this is a far more accessible work than, say, "The Sound and the Fury".
برخیز ای موسی سومین کتابی است که از فاکنر خواندم و اگر اغراق نکرده باشم، از همان موقع شروع کتاب بیش از دو کتاب قبلی دوستش داشتم.
فهمیدم که کتاب مجموعه داستان های کوتاهی بوده که فاکنر بعد از تصمیم به گردآوری آنها در کنار هم، اندک تغییراتی داده و آن را به صورت رمان درآورده است.
از این رو، هر بخش کتاب را در قالب داستانی کوتاه دوست داشتم هر چند که به جز دلقک دغدار تمام بخش های دیگر به هم مربوط بودند و شخصیتهای مشترکی، حداقل از یک دودمان، ماجرا را نقل میکردند.
فهمیدم که کتاب مجموعه داستان های کوتاهی بوده که فاکنر بعد از تصمیم به گردآوری آنها در کنار هم، اندک تغییراتی داده و آن را به صورت رمان درآورده است.
با پیش‌زمینه‌ای که از سبک جریان سیال ذهن فاکنر در کتاب‌های قبلی داشتم، برخیز ای موسی را به لحاظ روایتی خطی از یک دودمان ساده‌تر یافتم اما پر بیراه نگفته‌ام اگر بگویم پیچیدگی روابط و شخصیت‌ها گاه چنان مثل کلاف سردرگمی من خواننده را غرق خود میکرد که با خود می‌گفتم حل معمای یک رمان جنایی به مراتب ساده تر از کشف این روابط و به خاطر سپردن آنهاست.
خود داستان فریادی است از ناعدالتی‌هایی که در حق سیاهان شده و این جماعت مظلوم ساده را به صمیمانه‌ترین و بی‌پیرایه‌ترین شکل به نمایش می‌گذارد.
As usual, a journey into the Mississippi of William Faulkner is not recommended for someone looking for a light read in the dentist office.
However, if you like books which challenge you - not only with subject matter, but also through their mechanics - then Faulkner proves superb.
Go Down Moses was always presented to me as a collection of short stories.
Go Down Moses is a collection of short stories in the same way that Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried is a collection.
Some subtle happening or remark might have great meaning (and I'm sure I missed a lot of these); different parts of the book amplify other parts, both forward and backwards - in that sense the story sort of seeps into you from all directions.
I loved not just the tales and the meaning in them but the experience of reading it all.Somehow I've managed to miss Faulkner (well, I know how - I've managed to miss most classic literature) so far be it from me to say much other than a bit about my enjoyment of this book.
I find it difficult to review this novel, so I will leave that to others more proficient at doing so. Some adjectives just off the top of my head: powerful, amazing, unbearably sad, jubilantly comic. All these things in one short novel is incredible enough, but Faulkner manages all these things sometimes in one (long) sentence. Relationships and kinships between the black and white races, man vs. nature, old vs. young, are some recurring themes that are part of the magic that binds you to this world and time.
Probably my favorite Faulkner novel. First time I ever read Faulkner where I wasn't forced to as part of an English class, and I was finally able to enjoy it. Suddenly I realized that Faulkner was, in fact, hilarious, and I was having a great time reading the book. Then I got to "The Bear", and it blew me away, and I understood why Faulkner is often regarded as America's greatest writer. I recommend this to anyone who has ever been curious about Faulkner.
It's Faulkner. Good writing. Good stories: of blood lines, blood relatives, blood pulsing, blood spilling, blood spurting. Mostly about family back home.
Faulkner pairs the painful history of black tenant farmer Lucas Beauchamp and of farm owner and white cousin Roth Edmonds with a comical present-day story that has Lucas and McCaslin sparring, each exasperated by how fate has inextricably bound them.
Gavin Stevens is the white angel that's keeps Samuel's grisly end out of the papers and helps co-ordinate and produce the final dignified black ending for Mollie's grandson.
Stevens remembers the event that led Samuel into criminality -- theft from the commissary of Roth Edmonds -- and he's smart enough to comprehend Mollie's meaning when she says 'Edmonds sold him (Samuel) to the Pharaoh', a reference to the lyrics of the old negro spiritual 'Go Down Moses'.
For a collection of short stories, this order would work just as well as any other; if we see them as a whole, though, as a novel, the order is crucial, because it serves the thematic idea of the whole work.The first story is Was, which introduces the main character, Isaac McCaslin - the only surviving legitimate, male-descended heir of the McCaslin clan - in the first sentence, even though the story is about events that took place before he was born (as the title indicates).
In each of these tales, Faulkner indicts racist reductionism, as Toni Morrison once remarked, by "[taking] black people seriously."In the book's longest chapter, the classic freestanding novella "The Bear," a young Isaac McCaslin, the closest thing the novel has to a hero, pores over the family ledgers in the farm's commissary assembling through his forebears' often sparse notations the appalling family history ("His own daughter His own daughter.
