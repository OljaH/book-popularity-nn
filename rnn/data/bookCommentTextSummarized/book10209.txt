For starters, this is not a book for reading only; instead, it is a companion to regular contemplative practice (albeit not necessarily one that is "Buddhist").I was "forced" to read this book as a graduate student at The Naropa Institute (in the same way that all students are "forced" to read textbooks) and found that I got very little out of the book.
Trungpa definitely takes the "romance" out of spiritual practice and reveals it to be as mundane as going to work, eating dinner, or taking a bath.
I suppose this book was planted one of the first seeds in my heart that I had run out of religions I could trust.
The prospect was once a bit discouraging but it's okay now.
The title says it all, a "Myth of Freedom".
I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it because you already know who you are.
Once again it's a great day to lose your mind but you don't need a myth or a method to (not) do it.
Perhaps the view that nihilism=god and emptiness=love is the myth of meditation.
This book is freaking ridiculous. After reading this book I knew immediately where Pema Chodron got her wisdom and brilliance from. I loved this book because it is some of the same insights that Chodron shares, but it is from a harsher tongue, whereas Chodron is more kind. I really loved this book. I lent it out immediately after finishing it because I think it is so worthwhile.
"...one level of meditation is where we observe our thoughts... the next level is where we realize the observer does not exist!"Really makes ya' think. Don't it?
This is what is called the Sword of Manjushri, which cuts the root of dualistic conceptualization with one blow....The real objective is just to squash the frivolousness, the unwillingness to see things as they actually are, which appears rational."And an interesting observation about Zen practice among Americans by this Tibetan Buddhist: -"To the Japanese, Zen practice is an ordinary Japanese life-situation in which you just do your daily work and sit a lot of zazen.
The tradition is trying to bring out boredom, which is a necessary aspect of the narrow path of discipline, but instead the practice turns out to be an archeological, sociological survey of interesting things to do, something you could tell your friends about...
wowzers. some of this i really relate to and some is beyond where i am at and read and re-read as i get more meditation under my belt, would love to read this with a group or teacher. his razor sharp wisdom and truthfulness is inspiring and scary sometimes. i love all Chogyam Trungpa's writing because it has that quality of transmission into direct experience through the awareness and presence with which it was written.
A companion piece to Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, The Myth of Freedom and The Way of Meditation widens, deepens and expands on information regarding Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. As always, Trungpa Rinpoche's style is patient, clear and concise. Never a bad read, no matter which book you pick up. Great stuff!
Basis of Buddhist 'crazy thought' meditation. Interesting, although the author has some very dubious flaws of his own. I'm not going to totally dismiss it, though.
Read for class - not my thing?
it's a doozie...read it yourself.
It is this energy which is the centerless dance of phenomena, the universe interpenetrating and making love to itself.
So we reach the heart of the situation and, if this is a meeting of two people, the relationship is very inspiring because we do not see the other person purely in terms of physical attraction or habitual patterns, we see the inside as well as the outside.This whole-way-through communication might produce a problem.
If that person runs away from you, that is his way of communicating with you.
Changed my life.
Meditation should not be regarded as a vacation from irritation.""Meditation practice is not a matter of trying to produce a hypnotic state of mind or create a sense of restfulness.
Trying to achieve a restful state of mind reflects a mentality of poverty.
Instead, meditation should reflect a mentality of richness in the sense of using everything that occurs in the state of mind.""Having experienced the precision of mindfulness, we might ask the question of ourselves, 'What should I do with that?
Awareness says leave the flower in the jungle, since it is the natural place for that plant to grow.""The lion's roar is fearlessness in the sense the ever situation in life is workable.
Meditation is part of the practice needed, but this book went much deeper.
And if we can begin to open without always having to protect ourselves, then perhaps we can begin to really help others." (116)"Samyak means seeing life as it is without crutches, straightforwardly.
In a bar one says, "I would like a straight drink." Not diluted with club soda or water; you just have it straight.
No dilutions, no concoctions - just a straight drink.
Life is a straight drink - hot pleasure, hot pain, straightforward, one hundred percent." (120)"People who reject the materialism of American society and set themselves apart from it are unwilling to face themselves.
This collection of talks is a staple for any Shambhalian and is one of Chogyam Trungpa's most famous books.
For those familiar with Pema Chodron, you can tell where she gets her wisdom.
She herself has said she has read this book over 25 times or so.
Upon finishing it for the first of what will probably be many, many times, I can see why.
After finishing reading a few pages you have to contemplate.
You have to go back and re-read.
This is a "collection of teachings" - not just a book.
However, it is not as accessible as Pema Chodron's writing.
And what I said was that perhaps the audience might be bored with what we have to present, but we must raise the intelligence, the standards of the audience, up to the level of what we are presenting, rather than trying to constantly match their expectations, their desire for entertainment.
Once you begin to try to satisfy the audience's desire for entertainment, you constantly bend down and bend down and bend down, until the whole thing becomes absurd.
The film might raise the audience's level of sophistication.”
I purchased this book while perusing a Borders that was going out of business, and strictly because of the title.
I fully expected this book to reaffirm that thinking, and to discuss how to overcome it.
The book met and surpassed this expectation.Some books create a peace in me by just catching a glimpse of them.
From the time of my purchase it served as a meditation bell.
It reminded me of how important it is to be meditative in every aspect of my life, not just in sitting.
I always want to temper my "rating" of spiritual books with the concept that different things and ways of putting things speak to some people in helpful ways and to others in not as helpful ways.
While I find the writings of Bhante Henepola Gunaratana extremely helpful, other Buddhist writers, such as Chogyam Trungpa, are less helpful to me.
I am simply a non-Buddhist who finds the philosophy and psychology helpful in living my life.
That said, I have much underlined in the book that I found useful, but there was also much that I found simply obtuse.
I read Rinpoche's Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism a few years ago when I first became interested in the Dharma.
It was way over my head (and still is) but I was struck by its clarity and Trungpa's straightforward presentation of the path.
After accumulating a tiny bit of knowledge about Buddhism, I see that this book is a brilliant synopsis of the entire path to enlightenment, from cultivating an understanding of why Samsara and Nirvana are not what we're really looking for, all the way to the ultimate state of true freedom.
If you like Trungpa Rinpoche's style even a little bit, please read this important book.
That book was set up as transcriptions of his talks, including the Q & A sections, which sometimes veered off the topic a bit.
This book has been edited in a way that is a little clearer to me.
While probably also drawn from his talks, each short "chapter" has been edited so that you have more focus on a smaller topic.
Instead of getting lost in the morass of the eightfold path of the Boddhissatva, this book separates each part of the path.
This is not a book on how to meditate, but it IS about the attitudes, presumptions, and instincts that can get in the way of meditation.
I liked this book and would have given it 3.5 stars if Goodreads had half stars.
With subsequent readings, I'm sure I would have a better understanding of what Trungpa is saying here, but I just found the first read a little difficult to follow at times, especially in comparison to his son's book "Turning the Mind into an Ally." I kept waiting for Trungpa to translate all of the text into a more straightforward description, but it never really came.
That said, I do think this book has great value for anyone interested in Buddhism and meditation.
It's just not a great starting point.
This is among the most challenging books I have read. It induces a great deal of insecurity; it forced me to look at my own habits and mind-sets with more awareness and detachment. It really kicked me hard, and over time I have come to appreciate that.Trungpa spins an elaborate web of observations about the human condition, and then he presents meditation, as an insulting, boring, and meaningless activity: the only way out of ignorance. Don't meditate because you want to grow as a person; meditate because it's the only honest approach to existence.
There were things I didn't understand in this book, which is okay...probably partially the point. I always feel adrift a bit when I'm reading Buddhist teachings. Alternately, I feel a home in them and then just as easily, I feel like the biggest fool who doesn't understand anything. Overall, though, this book was helpful and moving. It made me realize how much I'd like to talk about these teachings with other people to help me integrate my understanding.
After years of reading other Buddhist books, I was able to understand that this book too repeats the same Buddhist philosophy aligned with Chodron and Hann. I don't think he is saying freedom is a myth in a negative nihilistic way but actually, that our notion of freedom itself is clouded and unrefined. Highly recommended.Previously... been trying to read this book for two years now and just can't go on... I read it and nothing stays in my head so I give up. Maybe some day...
I'm hitting Buddhist book fatigue, I think, as I didn't get a whole lot out of most of this one. There was a lot about working with emotions and with people that was very insightful, but there was an equal amount of stuff about more obscure Tibetan/Sanskrit stuff that made my brain get mushy. Gotta take a break and read some other stuff!
this book falls into the category of books that concern how to live a full life on this planet in these times. the wisdom and insight contained has been passed down through many generations.it will give your silly, preoccupied-with-itself ego a big smack in the face.and that is something that all egos need.
this book is surprisingly easy to read. trungpa uses lots of buddhist terms and ideas, but describes them in very accessible ways. my favorite sections are on boredom, anger, and patience. this is definitely not a light read, but it is very rewarding. trungpa makes alot of very insightful observations in this book, but he doesn't seem preachy or arrogant.
After reading this I couldn't've hated that womanizing jerk more.Turns out he was right about me, shook me out of a spot that, five years on, I'm still confused about.It really is a great and important book, but no one should read it.So two stars is all you get Chogyam.Two stars and death. no more women.no more drink.bastard.
This book is brilliant. I need to read it again as almost every sentence is impeccable and has the potential for great impact. I love the warrior of words approach of the writing style. Very clear and precise.
Only easterner I have ever read who took the time to really understand the mind of the western mental operating system.Who also shows us how to zap our hard drive, after identifying our bugged programming.See you for you, and how to kill it.Keep the body.Know truth.BE>
