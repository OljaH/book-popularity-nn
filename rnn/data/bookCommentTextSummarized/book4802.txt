Slipping and sliding in the muddle of Leslie Jamison's chapter, from The Empathy Exams, on Morgellons Syndrome, I came over here to remind myself of what Whitehead says about perspective. A slice of banana after too much spice. For Whitehead, I have nothing but reverence.
That book was recommended to me as the best introduction to the thought of the best British thinker of all times. Since I don’t know more yet about Whitehead, I suppose that I am now really well introduced and, for sure, his originality, careless profundity and humor make me want to go further…
My undergraduate degree in philosophy focused on Whitehead. This was prior to my own conversion. While I now am quite critical of Whitehead, I acknowledge him as an import modern thinker.
