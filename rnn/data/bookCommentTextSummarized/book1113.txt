This is a collection of really wonderful poems that Walter de la Mare (the famous poet and writer in his own right) collected and presents in thematic groupings/headings.
Frankly, although the poems themselves are enchanting and wonderful (I love poetry, so I'm biased) and by multiple famous poets, I found the introduction that de la Mare wrote (about how he came to include the poems he did) as intriguing and magical as the poems themselves.
One of the most fascinating books I've ever read.
It isn't a story book, though the story in it is deeply powerful.
It isn't a book of favourite poems, though the favourite poems are there and a remarkably eclectic lot they are, too.
It isn't a book of footnotes, because they are not at the feet: very often they take up pages and pages.
You will never regret it.Oh, and the date I finished reading it?
I will never finish reading it.
It's a perfect book for a desert island.
A collection of poetry for kiddos, from Chaucer on up. It's a nice collection, and pretty extensive.
Here’s a sample:“Hay, nou the day dauis;The jolie Cok crauis;Nou shroudis the shauis,Throu Natur anone….”Some relate stories that are outside my experiences:“When my mother died I was very young,And my father sold me while yet my tongueCould scarcely cry, ‘weep!
‘weep!
‘weep!So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.”Some are in dialect:“There were twa brethren in the north,They went to the school thegither;The one unto the other said,‘Will you try a warsle afore?’Some are familiar with additional verses, including BINGO.
An excellent read of little known poems such as the Wee Wee Man plus annotations.My only criticism is that the notes are the back of the book/s (in paperbook it is two books, confusing enough) which makes it hard to read.
I quite liked de la Mare's introduction. It set a good tone for the book.
