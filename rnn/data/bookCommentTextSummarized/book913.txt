Însă Rebreanu, prin "Ion", reuşeşte să atingă un subiect sensibil: lupta pentru emancipare a românilor din Transilvania (subiect atât de controversat, de altfel...), strigând parcă, cu un glas mut, către trecut, către politica interbelică maghiară (să nu uităm că romanul este interbelic, dar face referire la perioada antebelică), către maghiarii -acum ei răsculaţi!- din Ardealul interbelic...Pe mine unul, geopolitica surprinsă în roman m-a întărâtat la culme, iar eu sunt un adept al globalizării, în sensul în care, dacă s-ar putea, aş demola cu un buldozer frontierele şi aş elimina -cu greu!- conceptul de "rasă" atât de uşor înrădăcinat în concepţia comunitară.
M-a impresionat felul in care ne-a oferit posibilitatea de a anticipa destinul tragic al personajelor prin Iisus rastignit pe cruce, mancat si ruginit, drumul care era o metafora pentru viata zbuciumata a lui Ion si alte elemente prezentate in incipitul romanului.Ion...pur si simplu l-am dispretuit.
Nu o iubea deloc pe Ana, s-a jucat cu sentimentele ei, a fost insensibil, violent, cinic si, chiar daca ea era o sotia buna si o mama iubitoare, el o placea si mai putin decat inainte.
Ce reprezenta pentru mine "Ion" înainte de a o citi?Răspuns : o carte plictisitoare care e doar obligatorie pentru şcoală.Ce reprezintă pentru mine acum?Răspuns : una dintre carţile mele preferate ce m-a făcut să cred că literatura română e chiar foarte interesantă dacă ştii să încerci să o priveşti altfel decât se spune.
It revolves mostly around Ion and his desperate wish for more land, because in the society of that time, having land meant that you had some sort of higher standing in society, and for a poor boy with nothing, that was the most important thing in the world.
The second conflict of this book was between his wish for riches and his need for true love, because Ion is torn between two girls.
On the one hand, Anna has a lot of land and money, and marrying her would certainly raise his status in the village, but, on the other hand, Florica represents the girl he loves, his soul mate as some might call it.When I first read the summary, I though, wow this could be great.
Ion is the first objective novel in the Romanian literature. The author exceptionally ilustrates the conflict generated by the fight for land, in a world in which the status of people was established by the land posessions they had. The vulgarity of which some people might notice is actually the cruel reality of those times!
Despite the fact that theres indeed a low rate on this great novel no one can deny that this isnt the greatest masterpiece ever written by a Romanian, because it is. I would not write what is about, or the content of its story. The only thing I can say is this. The reason why theres a low rate on this great novel is because is part of a mandatory lesson in Romanian school. So therefore lots of romanian teenagers will cast their filthy anger on this great book and on our, posibily the greatest Ro
Despite the fact that there´s indeed a low rate on this great novel no one can deny that this isn´t the greatest masterpiece ever written by a Romanian, because it is.
The reason why there´s a low rate on this great novel is because is part of a mandatory lesson in Romanian school.
The same type of teens who critizices Romanian literature composed by great geniuses like Liviu Rebreanu,Lucian Blaga , Ionel Teodereanu, Camil Petrescu, Cezar Petrescu, Panait Istrati etc are the same type of humans who critizice the rest of Romanian culture and it´s values.
Excelenta carte, unul dintre cele mai bune romane romanesti.L-am recitit cu si mai multa placere multi ani dupa terminarea liceului.
O descriere extrem de realista si in acelasi timp foarte plastica a satului romanesc din Transilvania de la inceput de secol 20.
Un bun prilej de asemenea de a observa structura peisajului rural din acea epoca, cu anumite "clisee" ce persista si astazi (preotul corupt si meschin, tanarul nationalist inflacarat, etc), cu structura ei etnica ce s-a pierdut de atunci (maghiari, evrei, romani ...).Toate acestea redate prin capacitatea lui Rebreanu de a utiliza cuvinte simple care taie in carne vie.De citit si de recitit.
This was on of my worst nightmares during highschool and it remained one of my most hated books (not necessary because of how it is written, but mostly because of what the story is about). I think the events and people in the story are quite vulgar.
Un roman excepțional. Mă bucur că mi-am învins repulsia față de bibliografia școlară în vremea aia și i-am dat o șansă lui Rebreanu. E o capodoperă pe care ar trebui s-o citească cel puțin fiecare român, indiferent de vârstă.
Schema cu hai-sa-facem-bebe-ca-sa-ne-casatorim a fost folosita in exces de telenovele - desi in general fata era cea care profita - si la momentul asta majoritatea populatiei este probabil desensibilizata in fata acestui "motiv".Altfel, ce mai e?
Bataile fac parte din folclorul marital la fel de mult ca si popa sau trecutul pragului, sinuciderea Anei era de asteptat desi decizia ei se simte oarecum fortata avand in vedere ca naratorul omniscient transmite trairile ei dintr-o perspectiva distanta, iar moartea copilului face parte din gama de decizii pe care autorul realist nu are nici un motiv sa le faca, in afara de a intretine atmosfera - "da, se poate mai rau, e perfect natural sa fie mai rau, e real".Eu apreciez "Ion" foarte mult deoarece ofera o perspectiva oarecum...

DNF at 42% !!!Warning!!! Spoilers!!! but since people who are not from Romania haven't heard of this book in their lives, Why not entertain yourself a little 😂🤷🏻♀This was probably the shittiest book i've ever (tried to) read for school. I know times were rough in the 40s but at least three (very very long) chapters were exclusively about this stupid man who beat his (very pregnant) daughter for having a child with the man she loved. Just because that meant they would have to get married and he d
I know times were rough in the 40s but at least three (very very long) chapters were exclusively about this stupid man who beat his (very pregnant) daughter for having a child with the man she loved.
And if that wasn't enough, the only reason the protagonist (AKA the baby-daddy AKA Ion) got the girl pregnant was because she was rich and he wanted land, and her being pregnant would mean they would have to get married.
I know arranged marriages were very common at that time, but this is some next level shit.
I really loved this book because it represents the exact live of romanians living in province. Males the supreme owners , they drink a lot and are overprotective for their lands and woman are treated (almost) like slaves , they are good only for giving birth and for non-stop work. This book can teach you so many things! About true love , about a husband who does not see the love of his wife and he dreams about another woman,about hard working people , about obsessive love for land , hate and ignorance.
I liked this book a lot. I think this is the best book I had to read for school till now . The story is original and represents very well the life of romanians in the past . It has many characters , each with a different personality and ideas. The end is unexpected , and almost all characters have got what they deserve . The relationships between the characters change during the story . The writing was good , I wasn't bored reading it . A good book from an good author.
The novel Ion introduces us in the life of the paesants and intellectuals of Transylvania before the war. The action takes place in Pripas village and in the little town Amaradia. Ion al Glanetasului, industrious son of poor parents, has a passion for land. He fixes his eyes on Ana, rich man's, Vasile Baciu, daughter ...This is a story about the "hunger for land" and "hunger for love".
Cine a crescut la țară, măcar în vacanțe la bunici, cred că înțelege mai bine cartea.
Este tragic modul în care românii erau obligați să învețe la școală numai în maghiară, modul în care maghiarizarea a făcut ca unii românii să nu-și mai cunoască limba, să spună că sunt români în limba asupritorilor.Titu Herdelea mi-a plăcut foarte mult și în ''Răscoala'', un tânăr idealist, cu speranțe mari, cu dorința de a deveni martir pentru poporul român dacă este nevoie.După moartea lui Ion povestea mai continuă 20 și ceva de pagini tocmai pentru că timpul nu stă în loc, viața tuturor continuă chiar dacă el este mort, același mesaj transmite și șocul lui Ion când află că Florica s-a măritat cu George, faptul că niciun om nu este cu adevărat important, că în fața timpului nu avem putere și nu cred că acest lucru s-a schimbat într-un veac.Romanul nu mai este de actualitate?
May God have mercy on your souls if you read this.I did.I had to.Because school.Because exams.You know what faces i made when i had to read this?First there was this:Then i had to switch to this:I still taste bile when i think about it.
You know how people reacted to this piece of.........
And do you know what was the first thing i did after finishing high school?No, i didn't drink myself under the table.
I read this book for school.
I had to dissect and analyze it for school.
I knew what I was getting into because generations before me had to read it in school too.
For my teenager self, this book was good enough because I had the dive to finish it.
In my opinion, Ion like any other classic/old book had as a target an older audience 20 and up.
I recommend reading this book when you have a better understanding of the world and its harshness.
It is a slow read or at least it was for me sooo...
as a reader, ana deserved better, but enjoyed a lot titu's character development and the way the author created this general backgroud of one as a young man with strong ambitions, full of ideals, unshaken by the hardships of life.
(also hearded some good opinions on forest of the hanged by the same author, maybe i will give it a chance but not in the near future as i have a lot of goodies prepared on my nightstand)
După ce am trecut de primele 5 capitole ale Glasului Pământului, a început să-mi placă şi am terminat-o foarte repede.În Ion este vorba, pe de o parte, despre viaţa ţăranilor din Pripas, iar pe de altă parte, despre viaţa Herdelenilor şi raporturile dintre clasele sociale.Ţăranii parcă duc o viaţă a lor, lipsită de grijile naţionalităţii zdrobite de unguri sau de cea a îmbogăţirii de cunoştinţe.
Singura problemă a omului, că-i din clasa mijlocie sau cea inferioară, ar fi banul, respectiv pământul şi averea.În alt plan, familia lui Zaharia Herdelea trăieşte undeva între graniţe, în sensul că oscilează între liniştea vieţii la ţară şi haosul adus de unguri, sistematic, în şcoală şi-n instituţiile publice.Herdelea i-a fost învăţător lui Ion, care este un ţăran iubitor de pământ.
If you study the context long enough, you may get it why Slavici was highly innovative (and influential) after a period of „lowbrow” and short-breath prose (though not without some charming pieces; if you ask me, I'd pick Alecsandri's Călătorie în Africa...) and why Rebreanu hit the jackpot at a time when the Romanian novel was still close to non-existent.
Nevertheless, it is easy to see why it is one of the favorite hate targets of pupils who hate having to read canonical books and making stupid pseudo-analysis for the „bac” exams.
Okay, so this was clearly a school read that I expected to hate, but I actually liked it!
Well, I hated Ion, the main character, and he totally deserved what happened to him at the ending of the novel.
And it is pretty obvious that my favourite character was Titu Herdelea, a patriotic and an idealist poet, who didn't care about the unwritten rules of his society and God, he was amazing!
Ana didn't deserve such a tragic fate.
Florica was a pretty flat character, besides her beauty and spontaneity.
Ion deserved his fate.
M-am luptat o perioadă destul de îndelungată cu cartea asta şi până la urmă eu am câştigat, atunci când Ion a murit şi eu am ajuns la pagina 445. :]Desigur, a fost o carte scrisă de-un român care doar descria viaţa la ţară şi accentua nesimţirea unuia şi greutatea uneia de-a trăi odată ce-a păcătuit. Fie, o carte aşa numa, legată de poporu' român prin harţa care-l caracterizează pe Ion şi sclavia în care se scaldă Ana.
mi-a placut cartea, chiar nu ma asteptam, dar a fost interesanta. Liviu Rebreanu a dovedit ca este un scriitor foarte bun, parca "Ion" n-a fost scrisa de el, total diferita de celelalte carti ale lui. Ma bucur c-am citit-o, ii dadeam 5 stelute, dar sincera sa fiu, m-au cam plictisit unele capitole in care se vorbea despre familia Herdelea, in special de Titu..chiar nu-mi place "poetul" :D
*sigh*
Sincera, i-as acorda 0 stelute Daca ar fi posibil.
I expected to hate it.I hated it less than I expected to.But that's my luck and my curse; I never like books I gotta read for school.
Characters belonging to both plans are presented at the beginning of the novel in a symbolical scene of a social event involving traditional Romanian dance.At the center of the action is “Ion al Glanetasului” (“Ion” is the Romanian equivalent of the English name “John”), a poor single male, humiliated and mocked by the rich people of the village.
On the other hand there is Ana, a wealthy ugly girl he does not love, but she is the only way through which he can quickly become rich.Given the fact that the first part of the novel is called Glasul pamantului, Ion’s first choice is not hard to guess.
O opera ce ne arata chinurile suportate de romani, dar si ca destinul te poate aduce unde te astepti cel mai putin.
