Struggling to slap a rating on this novel really crystallized for me the problem with the current star rating system. It's not a bad book. It was moderately entertaining and had some excellent moments of action, story and character interaction. It doesn't deserve the stigma that is associated with the 2 star rating. However, I also didn't "like it" enough to bestow the 3rd star and thus proclaim to the world that all should read this. Tis a quandary.Thus, I figured I could either round up to 3
However, I also didn't "like it" enough to bestow the 3rd star and thus proclaim to the world that all should read this.
PLOT SUMMARY:Written in 1986, this early cyberpunk story takes place in a world that has become cliché for these kinds of novels: **mean, faceless mega-corporations now run the planet from orbital satellites; **artificial intelligence is a reality;**bio-mechanical implants and enhancements are the norm;**guns and ammo are ubiquitous; and **data piracy vs.
Cowboy spends his time scratching out a living helping to break the power-grip of the corporate controlled orbitals.
That said, Walter Jon Williams has writing chops and this book is not bad.
I actually got into the battles, and I've never been one to particularly like military fiction.I was very impressed not only by the execution of this novel, which never felt much like a knock-off, but because I really got into both the main characters.
They weren't bigger than life like Holden in the Expanse or unreliable but still awesome like Kvothe in Name of the Wind.Cowboy and Sarah felt like real people with real problems in a real world doing their real goddamned best in a really shitty situation.I honestly liked this book a lot, even if it isn't my normal cup of tea.
Although I read Gibson's Neuromancer when it came out, I am just now reading the equally vintaged Hardwired. Wish I have discovered it earlier.
You know the bit in Species where Natasha Henstridge sticks her tongue down Anthony Guidera's throat and out through the back of his head? It won the 1996 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss, admittedly against a fairly weak field - Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls was a nominee. But all the same.Anyway, what I wanted to say was: if you liked that scene, then you'll probably like Hardwired too. Just my little tip for the day.
really an amazing novel.The novel has two protagonists, Cowboy, a former fighter pilot, and Sarah, a street smart "hired gun" who's trying to save her brother (who probably isn't worth saving).
Set in a post-Apocalyptic world in which corporations, which have set up shop in orbit, have subdued all the governments of the Earth, the polot of the novel finds Cowboy trying to break the power of the "Orbitals" and Sarah just trying to stay alive long enough to join them.If you like SF a little bit, you have to read this book.
I have a deep personal weakness for 80s cyberpunk, and though I waited many years to finally read this one, it delivers all the chrome and lasers and screaming cybernetic air battles and corporate skullduggery my teenage self could have ever desired. A gritty froth of all that was best and brightest in the SF cliches of a quarter century ago.
More than anything else, Hardwired has shown me how bad the author wants to be William Gibson.
To Walter Jon William's credit, who doesn't?Hardwired takes place sometime in the more distant than not future.
From low earth orbit, the Orbitals, a group of spaceborne corporations, are calling the shots.
The unlikely pair team up with a group of like minded criminals, and together they take on Tempel I.G., the Phartmaceutical company that has begun to slowly take them apart.It's not a bad book, but to be honest...
I read Neuromancer once before.
I could actually pull out a pad of paper and a pencil, write down character names from Neuromancer, then draw a line to their Hardwired counterpart.
Hardwired is hard-core, old school cyberpunk which means lots of action, some introspection and all kinds of inventive technologies.
While parts of the novel feel dated (and they are) the Williams manages to get the reader to invest in both of his protagonists; the wily and lethal Sarah and the just as wily and lethal Cowboy.
Full of victories and setbacks, the action never flags and the heroes suffer betrayals and duplicities from all sides, including each other.
Particularly intriguing is that the novel is set in the aftermath of a devastating war where orbital habitats have bombed the Earth with meteors.
Скъсах се да се смея, когато още в началото на книгата с две изречения беше обхваната цялата фабула на „Водосрез”.Земята е екологична и социална кочина, управлявана от корпорации, намиращи се в орбита.
На този фон наемници и контрабандисти се опитват да оцелеят, прецаквайки орбиталните, но май дори тези им усилия се контролират от корпорациите.Каубой е контрабандист и крадец, бивш военен летец, който си вади хляба с удари по конвоите на фармацефтичните корпорации.
По случайност, точно този, който се опита да светне Сара.Четена сега, книгата сякаш обхваща всяко едно клише в жанра, но разглеждана към времето, когато е писана става ясно, че тия клишета Уилиамс ги е измислил.
Its style _over_ substance, not style instead of substance.
The point is the flash of neon on chrome and the sound of alcohol-fueled turbines drowning out the chatter of miniguns.
I liked the story, but if you're still reading to find out what happens next instead of _how_ it happens, then like the smugglers who pay the panzerboys to run the Line, and think its all about the money, you just don't get it.I love this book for all the things in it that would have been fairly novel when he wrote it, and are now just part of the genre.
Tubli tükk rasket küberpunki ning märulit sellest kuidas sõjajärgsel maal üritavad ex-lahingulendur ning ihukaitsja-tsikk üht orbiidil lösutavat suurkorporatsiooni "maha võtta".
Kõik see on kirja pandud Gibsonlikult lopsakas stiilis ehk autor ei hoia sõnade arvelt kokku kui vaja kirjeldada kuidas kroom läigib ja neoon särtsub.
Maailm ise on maksimaalselt rõve ja vastik, korporatsioonid sigatsevad ning lihtne inimene peab olema ellujäämiseks valmis igasugusteks töödeks ning alandusteks.
PS: Ei saa aru miks seda teost võrreldakse Roger Zelazny "Needuste alleega".
Seda enam, et antud teose sõjajärgne maailm polnud siiski täielikku kaossesse langenud.
PPS: Vähemalt minukätte sattunud versioonis oli loo lõppu susatud veel lühike laast hoopis teiste tegelastega ning kaugemas tulevikus.
Just ya regular action packed gun toting scifi. Not much to write about, other than hits what it needs too and keeps you interested. Pulp scifi really. I will probably continue with the series.
This here is some god damn good cyberpunk.I will be reading the rest.
Guns-and-drugs-and-sex-and-tech-and-power all tangled up and flashing with neon lights.Cowboy is a panzerboy, the pilot of an armored hovercraft smuggling lifesaving medicine across what used to be the midwest, before the orbital corporations shattered Earth's government in a hostile take-over proceeded by meteor bombardment.
When a job and a betrayal brings the two of them together, they decide to fight back: for money, for revenge, for respect, for the sheer thrill of armored combat in the glow of the interface.What transpires is some high-octane action across a jagged world, as Cowboy and Sarah trek across a damaged world writhing under the exploitation of the orbitals.
Loin du Samouraï Virtuel de Stephenson, qui évolue dans une réalité elle aussi virtuelle, et des différentes aventures de Gibson, Câblé s’attache à un aspect du cyberpunk (enfin, qui selon moi en fait partie) qui me semble beaucoup plus intéressant : la fusion de l’homme et de la machine, présenté sous la forme de l’archétype du cowboy moderne.
Pour ce pilote, comme pour bien des gens, passer par un volant et des pédales pour conduire est stupide, surtout quand on peut interfacer son cerveau avec les muscles d’acier de la voiture, avec les capteurs de verre que peuvent être ses caméras, et quand votre corps devient ce monstre d’acier.Et cette vision d’une humanité intégrée aux machines a quelque chose de terrifiant, et d’exaltant à la fois.
I have had this book on my shelf for ten years.
I don't know why I waited to read this book.
I enjoy cyberpunk novels.
This has all the ingredients of a cyberpunk novel.
Evil Corporations, Implants, Cybernetics, Drugs and the Anti-Hero.
Williams has captured the internal struggle between the common man and "the man", aka the people with the power.
I found it hard to put the book down.
A strong addition to the genre of cyberpunk or techno-thriller, what ever you want to call it.
A good read and well worth picking up your own copy.
For fans of the genre, there is very little new here -- it hits upon all of the tropes -- but the author is a great writer who manages to make his prose poetic without being obscure (as Gibson often is).
The author's understanding of technology is thorough enough to paint a post-apocalyptic world with a fair amount of realistic detail, and without resorting to excessive techno-babble.
The real strength of the novel is the characters.
Cowboy and Sarah are familiar archetypes, but they have a depth not often seen in this genre, and they undergo real character development.
Very definitely a cyberpunk novel, right down to the Gibson-esque "multiple narrators telling interweaving stories."There's some good action here, and the premise is solid, but it doesn't stand tremendously well on its own as a novel. I have not read the two sequels, and they may improve on the milieu, but independently, the book sets up a bunch of threads that are left dangling, and the conflict is resolved via a completely ridiculous deus ex machina that is only hinted it in one sentence elsewhere in the book. Chekhov's Gun, I suppose, but still.
Good old fashioned cyberpunk. Impressively, it doesn't feel dated, although that may partly be my due to my love for the genre. The two point of view characters are both reasonably fleshed-out and appealing for different reasons. The tech is delicious, as it should be, and it's a very plausible mix of vehicles, computing, and biochemical developments. The setting -- an Earth dominated by and completely dependent on orbital corporations -- is unique and chillingly plausible, and the narrative fits the setting like a glove.
Be still my mirror-shaded cybernetic heart! ...ok, I get why a lot of reviewers are saying this guy is basically a William Gibson wannabe. In the words of my boyfriend, this is a "bad movie made into a book." But overall, the action scenes were fun to read and I liked the stylistic writing...admittedly, it was a little predictable, but the cheesiness won me over. Turn on your synthesizer music, pop your polyester collar and enjoy.
This is Cyberpunk from its 1980s prime period. The novel spins a web of impersonal megacorporate interests and espionage, with the two lead characters trying to make their way through the dangerous lines. The action, though, is sharp as razors and ice cold vodka. The cover on the edition I read was pretty terrible, though.
Still a classic late '80s favorite of mine. A fun story, which happens to include a perceptive foretelling of tech we now have in-hand and anticipate in our near future, and some predicted glimpses into how society has already adopted new norms to that tech. Go Go Google Glass, anyone?
An old favorite. A sentinel book in cyberpunk with some great western flavor. Some of the character through lines aren't wholly satisfying but the vibe and flavor of the book makes it worth a read.
I don't remember a lot about this book, but I do have a very vivid picture of the way Sarah assassinates the guy in the first few chapters.
And a younger brother to protect and control… Cowboy and Sarah end up working together and as they discover more about the Orbitals, they decide to wage their own war against them.This is Neuromancer-like cyberpunk, and while most of the tropes are the same (hell, Freeside and the Orbitals are not that different as a concept) Hardwired manages to be different from Gibson’s novel while allowing you to enjoy the classical tropes of the genre.
A fun and unique story from the cyberpunk era.
So while it can certainly be compared to the rich prose in Neuromancer, I feel it reaches its own unique style that is a joy to read.
The way these scenes are described is so effective and just plain fun, that it's a shame how (as is usual with action scenes) they are so rare and far between.
Kinda lame, to put it bluntly.Still, I recommend it if you're looking for a well-written story that pleasantly skirts the classic cyberpunk style of story while at the same time doing its own unique thing with the genre.
In fact, fairly decent -- for its time.
The problem is -- and this is NOT the author's fault -- it's basically cyberpunk, and back when this was written, William Gibson was the standard and the genre wasn't glutted like it is now, but unfortunately, if you read it for the first time now, you encounter many now-formulaic and predictable cyberpunk plot devices and descriptions, which again is not the author's fault, as it was fairly original for its time.
It's just that I felt like I've been there, done that a hundred times while reading this, and that's my fault, because I've OD'd on cyberpunk and for the most point, am now avoiding the genre since not many novels seem able to break the formula.
Un clásico ciberpunk al que no le falta nada.
No quiero desvelar los detalles de la trama, pero el Ciberpunk de Williams es un ciberpunk que no conoces ni te han contado.
Un libro escrito en los 80 todavía con capacidad de sorprender a pesar de las toneladas de imágenes y argumentos que hemos visto a través de la televisión y el cine en las tres últimas décadas.La única pega que le podría poner, es acerca de su final, que me ha dejado un sabor de boca algo vacío, demasiado convencional y que desluce la novela, convirtiéndola en algo efímero y sin sustancia, para mi gusto le falta algo más de drama y rotundidad.Lee la reseña completa en mi blog: https://nicholasavedon.com/hardwired-...
Coolest and more cyberpunk of these allies is RENO, a former delta jock that has his meat body killed in a hit meant for Cowboy, only to live on in the 'crystal' of the data networks, a disembodied super-ally that gains the ability to hack Orbital data networks for critical info.The ultimate plan is to form an uneasy alliance with ROON, a minor Tempel executive, and use his insider knowledge to attack Tempel's shipments of its new, experimental vaccine for the Harrington's Disease (name?).
https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3120086.htmlIt's one of the early cyberpunk texts, characters struggling with evil human overlords and the rise of new technology. Cyberpunk doesn't really do all that much for me, and I got really rather lost in the plot, but I liked the characterisation and appreciate the homage to Zelazny's Damnation Alley.
