For example, the author wants her main character, Andy Brazil, to be an intrepid reporter/volunteer cop who is irresistible to men and women alike.
But the Andy she shows us is a petulant, whining adolescent whose favorite lament is, "It's not fair!" The two female leads, Police Chief Judy Hammer and Deputy Chief Virginia West, are not quite as annoying as Brazil, but they are wish-fulfillment characters--smart, driven, and almost god-like in their abilities.
Too bad for them that in Cornwell's world, strong capable women are surrounded by weak, envious men who can't deal with their authority.
The mystery, such as it is, is forgotten for long stretches of the novel while we focus on West's cat, Niles, and what he is thinking and planning.
I'm not sure how I feel about these characters. And why does what I thought to be the Crux of the biscuit keep being pushed to the side for emotional development?Good lord is EVERYONE sexually frustrated???Well I just don't know what to say about all that
This is not part of the Scarpetta series. This book is hilarious. I had no idea Ms. Cornwell had such a great sense of humor!
I remember picking this up, as I’d read a few Scarpetta books by then and obviously thought I’d enjoy this. Well I didn’t like it at all. Couldn’t get into it much and didn’t care at all for the central character.
Audiobook that sustained me while weeding in the yard. Been seeing Cornwell's name for decades so I downloaded this from my library. Also downloaded "Southern Cross" so I'll give one more try.
Fun, fast paced, filled with likeable characters.
As I listened to this book, I found myself falling in love with the idealistic young reporter, Andy Brazil.
Still viewing the world as mostly filled with good people, and completely oblivious to the more sinister and jaded aspects of life, Andy approaches every story and crime scene with an eagerness to help people and to make the world better.
Completely surrounding this young man are women of incredible strengths and at times it is comical watching him try to navigate this new and foreign realm of femininity.
However, it is the characters that make this book great.
Don't know where Cornwell went wrong but this story line just isn't anywhere as good as the Kay Scarpetta storyline. The characters are not as interesting and the story telling is just crappy.
I love Patricia Cornwell's creative description!
Another attitude I can't abide is bleating that a novel "Isn't like her usual series".
I did not have "Postmortem" until recently and enjoyed "Hornet's Nest" as my introduction.I wasn't keen on all threads and characters, especially the redneck wanting to kill Victoria and Andy for defending themselves.
Humour arrived when it was needed, like a parade and funeral challenging a detour!The gift with words I admired came in the first pages, when Victoria eats junk in Judy's office.
I am late to the Patricia Cornwell party but am glad to arrive!
Since reading my first Cornwell book "Postmortem",I have been a Kay Scarpetta fan - reading every book as soon as it comes out.
The plot did seem to wander a bit.( Now I'm not really sure what the plot was.) I did like the idea of some humor thrown in though and I am sure Cornwell is going to pursue these characters in Southern Cross which I just purchased.
You know, I have a feeling PC is trying to let Kay get over the death of her lover, Benton, and also letting their fans get over it too with the introduction of these new characters.
At first it was entertaining to read where the characters were, but by one hundred pages in, Charlotte stopped being interesting as a character in and of itself (read the book, and see what I mean) and became merely annoying.
Mysteries set in New York do not feel obligated to have the characters mention the Statue of Liberty every three pages to give you the flavor of the mise-en-scene; not a page of Hornet's Nest goes by without Cornwell dragging a local reference into it.
Boy, this is crap.I picked it up because it was in the "free" box of books at school when I ran out of book to read during office hours and had no work along with me. I am never getting that two hours back.
Charlotte, North Carolina is Gotham City reinvented--a place of murder, intrigue, and villains so foul they go by outrageous nicknames.
While I enjoyed the exciting story, I don't think Patricia Cornwell is a great writer.
And finally, I did not understand the villains motivations for committing such perverse acts.
Also, as an advocate of transgender people, I did not appreciate the author referring to the criminal as "it" rather than he or she.All in all, I'd say Cornwell has a gift for creating a gripping story that moves along at a snappy pace.
However, the story is more like a movie than a great piece of literature.
I picked this up thinking it would be a Kay Scarpetta mystery, and it took me a couple of chapters to figure it out.
I enjoyed meeting new characters and found this book to be a refreshing change from the Scarpetta series.
The budding relationship between Virginia West and Andy Brazil was fun to watch develop.
I also didn't like the way the author kept saying that others thought the main characters were gay, when neither of the were.
Still, I really enjoyed this book, and want to read the next in the series.
I want to find out what happens to Brazil and West.
This was a rousing audio book that I enjoyed on my travels to the Albany area and later it entertained during my errands around town. The story was about a serial killer who targeted men, killed and then spray painted an orange hour glass pattern, on their private parts. Andy Brazil is a newspaper reporter/ride-a-long guest deputy who helps two fiesty lady cops, in these murders. It was fast paced and exciting. The action kept going until the dramatic end.
This was decent - it was a nice break in everything else I've been reading. I liked the main three characters, but like other reviewers, I did find there to be a plethora of side characters. Some helped the story line, and some I felt could be omitted. I might have to go find the next in the series just to find out what happens to Andy next. I want to know if he becomes a cop, stays a reporter or some other combination!
Don't waste your time reading this book. There was no plot. It is simply a bunch of unrelated incidents strung together. Part of the problem I had reading this book was its omniscient point of view. Omniscient POV is difficult to write and she didn't do a good job of it. It made it difficult to get into any of the characters. I didn't like any of the characters either. I don't even know why I finished reading it.
What is up with this new series? It's stupid! The characters are ludicrous - simple minded and stupid.
Why didn't this one start "Once upon a time ..."? Everything clicked together too smoothly and characters were mostly stereotypes and paperthin.
il nido dei calabroni, preso all'epoca al buio supponendo che fosse il decimo con Kay Scarpetta.
L'Atroce Autrice nomina i personaggi di questa serie parallela per disadatti come "Giuditta Martello" e "Andrea Brasile"!
Non sazia di una scelta da TV-movie in replica su canale regionale nella notte dopo Ferragosto, cala il suo asso col vicecomandante Virginia West che lavorando in West Virginia, � come se il capo dei vigili di Bologna fosse una signora di nome Emilia Romagna.
Semplicemente che i personaggi della serie Scarpetta diventavano sempre pi� macchiette o bandiere di un movimento.
I read the 3 Andy Brazil books against advice from more than one person.
I liked the Scarpetta books (although I thought that the endings of some of those books were too rushed, too contrived).
The Andy Brazil books are nothing like those!
I persisted to the end of these books because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Scarpetta fans who pay full price for these books will feel angry and very much cheated.
Readers whose first taste of Cornwell is one of these books will never buy another.
Whatever you do, don't pay full price for these books!
Unexpected characters in this book, Andy is a weird young fellow, exceptionally talented and good looking (like many leading men!) but shy and awkward, he fancies much older, strong women but is unable to do anything about it.
Deputy Chief West is around forty, tough, hard working, honest and again exceptionally good at her job.
Between them Andy as a reporter and volunteer cop and West clear up a lot of crimes while being stalked.
This book really held my interest but it was definitely a bit odd, the disconnect between the characters being one of the main reasons, nevertheless, I enjoyed it and will read the next one.
I read so many bad (actually terrible) reviews about this book. While I didn't think it was up to par with the Scarpetta books I didn't think it was as bad as described. It certainly wasn't the worst book I've read. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and really grew to like the main players, i.e., Brazil, West and Hammer. What's not to like: There was a murder scenario to figure out; corruption; sexual tension; dark sarcastic humor; action; drama and the like. I look forward to the continuing saga.
I was surprised this isn't a Scarpetta novel, but #1 Andy Brazil novel.
This is so refreshing for Patricia Cornwell to write.
I will be looking forward for #2 next.
This story is about a bright young reporter that wants to get into the nitty-gritty of police work which gives him so much more great material for the newspaper stories he writes.
He impresses the chief and the deputy chief, so much that both women get involved in police work away from the desk all because of him, describing these two women as Batman and Robin in the paper.
New York Times Number 1 bestseller on February 2, 1997. The first in the Andy Brazil series. The characters Andy Brazil (Observer newspaper writer), Chief Judy Hammer of police Charlotte, North Carolina, & Deputy Chief Judy West - professional & other relationships were good in the story. The ending drama between West & Andy was good and not expected based on other relationships those two had in the book.
Patricia Cornwell turns from forensics to police procedures in her latest novel, Hornet's Nest. This book is less a thriller than a character study of the main characters: Judy Hammer, chief of police in Charlotte, North Carolina; Hammer's deputy, Virginia West; and Andy Brazil, a young reporter assigned to ride with the police as they go about their jobs.
This was a very good read! After reading to much about Dr. Scarpetta Andy Brazil was a good change. I really have enjoyed the first two in this series even though I read #2 first then #1... but both very entertaining
Don't bother. Nothing can compare to Cornwell's books startting Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta. I could not get in tot Andy Brazil books. Since she only did a couple and then started back up with Scarpetta, I don't think many others could get into this series either.
Frais, drôle et terriblement efficace, le premier livre à introduire le personnage de Judy Hammer, Virginia West et Andy Brazil, maladroit et beau gosse) a tout pour plaire. ça m'a beaucoup changé des enquêtes de scarpetta.
The books of this series disappoint after reading the Scarpetta series
Love Patricia Cornwell but hated this book.
