Visceral poetry. Brings to mind Keats. The translations mostly hover in the fair-to-midland range, (trans. by Gregory Brengauz), ie, readable, but only really heart wrenching if you've got enough Russian to supplement with reading the originals along with it. It's my new translation project.
The absolute peak of turn of the century poetry, yet so far removed from its meaning when translated to English. Please, learn Russian so you can read his works.

Какая ночь! Я не могу...Не спится мне. Такая лунность!Еще как будто берегуВ душе утраченную юность.***Что отлюбили мы давно,Ты — не меня, а я — другую,И нам обоим все равноИграть в любовь недорогую.
Elveda dostum,Ölmek yeni bir şey değildir bu dünyada,Ama yaşamak da yeni bir şey olmasa gerek.
This is a unique in the history of English literature translation of all poetical works of a Russian poet preserving his rhithms and rhymes. But Sergey Yesenin, the romantic soul of Russia, poet-genius, deserves this more than anybody else. One could learn from this book what is the real great poetry.
Very good, real poetruy
sən ölməli oğul döördün, brat :(
