The covers instantly caught my eye - and as much as the saying goes "don't judge a book by its cover" I could not help myself.
Now I must point something out - The UK editions of science fiction books of this era had a habit of having garish, eye catching covers often which had no relation to the contents of the book.
This was one such edition - however the cover they chose was from the artist Chris Foss - one of my all time favourite artists who to me captured the impossible and limitless imagination of science fiction.
The other 11 stories are clearly lower-quality, at least for me.ESPAÑOL: Esta colección de cuentos y novelas cortas de Asimov contiene 15 títulos publicados en los años cincuenta.
El que más me gustó fue El pasado muerto, sobre cómo ver el pasado en una pantalla, seguido por Espacio Vital, una de las primeras apariciones del Multiverso Cuántico de Everard en la ciencia-ficción, Satisfacción garantizada, un cuento poco conocido de la serie de Susan Calvin y los robots, y El chistoso, una historia original sobre el origen del humor humano.
US Robots have developed a housework robot, which they are going to field test in the home of one of their employees.
The action focusses on the uneasy relationship that develops between the robot and the bored housewife, who's plagued with general feelings of helplessness and inadequacy; the robot, programmed with the Three Laws and obliged to protect her from anything that might be liable to cause her harm, does its best to address the problem.
If someone told me it was an adapted version of a Colette short story, I'd be prepared to believe them.
This was my first ever book read by Asimov, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Especially the stories that involved Multivac. It really is true, no one spits out story ideas faster then Asimov, and I was especially surprised to find out that he also wrote in verse. A very unexpected surprise. I look forward to reading other works by this amazing story teller.
Para mi, que aprendí los conceptos de la robótica de la mano de Susan Calvin y conocí los problemas sociales de un Imperio espacial investigando crímenes violentos con un robot por detective...en fin, que aprendía a disfrutar de la ciencia ficción con Isaac Asimov leer un libro nuevo cuando pensaba solo repasarlo supone un regalo inesperado (aún sabiendo que nunca lograré leer todos los libros que escribió, firmó o colaboró...)"Con la Tierra nos basta" es una colección de cuentos alrededor de los temas típicos de Asimov: robots, grandes sociedades dominadas por UNIVAC (ordenadores enormenmente complejos y potentes), paradojas del avance de la ciencia, etc.
Ebn algunos todo el cuento es una enorme broma.
Es Asimov en sus mejores momentos: ideal para una primera aproximación, perfecto para volver a recuperar el contacto si eres un fan.
An interesting collection of short stories, some of the better ones I'd previously experienced in The Complete Robot so the novelty of reading such good stories was worn off and possibly detracted from my overall enjoyment.The collection also featured some of Asimov's fantasy stories, my first experience of such things, and even though I consider him a good writer of good ideas my eyes just glazed over at the mention of faeries and Avalaon for example.
And as bonus reading a couple of attempts at humourous poetry about being a science fiction writer.
Vor allem, weil sie sich nicht ausschließlich um Roboter dreht - obwohl der Titel das vermuten lässt.So ist es hauptsächlich die Idee eines allumfassenden Großrechners ("Multivac"), die von Asimov in den Mittelpunkt seiner Erzählungen gestellt wird.
Asimov löst das natürlich bravourös auf und erklärt alles mit den Gesetzen der Robotik - und gerade das ist es, was ein wenig Horror in die Geschichte zaubert, wie ich finde.Das ist aber noch lange nicht alles.
Besonders unterhaltsam ist dabei übrigens die Art und Weise, wie Asimov die Geschichte erzählt, beginnt sie doch mit einem Fabriksbesitzer und dessen Vater.
It was a pretty good read though, and I especially liked the final story.
That’s because it’s the story that inspired Bill Holt and his album, Dreamies.But honestly, all of the stories in here are pretty good, and it’s got me excited about reading more Asimov on the weeks and months to come.
It’s been too long since I read any of his work.Oh, and for the record, my favourite stories were The Dead Past, An Immortal Bard and Dreaming is a Powerful Thing.
But you could pick out any of these stories at random and still enjoy it.
Most of the stories happen in the first century of 2000, and the vision of what would be the future (computers, robotics, political systems, values, etc) is interesting and funny.
Not for me, kind of stupid tale about the first contact with venusians.· Living Space · ss Science Fiction Stories May ’56: Parallel universes.

A decent collection of Asimov with its usual mix of repressed titillation and shaggy dog stories (e.g an alien delegation is rebuffed by a rube who thought they said they were from "Venice," rather than "Venus." ugh).
The unifying gimmicks that all the stories take place on Earth, but this was probably more of a novelty in the 50's than in today's more dystopian genre.
The endless, deathless, futile hordes, marching towards nothing, imprisoned in an eternity of boredom and pointlessness - it's a genuinely disquieting image; though Asimov pulls back before it tumbles into outright horror.
Interesting thought.Franchise ****Original idea: simplify elections, one representative voter identified by the central computer Multivac is enough.The Watery Place ***Aliens ask for contact, are satisfied with a 'no' and never come back again.
Wrong place, wrong time.Satisfaction Guaranteed *****Characteristically Asimov.
The Last Trump ****What really would happen when the last day is there and resurrection comes.
Recommended reading for religious fanatics.The Fun They Had **In a future like this there will be millions of jobless teachers.Jokester ****Did Douglas Adams know this story when he was creating Big Thought?Someday ***What are machines dreaming of?
This book, like many other Asimov books, is classic. It can be considered as early science fiction. Except for a few anomalies like punch cards, Asimov’s imagination and stories fit in well still today. The technological advances humanity has achieved over time do not affect the impact of these stories. When I was reading it, I forgot the fact that these stories were written in 1950s. I think one can still see the possibilities of some of Asimov’s imagined futures even today. Like many other reviewers, “Satisfaction Guaranteed” is my favorite from this collection.
I was intrigued by the earth setting of these stories from a grandmaster of science fiction. They are really great reads, all of them. They are all very unique and very real, as in, I can imagine them happening in the future. His scenarios are never too far-fetched, just close enough to reality to make us really shiver to think of what it would truly be like. I love it. Good stories.
You forget while reading it that the stories are from the 50s....most would not seem out of place if written today. I enjoy the sly humor of many of the pieces...and recommend that you read "The Election" to see how he thought we'd be voting in 2008. =]
The man can imagine! The book is a 'back to the future' trip. Fascinating stories!
A book with a link to 1 of 4 elements: Earth.This is a collection of sci-fi stories by the master Isaac AsimovThe Dead Past - Arnold Potterley, Ph.D. wants permission to use the Chronoscope so that he might view ancient Carthage to disprove some claims that were made about that civilization.Franchise - Norman Muller has been selected.
Each election a single voter selected by the MultiVac computer votes on behalf of everyone.Gimmicks Three - One of Satan's recruits makes a deal with a man.
It's likely that Asimov and his editors probably had their collective tongues firmly planted in their cheeks and grins on their faces when they tweaked the noses of Asimov's contemporary authors by proving that you didn't need rocket ships and space opera to write great science fiction.While he didn't wander too far from home in terms of setting, Asimov used his fertile imagination and probing intellect to weave stories that will touch you in a wide variety of ways.
I don't personally feel like it was a comprehensive selection of his best work, but it definitely was comprehensive, containing poems, short stories of a couple of pages and other of up to 50.
I did enjoy some of the stories, especially the final story "dreaming is a private thing" which actually formed a great allegory for the current upsurge in virtual reality tech, it's always impressive to see vintage sci-fi writers who predict the future years before digital technology was even suggested.Still, some of the stories fell a little flat for me, I feel like they didn't always pack the punchy impact that a short stories need to seem more than simply self-indulgent.
It was written before home computers existed, so the computer technology depicted in the collection consists mainly of gigantic, bookshelf-sized and stadium-sized computers, which operate on vacuum tube circuitry, transistors, and something like Turing tape.
The human characters, who are supposed to be living in the ’90s or 2000s, still use paper stationery quite regularly, but they feed the stationery into their computers, and receive feedback from the computer in the form of printed Turing symbols, which they have to translate into English, or they opt to receive audio output.
I read this as part of "The Complete Stories, Volume 1." But I felt I had to review the separate books in that compilation separately because they were so different.
I love Isaac Asimov, especially his robot stories, but most of these were just strange.
He also has a hard time ending some of these stories, often reverting to the classic "aliens were secretly controlling everything!" gimmick.
There are some stories that are worth reading.
The rest of the book was full of some of my least favorite stories, and I usually love Asimov.
I decided last month that I would include in my immediate “to read” pile, books from the far reaches of my shelves and this was the first product of that resolve. I was astounded. This was published in 1957 (61 years ago) and I expected it to have dated, but it has not, not at all. The ideas are as innovative as ever, Asimov always showed great and organised imagination, and he wrote extremely well. I am not a particular aficionado of short stories, but I loved these. What a pleasure!
SF short stories, a few worthwhile, most pretty forgettable. The most notable of them is "The Dead Past," which involves a machine that can view any scene in the past--a good conceit, but it's crammed into a story about an authoritarian government that controls all scientific research, and the story doesn't develop any of its various ideas enough. Another, "Gimmicks Three" has an amusing take on deals with the devil, but most are too short to develop the premises fully.
What an imagination. Forgot it was written in the 50s. Best: Franchise, Satisfaction Guaranteed and the Last Trump. Superb stories!
siempre es un placer leer a asimov, sus cuentos brillantes y soñadores
Buenos relatos. Algunos me gustaron más que otros, desde luego, como el de El pasado muerto que me parece genial.
A good collection of Asimov's short stories. Some, like "The Dead Past", are truly delightful.
A very good collection of short stories by Asimov. One drawback is it was written so long ago that computers are the size of buildings. neat concepts though.
These stories have not aged well
I owe Isaac Asimov an apology.
Having read his Foundations trilogy as a teenager, I mostly thought of him as a stuffy sci-fi writer: one of the old school whose work hasn't aged well.This collection of short stories set me straight.
Asimov was actually very broad in his topics.
I'm less inclined to see him as a sci-fi writer and more as a rationalist.
He would take seemingly absurd stories and place a sense of rationality into them.
There are stories here about parallel universes, demons and angels, the biblical apocalypse, dream harvesters,a device that sees the past, even fairies.I found the book to be a brilliant collection of wildly imaginative stories, all still rooted in the logic of good sci-fi.
A very nice collection of short stories, with Mr. Asimov's unique style. It is dated – the computers take up blocks and blocks, and there is mention of slide rules as well. The best one is 'The Watery Place,' but the one that, perhaps, ruins science fiction is 'The Foundation of S. F.' because it takes the mystery out of how it is written.'The Dead Past' – A professor of Ancient History wants to see into the past for his work, bu the bureaucracy is in his way (the government has been trying to
The computers are blocks long and no one can truly understand how they work, but it seems to be working, so the people let them rule.'Gimmicks Three' – Isadore Welby has sold his soul to the devil, but he finds his way out of it.'Kid Stuff' – A fantasy writer is visited by an elf, one he may have written about, only this one is evil.'The Watery Place' – Bart Cameron is a hard bitten character and during tax season he is worse.'Living Space' – In the future there are homes for everyone in alternate universes, but there is a limit.'The Message' – A time traveler finds his way to World War II, North Africa, for his research project.'Satisfaction Guaranteed' – A new model robot needs testing and Claire Belmont gets to test it.'Hell Fire' - A different way of looking at an atomic explosion.'The Last Trump' – There is an argument in Heaven over whether to end the world or not.
