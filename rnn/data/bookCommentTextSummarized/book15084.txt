Hmm, maybe that's why Zoe took so long to fall for him, LOL.As for the search for Zoe's "key", it was obvious - for me, not for Zoe - that the answer was (view spoiler)[linked to her accepting Brad's love, (hide spoiler)] so the mystery part of the story didn't add much spark to make this an engrossing read.
While I understood the reason behind the way NR chose to end the story, I was left feeling that (view spoiler)[Zoe and Brad were "cheated": I would have liked to see them in a special one-on-one final scene, the same way their friends had in the previous books.
Hele ki bunlar Anahtar Serisi gibi içinde her şeyi barındıran türlenden ise.Malory, Dana ve Zoe, üçüncü kitap ile Kelt tanrıçalarını serbest bırakmakta son adıma geliyorlar.
Ve ona yardım edecek kişi de Brad.Zoe’in yüzünü süsleyen tabloyu görür görmez alan ve onu yıllar sonra karşısında kanlı canlı bulan Brad’in nasıl hissettiğini tahmin edebilirsiniz.Erkek karakterimizin Zoe’ye karşı olan sevgisi ve hayranlığı elbette ki özenilesi olsa da Zoe’nin bu ilgiye uzun bir süre direndi.
Ve Zoe’nin oğlu ile olan iletişimini de çok sevdim.
Kimisini kendi cesareti, kimisini de dostları ve Brad sayesinde aşmayı başardı.Zoe, Dana ve Malory’nin de iş kurma planları tam gaz devam ediyordu.
I can keep going with many more euphemisms to escape the blunt pleasure I get when reading a book.Simply put, this is the 3rd trilogy of Nora's that I've read.
Though I laughed less with this book, it still brought home all the joys and loves I have about reading.
This book is one of my faves, especially with Zoe's young son Simon in it because he was the icing on top of my cupcake, because I'm a romantic and it really hits home of what I've dreamed, fought for, am still fighting for and wanted.
good ending to a good trilogy.i will be reading more nora roberts in future.
Magic, destiny and gods, that's the new reality of Zoe McCourt for the past two months.
Malory will handle the art galery, Dana manage the library/tea room and Zoe have the beauty salon.
But Brad is not a man who give up and when he want something, there's no stopping him, no matter the time it will take.
It make him sound like a ruthless man but he's the opposite.
Awareness, annoyance and attraction, what a great way to tell us Zoe and Brad's love story.
Individually, they were great characters and as a couple they were just as awesome.
I absolutely loved the relationship between Simon and Brad..
If you've read the others, you know what you're getting into so I'll keep my remarks short.At the start, Roberts takes Simon (Zoe's son) off the table as an attack vector for Cain.
Also, it allows Brad to develop a natural relationship with Simon and seeing that evolve was a lot of the charm of the book.I was a bit worried that Zoe would make a lousy warrior type and was pleasantly surprised with how well her protective instincts meshed with her innate stubbornness to make someone who would fight Cain with all that she had without flinching or defaulting before the fight began.
The third and final book in this trilogy equals the first two.
It's Zoe's quest to find the third and final key to unlock the Daughters of Glass.
Added into the mix is romance and intrigue as she examines her past in light of her present.
Kane tries to tempt her into giving into despair while Bradley does his utmost to win the love of Zoe, the warrior of the trio that includes Dana and Malory.Will she succeed in finding the key before her month is up, or will the quest be a failure?
What does her son Simon play in the quest?
How about Bradley?
And sometimes doing what makes you happy is harder and scarier than doing what's safe."In this third and last book in Nora Robert's Key trilogy Zoe must come to terms with her past and her present if she is to locate the final key, the Key of Valor, and release the three daughters from their imprisonment.I really can't say enough about this series.
I loved learning more about Zoe in this book and finding out what makes her tick.
I loved seeing her grow as a character as she learned to accept help from others, and that it is okay to care about and depend on friends and family.
Such a wonderful book!!! This ends the trilogy of the keys. And, it goes out with a bang! Nora Roberts has the gift of bringing all three books together seamlessly, building on the excitement in each book, then wrapping it all up to a beautiful happy ending.
I loved Zoe McCourt, her sweet son, Simon, and her relationship with Brad.
But she's shocked to discover that she's been chosen - along with two other women, Malory and Dana - to take on the magical, centuries-old quest of finding three hidden keys, which will unlock three tortured, trapped demigoddess souls.Through the first two books, Malory and Dana find their respective keys, and they also find love with Flynn and Jordan - men who became integral parts of their missions.
He's determined to be a part of her quest, and to keep Simon safe - but after all that Zoe's been through, it's hard to put her faith in a man.
This may have been my favorite of all three. But then again, reading these back to back made the experience so much better and satisfying! Love the Irish mythology and the HEAs!
Serinin son kitabı.. yine güzeldi. Özellikle Simon'a bayıldım. O küçük oğlan nedense beni benden aldı 😍 Başka bir şey yazmama gerek yok zira Nora ablayı biliyoruz..
Zoe and Bradley...and Simon...Zoe - hairdresser, mother, resourceful, ...
Abandoned by father, oldest of 4, mother a hairdresser from their trailer...
at 16 she fell in 17 year old, son of one of her mother's rich client.
they live in a small house of their own, where she did a lot of the home improvements herself.
with a great game room.This trilogy was written differently than others...
it is in fact one long story, that highlights a different woman, but all of them are growing...
Often trilogies seem like 3 separate stories...
It was a little predictable after reading the 1st 2 novels but that's to be expected with trilogies like this.In the first & second book I was a very big fan of Zoe but once I read her story...
But she is a loving mother & very much a Little Warrior.Brad - the good guy, perfection on earth, there was absolutely nothing wrong with him...
Can you say boring?!?Simon however was such a little charmer and a total doll.
He really made the story for me.
In terms of which books I liked better, I'd put the books in order as #2, #3, then #1.
I have no self-restraint and stayed up way too late reading this book (of course, it might also have something to do with drinking a latte at 5 in the afternoon!).
Of the series, this was the story that I was most looking forward to reading.
The first two books both offered lots of lead-up to this story of the third seeker, which was very appropriate considering the characters involved.
The lead-up in the previous titles was a lot more exciting for me than the romance itself, and the search-for-the-key plotline was just losing its lustre for me.
A lot of the same as the first two books, but nonetheless, a good conclusion to a solid trilogy.I found all three books to be sharp, engaging, and witty. Roberts is good at mixing fantasy elements with contemporary fiction. Nothing profound or groundbreaking here, just a fun story. While I didn't find Zoe as interesting as Malory or Dana, I thought she was much more self aware and mature. I liked that all three girls were very different too.
I read this awhile ago but forgot to post it here. Great book!
4.5 Stars. Yeah... this series is all about Zoe and Brad. And Simon. OMG he's an adorable sweetheart.Reread: August 2013Reread: September 2015
A conversa de homem para homem entre Simon e Brad é do melhor que há
I love you Grandma, but thank goodness these are over. See my review for the first book.
I liked the book but felt it didn't draw me in like the first two. there were times where my interest wasn't there. overall I rate it a 3 1/2 to 4 stars. I did love how Brad and Simon had a great relationship!!
Fluffly light and good fun.
*4 valor & courage stars*Key of Valor is third, and last, book in Key trilogy.
She had a difficult life - after her father left her family she had to help her mom raise her younger brothers and sisters and help provide for their life only to fall in love with a boy, end up pregnant and left by him.
When he first saw the painting 'After the Spell' he fell in love with Zoe's although he didn't know her, so when he finally met her he wasn't about to let her stand in the way of making her his.
Trouxe este livro ao mesmo tempo que o seu antecessor para poder ler a série quase de seguida.Com o último livro ficamos a conhecer a história de Zoe, a mulher responsável de encontrar a última chave que permitirá libertar as almas das Filhas de Vidro.
Zoe é uma mulher de coragem e desde o início que estava com curiosidade para saber o que é que o livro dedicado a ela lhe reservava.
Foi um livro muito mais focado no romance e no crescimento da relação entre Brad e Zoe. Na minha opinião, de todas as mulheres convidadas a encontrarem as chaves, Zoe era aquela que mais afeição tinhas às Filhas de Vidro.
Zoe McCourt is the last one to have to find the key, if she doesn't her friend's work will have been in vain and the Daughters of Glass will continue locked up in their coffins.
the only problem is that she also feels very attracted to him.Brad is attracted to Zoe from book one.
But it is in her strength and courage that she finds the forces to accept who she is and reach her goal.Like I said these three stories read like one big book and I think that it was a good thing that I read them one after the other.
It’s a testament to her character development that by the end of the book I really liked her and thought her romance with Brad was lovely.One thing I love about Roberts’ characters is that she doesn’t follow the romantic stereotype of the’ virgin heroine.’ Zoe is a single mother who had her son at sixteen.
I loved the way Zoe ended up finding her Key, and the way all the couples in the trilogy (including Rowena and Pitte) had a fitting resolution to their stories.
I could have read another trilogy based around Malory, Dana and Zoe just to continue their stories for a bit longer.
Kelt tanrılarından biri bir ölümlüye aşık olur ve kızı kendi dünyasına getirtir.
Bu 3 fani de aynı kasabada yaşayan Malory, Dana ve Zoe isimli kadınlardır.
Malory sanat galerisinde çalışmakta ve işinde huzursuzluk yaşamaktadır, Dana da kütüphanede çalışmakta kitaplarla kafayı bozmuş bir kadındır ve o da huzursuzdur, Zoe ise bir kuaförde çalışan yetenekli elleri olan ve 9 yaşında bir oğlu bulunan genç kadındır.
Önce Malory bulur ilk kitapta, ikinci de Dana, en son heyecanlı bir bitiş ile Zoe bulur.
Malory kalbini Dana'nın üvey abisi Flynn'e kaptırır.
Onların anahtarları bulmasını engelleyen Kane isimli kötü bir büyücü de vardır ve onları içlerine çektiği düşlerle vazgeçirmeye çalışmaktadır.
É esta recusa e indecisão infundamentadas (já que Brad é simplesmente perfeito, tanto para ela como para o seu filho Simon) que tornam o desenvolvimento do livro consideravelmente aborrecido...e Zoe chega a parecer uma grandessíssima chata: para uma mulher que foi sozinha, de noite,a uma mansão sombria, cujos proprietários não conhecia e aceitou fazer parte de uma missão completamente alucinada tendo como base apenas o que lhe foi dito por um casal estranho e sinistro...Zoe tem demasiada dificuldade em confiar num homem que ficou a conhecer muito bem e que não apresentou o mínimo sinal suspeito.
