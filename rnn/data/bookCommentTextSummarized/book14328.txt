Orson Scott Card described his novel Seventh Son as an American epic fantasy, contrasting with the uncompromisingly British Tolkeinesque genre of fantasy books.
Card, telling a story perhaps set in the 1810-20s makes this even more interesting by slowly unraveling the American past into an alternative history fiction, remaking the American foundation into one more accessible for a fantasy writer.
Having said that, I enjoy a good series, find distraction in an ongoing story and a seemingly endless parade of interesting characters, but winding up one chapter should not simply be a cliffhanging commercial break (pun intended) to get to the next installment.
They present an alternate-history account of a nineteenth-century America in which magic is a potent force.
Although it might not be evident to non-Mormons, this series is a thinly veiled fictional adaptation of the life of Mormon prophet Joseph Smith (just as his Homecoming Saga is a similarly thinly veiled science-fiction version of the story of the first part of the Book of Mormon).
As such, it tends either to enthrall or horrify Mormon readers (just as did Saints, his overtly historical novel about Joseph Smith and polygamy--see my review of Saints).
They should particularly appeal to those who like to see magic treated intelligently in a series.
I'm re-reading this book now and, is it just me or does it seem like OSC could actually WRITE BETTER back then?He doesn't write like this anymore.
That book just isn't as strong because every character is taken over to lecture the audience, and who wants that?I do not.
I want a good book.Like this one!
It doesn't fill me with rage the way Ender's Game does or Lost Boys or so many other books I liked by OSC one does.
It just makes this little story a trifle more interesting, because you see, our main character Alvin goes through A LOT of the things that Joseph Smith did, growing up.
Like Smith, Alvin has parents who disagreed about religion and like the Smith family, Alvin’s family practices a religious folk magic in addition to Christianity.
Card has pulled out all the stops and made Alvin into the special-est snowflake that he possibly could.I have to say that the religiousness of the book’s characters (especially in the beginning) was a bit off-putting for me, but by about half way through I had reached some kind of stasis and was enjoying the story more.
DNFI can't quite put my finger on why I didn't like this book.
I read about 80 pages and just couldn't go on.
I found the story to be pretty boring, and it seemed very bogged down in religion.
On top of this, I found the character names to be inexcusably silly.
Maybe I just don't 'get' it?
I read The Ender Quintet and Enchantment in high school, and really loved the story lines.
Because of my previous positive reactions to other Orson Scott Card works, I thought that this was a no-brainer.
Judging by this first installment, Card's Tales of Alvin Maker series is a strong contribution to the latter.Set in 1800-1810 in what would be, in our world, the Ohio and Indiana frontier, this novel describes the birth, and significant times in the young childhood, of Alvin Miller, the uniquely gifted seventh son of a seventh son, born into a frontier America in which the folk magic of our world's old superstitions actually works and plays a significant part in people's lives.
4.5 stars. Fresh, original fantasy using the United States of the 19th century as its backdrop. This creation of a truly "American" fantasy novel was truly original and I thought made it a cut above a lot of cookie cutter fantasy stories.

But I keep thinking about how Seventh Son stacks up against Ender’s Game, and while that is a battle the former could never possibly win, I think it’s useful to examine why I liked one Card book so much and disliked another (albeit not with proportional intensity).
Yet as the book progresses and the Unmaker seems to get more and more desperate, Thrower degenerates into a Renfield-like character with little intelligence or ambition of his own.For what it’s worth, Seventh Son is well-written, provided you can tolerate the dialect Card throws in for good measure.
This book is a clear, fantasy parallel of the life of Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of Mormonism.
If you are a Mormon, you will probably appreciate it even more.But if you are like me, and know about Smith's life, but believe his church's message is false, you might find it a bit painful.
Joseph Smith, before he had his revelation from God and began his own church, was involved in witchcraft.
The most common explanation is what is seen here: Joseph Smith was involved in "white magic," a kind of light witchcraft that coexists perfectly with Christianity, and indeed expresses it better than churches do.
(Not that evangelicals don't have their own stereotypes and prejudices against Mormons.)
I flew through this. Immensely interesting, this is a brilliantly imagined piece of alternate history quasi-fantasy. Convoluted genre? Yes, but Card just keeps proving to me what a compelling storyteller he is. Don't expect unicorns and magical swords (thankfully), but try it and you'll find a realistic take on folk magic mixed with an alternate story of the birth of our nation that complement each other beautifully and seamlessly. Loved it.
Having only just recently discovered the wonder that is Ender's Game and all its sequels (in my mind they have an odd kind of kinship with Dune now that I've read a few) I still thought to myself, "A fantasy?
It's so *American* in a way that other fantasy I've read is so not.
Fantasy has always seemed so European (and within that mostly British) to me, but this is incredibly American, and rather Appalachian and I'm loving the series.
I'm on a Card kick now and loving his prose and his deft portrayal of human nature and all the complicated thoughts and motives and vices of his characters.
Originally posted at FanLit."When you’re surrounded by light, how do you know whether it’s the glory of God, or the flames of Hell?"Set in an alternate American frontier, Seventh Son is the first in Orson Scott Card’s THE TALES OF ALVIN MAKER.
Is this folk magic superstitious nonsense, evil witchery, or a gift from God?Seventh Son begins with an emotionally gripping scene as one child dies and another is born to the Miller family.
Included in the audiobook version is an afterword by Orson Scott Card which explains the origin of Hatrack River and Seventh Son.Published in 1987, Seventh Son was nominated for the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards and won a Locus Award.
Much of the novel looks at the efforts the Unmaker uses to try and destroy Alvin.
At this point, Alvin makes a vow to not use his powers for selfish gains, a decision that becomes pivotal in the final stages of the novel.As with "Ender's Game" the strength of Orson Scott Card's story is his ability to relate authentic, believable young characters.
It ends up feeling a bit too episodic at times and while the novel is supposed to introduce us to Alvin and his universe, I still can't help coming away feeling like the overall experience was incomplete.
Nos encontramos en el siglo XIX, en una Norteamérica alternativa, donde la Revolución Americana nunca existió, y el Lord Protector todavía sigue en Inglaterra.
La magia existe, pero se trata de una magia asociada al folklore popular.
En este entorno, será donde nazca Alvin, el séptimo hijo varón de un séptimo hijo varón, lo que le augura un destino lleno de desafíos.'Alvin Maker: El séptimo hijo' (Alvin Maker: Seventh Son, 1987), del escritor Orson Scott Card, es un libro magnífico, con personajes llenos de vida.
Se trata del primer libro de una saga de seis, y es mi favorito de todos ellos.
Ben Franklin is a wizard that can pull lightning out of the sky...whaaat? George Washington was beheaded for treason...whaaat? Thomas Jefferson impregnated lots and lots of slave girls...whaaat?...no wait that one is real. A story about an alternative America that was founded on religious freedom that involved a little magic mixed in. Less than spectacular and not very much excitement but well written and still interesting. There was no ending to the story. It just ran out of pages
But it's well written and you think okay so that's the intro, now the story.Nope.More intro, more set up, lots of exposition and establishing of things that don't need to be established.The writing, the premise, the characters are all fine.
The problem with that is it gives the writer licence to just make things happen for no reason (it's the will of the Divine, don't you know) and you end up with convenient escapes from tricky situations.Even with all that i liked the premise of an alternate America with magic and I think I would have still given it the benefit of the doubt if it had had an actual story (Star Wars is part of a series, but it doesn't end when Luke decides to leave the farm).
But young Alvin, the seventh son of the title, is not Ender, and comparing their stories is like comparing apples to pears: not the very same species, but belonging to the same extended family.
Where Ender and Alvin match is where two extraordinary boys stand at the crossroads dominion versus true leadership and must make a choice.Leaving Ender aside, Seventh Son is one of the most magical books I have ever read, and that is because it is so completely and unapologetically an American fantasy.
**Spoilers, not much though**Nothing about this book really wow’d me or stood out enough for me to say “here friend, you’d love this book,” The selling feature of this book to me was that it was written by Orson Scott Card, which only makes the fact that it didn’t do anything for me all the more disappointing.
I’ll continue to read this series and hope it picks up but if you’re looking for a thrilling fantasy book (or even an interesting book) this isn’t the place to look.
The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because his writing style and descriptions are interesting.But in this book there is no plot, no clear and specific conflict.
There is a vague, shadowy insinuation that some big invisible force wants to destroy everything for no particular reason, but apparently this force isn't very strong because so far all it can do is throw rocks at a little boy and miss.
But it's probably not the same as the big invisible force that also wants to destroy everything.
The "Alvin Maker" series was my second contact with O.S. Card after the "Ender" series, and I'm delighted to say it's different and it's still good.
The magic is treated very "practically", like an extra talent that you need to work on to develop, and thankfully it doesn't take over the book while still being an important part of it.
The one negative thing is that I didn't get into the main character's skin like I did in the "Ender" series, but not because the characterization isn't good (it's actually one of the strongest points of Card's work).
I started reading this to some of my kids. So far, it has been really good. There was not any of the Card vulgarity that is present in some of his other books. Some of that did come into the 3rd book in the series, but it was done tastefully if I remember properly.This book was a great read for the kids, and they enjoyed it. One of my kids guessed that it was a parallel to Joseph Smith's life, but it's so minimal that it's hard to notice if you're not specifically looking for it.
3,5/5  Anlatımı hoş(hafif Neil Gaiman'ın "Yıldız Tozu" kitabı tarzında); fakat gereğinden fazla uzatılmış bir kitap. Kitap bittiğinde ise tüm kitap boyunca hikayenin girişinden bahsedildiğinden, devamını merak etmiyorsunuz. Hikayenin gidişatıyla ilgili birkaç olay ve karakter olmaması, serinin devamını okumak konusunda soğuttu beni açıkçası.
I found this terribly boring. I had actually started reading this once before and never finished because it was too dull. Now I am dreading reading the next one because I think it will be painfully plodding.
DNF. Very strong beginning. Terribly booooring middle. Too much religious stuff. My time is too precious to be reading this crap when there’s a billion better books out there. #AintNobodyGotTimeFoDatMy GR friends were right.Life lesson: trust GR buddies’ ratings as they are good predictors of your own experience of a book. (Most of the time.)Orson Scott Card let me down this time. “Sad.” 🍊
I don't mind some Mormonism. I've read a lot of books I liked that were Mormon. But golly that was too much for me.
The novel starts with Alvin Miller – a father moving west with his family.
Don't let the rating suggest that this isn't an enjoyable book to read, it's just that when you get to the end, you realise that it was clearly written to set up the action that is (hopefully) coming in the later novels.I'd read this and Red Prophet back in the early nineties when I was at University, but having ordered the third book, Prentice Alvin recently, I realised that I had pretty much no recollection of the events of the first two books.
Dieses Kind, der siebte Sohn eines siebten Sohns, hat besondere Eigenschaften, und es gibt böse Kräfte, die verhindern wollen, dass dieses Kind je erwachsen wird...Ich liebe Alternativweltgeschichten, wenn sie gut gemacht sind: Es reicht meist ein minimaler Eingriff in unsere "echte" Geschichte, um die Welt, wie wir sie kennen, völlig zu verändern.
Handbewegungen können aufgeregte Ehemänner beruhigen, magische Zeichen das Böse vom Haus fernhalten und Elementarkräfte gegeneinander ausgespielt werden - und Religion kommt dann auch noch ins Spiel, als "aufklärerisches" Element gegen den "Aberglauben".Man muss sich darüber klar sein, dass diese Geschichte deutlich als Fortsetzungsroman ausgelegt ist.
Ne düşüneceğimi bilemiyorum. Kitabın en başından beri hikayede boşluklar olduğunu düşündüm. Belki çeviri yetersizdi veya beni tatmin etmedi, bilmiyorum. Üçlemenin ilk kitabı olduğundan, sadece düğümler atılmış gibiydi aynı zamanda. Tüm seriyi okuduğumda üç yıldızı hak etme konusunda fikrimin değişebileceğini düşünüyorum.Yine de rahat okunan ve fantastik bir kurguya sahip olsa da kolay anlaşılan bir kitap. Yedinci oğlun yedinci oğlu olan Genç Alvin ve meşale Peggy olağanüstü özelliklere sahip olan ilginç karakterler. Buna karşın kilise de oldukça aktif ve arada gerçeklik algım şaştı diyebilirim. İyi-kötü çatışmasının yansıtılış biçimini de etkileyici buldum. Ayrıca ben olağanüstü özelliklerin içinde bir gerçeklik metaforu da olduğunu hissediyorum.
Knowing I'm more of a book person than he is, he thought I'd like it.
I really liked the seventh son concept, that Alvin has magic, and I loved the idea of setting the story in an alternate American setting.
I loved Peggy's storyline so much, that she was able to see things that either were happening elsewhere or were going to happen.
I liked Alvin very much, but the story itself seemed to drag a bit and get bogged down in its own existential and philosophical conundrums.
This was the first book I ever read by Orson Scott Card.
It makes this novel and it's sequels among the most original fantasy novels I've ever read.
I totally identified with the main character Alvin and came to deeply care what happened to him.
Card's portrayal of the struggle between good and evil was also very interesting.
Still, Alvin's struggle against the Unmaker to me seems so, well, hopeless.
That's like waging a war against gravity or magnetism.
Still, really great book, one of my most favorite fantasy novels, and after reading this book OSC quickly became one of my favorite authors.
