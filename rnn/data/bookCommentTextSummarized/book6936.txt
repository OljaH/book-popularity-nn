i remember liking this book when i read it as a child, and i loved trumpet of the swan and charlotte's web like no other, so i just sense-memoried this into 4 stars.
and then there's this, about e.b. white: "He never stopped loving New York, calling it "a riddle in steel and stone," but he also prophetically saw the vulnerability of the city: "A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate millions...
rereading charlotte's web and trumpet of the swan was great - they can keep their five stars.
So I loved all the little contraptions and whatnot created to help Stuart function in a human-sized house.However, the book kind of felt like White didn't really know what he was doing with it or where he was going with it.
In any case, it's kind of bizarre.Also contributing to my sense that he didn't really know what he was doing with this story is the fact that, for the most part, aside from the fact that Stuart is a mouse born to a human family, everything is basically, well, reasonably plausible.
It didn't pack the emotional wallop that Charlotte's Web did, but it's still a fun, sweet story.Stuart Little was born only two inches high and he looked like a mouse, but luckily his parents and big brother loved him anyway.
At the end of the book Stuart sets off in a model car to find his friend the bird, who had flown away.
During the sailboat race, for example, White explains that the West Wind "had come halfway across America to get to Central Park." Or take the bird, Margalo, that Stuart befriends.
What's next?"Stuart Little was E.B. White's first children's book, published in 1945.
In fact, while the aspect of Stuart’s lineage is strange, it’s not presented as magical so much as just…maybe something that happens (as the book later presents the character of Harriet Ames, who is not a mouse born to regular-sized rich people, but a tiny but perfectly proportioned woman born to rich people).
Once Stuart gets his fill of the discussion he splits, heading back to his tiny yellow car and leaving the city for northern skies and perhaps, if he’s lucky, Margalo.But Stuart again, somewhat conveniently meets another man in the gutter, this time near Ames Crossing (in Connecticut, it seems).
Stuart Little is a children's novel from 1946, by Elwyn Brooks White, who was also the author of the more famous "Charlotte's Web".
He forms a friendship with a beautiful little white bird called Margalo, until to Stuart's dismay she disappears, to fly North.
If you enjoy gently humorous and whimsical tales with an old-fashioned feel and type of children's hero, you may enjoy this book, but it is not likely to appeal to a modern child, though it is written in an amusing, chatty style.
However, perhaps Stuart Little has now outgrown his quaint and rather twee beginnings.
This is the first book that ever blew my mind - by far my favorite children's novel.
One thing I look for in a book, I've realized, is a knockout ending - a book better have a good payoff.I don't want to spoil the ending here, but when my ten-year-old self got there, I couldn't believe it.
How could E.B. White leave it like that?
How can he leave so much unanswered?
I'm a sensitive, modern, secure man), and the last sentence may be my favorite in literature - better than "'Tis a far, far better thing I do...."
Excellent. How children's book should be. Lessons to be learned from an unlikely hero. Pure magic. Pure fun. Pure adventure. There was this scene where Stuart teaches a classroom full of kids; that was a touch of genius, pure gold. The ending was very whimsical, I liked it. No way its movie adaption could ever touch this fine work of art.
I'm just glad I didn't read this book as a child or the idea that Mrs Little gave birth to a mouse, and everyone thinks it's strange but perfectly natural, would've really freaked me out enough to ask my parents awkward questions.
I did not like two humans having a mouse baby. It does not seem to phase anybody else, though.
Almost as soon as the day he was born Stuart Little was asking for brandy and smokes.
Did Mrs. Little birth a grown man, ala http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr216H...
No, she birthed a mouse, apparently.
These are tall tales of a rather short stature, but that doesn't diminish their enjoyment.
B. White laid down a loosely connected collection of stories about a charming little guy in a big world, using size to some good comic effect through out.
On the downside, Stuart Little lacks the pathos and cohesiveness of White's most famous work, Charlotte's Web, and the ending trails off in a puff of cliff-hanging whimsy.
4 StarsThis book was good and kind of cute book to read. I have seen the movie and I thought it was a little bit better than the book surprisingly. I thought the writing was good and the story line though. Overall I thought it was a good book.
Cute quick read. I wish it had a more defined ending though.
this was a childhood favorite of mine and glad I introduced this story to my daughter when she was younger!

The narrative was a bit long and the overall feel of the book was rather old fashioned, but considering the story was originally published in 1945, it's easy to see why.
At least the final sentence of the story ends on a bright note (see quotes below.) We read this book in the span of a week and then followed it up by watching the 1999 movie and comparing the differences in the stories.
We also talked about how the original animated movie for Charlotte's Web more closely resembled the story.
I was probably 7 or 8 the first time I went through this one, and have doubtless read it through 10 times since. One of those timelessly classic children's stories you just always go back to. It just hearkens back to a simpler America; makes me think of hot summers and lemonade and tire swings and reading on the trampoline in the backyard.
I couldn't, I tried but couldn't add one more chapter after reading almost 50%.The characters are so hard to connect with, I loved Charlotte's web so so much but this one is a complete disaster for me.
The search for Margalo-- we'll never know...-My kids love it when I read this part very fast."Have you any sarsaparilla in your store?" asked Stuart.
Anything you want.""Let me have a bottle of sarsaparilla, please," said Stuart, "and a paper cup."-I read this book with 3-year-old Ellen right after we moved to Rochester.
I was feeling melancholy having just moved from a place and people I loved dearly.
Wow how different this book reads in 2017 and as an adult.It was surprising more than anything else.
overall I was not too impressed with Stuart Little the way I was as a kid.Also his "adventures" seemed rather boring.
Or maybe I am just too used to newer higher quality children's books like Harry Potter.The writing was abrupt and crass.
But it is not "timeless" the way some books are.
I could understand why it was great when it was written back in the 1940s but nowadays there is much better reading material for children.
Knowing this is the same author of Charlotte's Web, I expected more.
Stuart is born of human parents and for some reason he is a mouse.
Stuart goes sailing.
One day Margalo leaves the house toward the middle of the book and so Stuart runs away from home without saying goodbye to search for his bird friend.
The stories ends in the middle of the search.
B. didn't know how to end the story so he decided not to end the book.
The ending really bothers me and Stuart's attitude to his family bothers me.
Was anyone else freaked out by the fact that at the beginning of the story, a pair of humans, having already produced one human child, now bring forth a mouse?
And if we don't choose to go the route preferred by Marvel Comics, one would expect some sort of fantasy-related back-story.
At least in fairy-tales, people who have animal forms are generally under some sort of spell, and after a series of trials and tribulations, recover their humanity in the end.
Except that one of these people is a mouse.
My daughter and I read this out loud, chapter by chapter over the past two weeks. What a treat! I've never actually read the book, only seen the movie. I prefer the book. The movie I guess makes a more complete story, but I like the episodic nature of the chapters of the book. I also thought the writing was just magic. It was well written and Stuart is so well-spoken, and yet it was easy enough for my seven year old to read and enjoy.
Just a few things to note:I think I read this when I was a kid? But as an adult I was very surprised to discover that Stuart Little is more akin to a somewhat moody middle aged man than someone's little boy. Second, I liked reading this classic more than Charlottes Web and other E.B. White books I've read to the kids. White's voice is smooth and descriptive but still intelligent.
A New York City family unexpectedly has a mouse-child, and he discovers the unusual joys and challenges of life in the big world for a much smaller-than-average person. Listening to Julie Harris’s deft reading, I particularly enjoyed rediscovering the sailboat race and Stuart’s adventures on the road. Audiobook.
Enjoying rereading this timeless classic with my rising 3rd grader in these early summer days. I get something new out of a book like this every time. Williams's illustrations make me want to grab a canoe and hit the water. A perfect quick read aloud. 🐭
I loved Charlotte's Web and assumed Stuart Little would be just as awesome.
Whereas, Charlotte's Web stands the test of time and can truly be called a classic, I don't think Stuart Little would have been published today.
Stuart is born a mouse to a wealthy New York family.
The book is very episodic and disjointed however with very little cohesion to the plot.
All of these adventures make sense for the life of a two-inch mouse.
Then he gets an invisible car, teaches a class, meets a two inch girl for a horrible date and then continues his journey.
I first came across EB White when I read ‘Charlotte’s Web’ last year in a beautifully illustrated edition.
Continuing my journey across Children’s Literature, I picked up ‘Stuart Little’ wondering how I hadn’t read it before.
After all, I identify myself with a mouse!
‘Stuart Little’ is another adorable tale, although it doesn’t quite have the depth and poignancy of ‘Charlotte’s Web’.
But as with both the books, EB White touches upon ordinary values that are extraordinary to find these days - values of friendship, loyalty, sacrifice, and love.
Stuart is a cute little mouse, alright, scampering from one adventure to another.
Stuart's parents accept him, even though he is nothing like their other son; most friends and neighbors and strangers accept him, which makes this an almost-ideal world to live in.
And in this world of human giants, everything Stuart does is an adventure!Children's imaginations can create numerous endings or further adventures for Stuart, who at the end of the book, is on the road still searching for his friend Margalo - going north, because who knows what adventures may be found up north!
I think E.B. White was very clever to end the book without answering whether or not Stuart finds Margalo.
Forgive me, I'm in a maudlin mood today and had to post this.It all started here, folks, my love of stories.
I have vivid memories of my mother, God rest her loving soul, reading this book to me as a kid (funny, though I can't remember if my older sister and brother were present -- maybe they'd moved on to big kid books?).
I think I was 5 or 6 at the time.
I do love that mouse!Anyone care to mention their favorite childhood book, the one that made you fall in love with reading, I invite you to post it here.
reread this one recently and--while I am an adult now, and could fault it a star for lacking any sense of prose--I am smart enough to realize this is a children's book.
That means: it was written for children.That was when I read it: as a children.I loved it then, and I love it now.
It is not hard for me to see the magic here, or to get completely lost in the story of Stuart (especially the scene where his brother thinks he is dead, and goes running through the house pulling all the shades down).
