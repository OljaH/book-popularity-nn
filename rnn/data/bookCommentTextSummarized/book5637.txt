One of Richard Rodgers's and Oscar Hammerstein's majestic collaborations!
I played the King in eighth grade, but time hasn't made me more of a fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic.
Part of the trouble is the way they've written the King.
Out of all the Siamese characters, only he appears sometimes buffoonish and na√Øve in the way of the world.
Given how sympathetic and realistic the rest of the Siamese characters are, I don't see this as a case of racism, but merely as R&H trying to do too many things at the same time with a character who can't be everything to everyone.
The King and I is the story of widowed school teacher, Anna, and her son moving to Siam to teach the King's children and wives. Cultures collide in this beautifully written musical. The music alone is memorable. I loved it because of the differences between these cultures were brought forth, and I'm lenient towards drama.
I was ok with this movie as a child, but as an adult I just can't like it. As a modern woman, I just can't handle the ideas pushed in the narrative. But I give it two stars for the Uncle Toms Cabin scene which I always loved.
A fun show to perform or watch, although it's the Deborah Kerr/Yul Brenner film that sticks in my mind.
Crazy story now but back in the day, I loved the musical and so I read the play which lacks a lot without the music and the hunky actors.
An English widow and her children go to what is now Thailand to serve as a tutor for the children of the king.
