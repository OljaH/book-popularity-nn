Jack London died November of 1916 and these posthumously published stories were written during his final year of life.The opening title story is very fine indeed.
“The Water Baby” stands out for its remarkable and rather mystical approach to the clash of the old and new in Hawaiian culture.
“Shin Bones”is a rather grotesque piece and “The Tears of Ah Kim” is another story based on the clash of old and new.
The final piece, “The Kanaka Surf” has the makings of a fine story but takes too long to get to the point.London’s vivid and realistic technique make the collection absorbing and the wonderful title story is very moving.
2.5* Loved the first story which gives all the flavour of the Big Island and named so many places I know - lovely. The rest were okay - London writes well, his description is excellent, but these are not plot-driven stories,and feel a little lack-lustre as a result.
Halfway through, and thoroughly enjoying this history lesson of old Hawaii through London's tales. Defo a good read for anyone living in the aloha state with an interest in the past. Easy to find as a free download online.
This collection of stories was published after Jack London died and I bet if he had lived, then there would have been more adventure in each story.
Short stories about Hawaii. The book really captures the island nicely.
Here's a bunch of short stories that take place in post-Kingdom Hawaii, up until around the 1910s. There are love stories (tragic or not), adventure stories, and some comedy as well. I liked it.
