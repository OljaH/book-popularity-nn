I can't believe Patti Smith wrote a book about drinking black coffee and watching serial crime dramas and it's the best thing I've ever read.
It was filled with dreams, detective shows, talismans, cats, constant travels, coffee, more coffee, missing things, memories, loose threads, graveyards, hotels, photographs, and miles and miles of beautiful, lyrical Patti Smith prose.
In the end, Patti Smith made me cry.
She took these dreams and random memories, periods of loneliness and melancholia, artists and lost things and brought them together into a coherent love note to life, art, and love.
She stitched together ideas and travel and talismans of her life into a coherent and moving exploration of things, belief, and creativity.
I want to be Patti Smith when I grow up.
I listen to Patti Smith's audible.
As I was walking, I could picture Patti in the cafe she sat drinking coffee.
Easy or not ...I had a warm smile on my face listening to everything she had to say - at times aching -and soooo loving this woman.
There is a mystery about Patti Smith...
I'd like to own the physical book.....Take a copy of her book - sit in a cafe myself 'drinking' in her words...reading her lovely prose myself 'while' still hearing the sound of her voice in my ears.
Kinda really love this woman!
Sometimes the right book finds us at the right time.
For me this was the book.
Search for the perfect coffee, cafés, Hurricane Sandy, her obsession with detective shows and the way she enters into the lives of authors and novels.
At times her writing is poetic, at others very poignant, especially when thinking or remembering her husband, Fred and her children when they were young.
Her photography, travels, conferences and visits to author's graves, her likes and frustrations.
Not sure what others will think of this book, but for some reason it spoke to me.
Reading the lovely Proustian interlude that is M Train, I felt like a shadow-angel trailing Patti Smith, from Café 'Ino down the block from her New York apartment to the far-flung places in her past and present that twirl like ribbons in her poetry, her songs, her art.
This is a restful book—not a book about nothing as Smith suggests in its opening line—but a book about everything that makes a life: dishes, coats, cats, coffee, books, music, poetry, friendship, travel, love, loss.
Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch once said in an interview that if all culture breaks down, he's following Patti Smith.
Much of the pleasure of reading Smith's nostalgic M Train is that it offers fascinating insights into her interior life, her dreams, her quixotic travel adventures, her literary obsessions (listed in my Comment below), and her minimalist, bohemian tastes for such things as black coffee, brown bread with olive oil, Polaroids, word games, moleskines, detective stories, and her favorite black coat (lost).
(“I don’t like anything superfluous," she writes.) Smith's memoir will appeal to anyone with an appreciation for her rare personal aesthetics.
I saw another reviewer had listed all of the artists in a comment following his review and I want to copy this down and use as a part of my own “to-be-read” library list.Whether you are a Patti Smith fan or not, this is a very well written and very enjoyable book.
It's a relief and a joy, then, to follow the wide-eyed, childlike wonder that Patti Smith, in her late sixties, still has for reading, in this melancholy, peripatetic masterpiece about creativity and loss.
It will be a strong reader indeed who can walk away from this one without a list of further books to track down, and if you've ever wondered fleetingly whether some kind of real book could ever be made of your own scattered book reviews, travel diaries and journal entries, then this book shows that it can indeed be done, and succeed triumphantly.More to the point, she shows you how reading and writing works, as a form of mental wellbeing, of self-healing, of keeping an even keel in the world.
M-Train by Patti Smith is a collection of stories by the poet laureate of punk rock.
I have all her albums, seen her in concert, and own several of her books including number 86 of 100 of WIIT.
I waited a while to start this book wanting to hold on to the idea of a new Patti Smith book before risking disappointment.
I saw one review that talked about coffee and mentioned the word was mentioned forty-seven times.
Patti Smith does love her coffee.
Her stories are not so much exciting and with a twisting plot but more like catching up with an old friend over a ...
My 2nd audiobook and it was Patti Smith again... I just love listening to her. We are taken around the globe 🌎 in her memories and reflections of the past and I especially enjoyed the memories of her husband Fred Sonic Smith and her life here in Michigan.
But I grant that writers have a right to their muses and I empathize in my heart with her overall endeavor to master the art of conjuring up lost things and people, among them her dead father and brother and writers who feel like kin to her (e.g. Genet, Mishima, Plath).Having savored her award-winning memoir “Just Kids” about her youth in New York in the 60’s with her artist friend Mapplethorpe, I had already erased my sense of Patti Smith’s identity being that of a poetic pop singer.
So many pockets with so many treasures--stones, pens, leaves, tickets, a lost toy Fred Smith always liked to keep with him, a shred of one or another true cross.
I didn't get so much of a "jump up and make everybody read this" reaction to the book that I had with Just Kids, its more a difficulty shaking it off, like a dream that speaks to you so deeply, you can't just run around doing your thing the next day, you carry it around with you, turn it over in your palm at odd moments.
It's a pocketful of treasures, of things and times lost, that you want to handle and dream about.
And while these stories of her life are unique, intriguing and well written, they are quite scattered.As a fan of Patti Smith, especially after having read Just Kids I found myself enjoying this book immensely.
But people who may not feel the same way would perhaps find this book, well, pointless.While I didn't adore it as much as I was hoping, I still greatly appreciate how Patti Smith pushes me to see beauty in the world, record my experiences, lose things and let them go, and live artfully.
Either way, I was left wanting more, but still appreciative of the moments I had while reading this book.
"Just Kids" was an emotional tribute to a beautiful connection between two twin souls, Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe.
I didn't realize this while I was reading it either.What I did get from this book was a dreamlike meditation following an introverted and solipsistic Patti on her travels around the world.
In nearly every city she visits, she finds a cafe, where she imbibes her favorite drink, coffee, and sits and writes.
I could readily identify with her when she tells us she's lost the joy in her life since the death of her husband, guitarist Fred "Sonic" Smith in 1994.
He stops in the foyer, picks up a dart and throws it at a map of the world on the wall.
The idea being that he has the time and resources to travel anywhere at any time.
Well, that's Patti Smith, but instead of darts she uses random thoughts, or passages from books, or memories.
I traveled with her in this book and loved every minute.
Her writing mojo seems to match my reading mojo, so now I am really looking forward to reading her National Book Award winning "Just Kids".
"M Train" is perhaps one of the most romantic books of being a writer, and those who likes to read.
And speaking of Japan, I'm happy that she gives a call-out to my favorite cafe - "The Lion" in Shibuya, Tokyo.For those who fell in love with Patti Smith due to her previous book "Just Kids," will not find the same type of narrative.
In other words, this is a book that is hard to dislike, and one can only dislike this book, if you don't have the romantic impulse of reading and worshiping your favorite artists.
Writing this review is difficult because it's hard to explain in words the effect Patti Smith has on me.
In this book of shorts she shares with us memories from her travels, her family and what inspires her creativity.Her stories and stunning prose would be enough to make this a fantastic read for me, but her words always go well beyond that.
Every time I listen to her music, read her books, or see her in person she never fails to fill me with pure inspiration.
It’s a comforting book, in a way – like you’re in a mostly-empty coffee shop, sitting across from Patti Smith at a tiny table while you wait out the rainstorm, looking at her snapshots of Mexico and Japan and Russia, listening to her stories.
The fact that there’s no real purpose or resolution to the stories doesn’t really matter – it’s enough just to listen to Smith tell them.
On the morning of my birthday he told me he had no gift for me.-I don’t need a gift, I said.-But I want to give you something, whatever you wish for.-Then I would like your black coat, I said.
Hiçbir şey hakkında yazmak kolay değildir.
Böyle başlıyor söze bu kez Patti Smith.
Hiçbir şey; gittiği cafeler, ziyaret ettiği mezarlar, gördüğü rüyalar, hayalleri, polaroid makinasıyla çektiği siyah beyaz fotoğraflar..
Şairlerle gezginlerin bir tımarhanenin sadeliğini bulabileceği ufak bir sığınak.Çoluk Çocuk'tan farklı bir kitap bu, ama onun kadar lirik, iç acıtan bir anlatımı var.
Farkına varmadan hafif ama daimi bir keyifsizliğin içine sürükleniyorum.
Depresyon değil bu, daha çok melankoliye duyulan bir ilgi.
Nasıl oluyor da birine duyduğumuz sevgiyi onu ebediyen kaybedinceye değin bir türlü bütünüyle anlayamıyoruz?
Patti Smith kitabında cansız nesnelerle ve ölülerle konuşuyor.
yüzyılın çılgınlığına direnen bir çiçek çocuk, bilge ruh.
Η Patti Smith ( η οποία μπορεί να κάνει ποίηση ακόμα και τα ψώνια στο σούπερ μάρκετ) πίνει black coffee, ταΐζει τις γάτες της, μηρυκαζει τον κόσμο κ συνομιλεί με τα φαντάσματα του παρελθόντος, του παρόντος κ του μέλλοντος.Κ η πρόζα της είναι απλά υπέροχη, όπου και αν την έχω πετύχει
Slightly more than one year ago, the beginning of June, I read Patti Smith’s  Just Kids  and I fell in love with the writing, the story of her early years with Robert Mapplethorpe and then later on her music career, and her marriage to Fred “Sonic” Smith. ”It’s not so easy writing about nothing. “That’s what a cowpoke was saying as I entered the frame of a dream. Vaguely handsome, intensely laconic, he was balancing on a folding chair, leaning backwards, his Stetson brushing the edge of the dun-
and I fell in love with the writing, the story of her early years with Robert Mapplethorpe and then later on her music career, and her marriage to Fred “Sonic” Smith.
Entering the mind of Patti Smith, her dreams, her thoughts, her outlook on life, on art and other artists, the art of living a true life, a good life, is what had me reading this first as a book, and then listening to the Audible version of what I’d just read just so I could have the pleasure of hearing it with her inflections, her pauses, her voice.
‘I’m sure I could write endlessly about nothing. If only I had nothing to say.’ Patti Smith carries us through her esoteric stories of the past and present in this short story/essay collection. M Train reads like an internal journey, a solo exploration. She recalls cafes visited all around the world, writing or simply sitting and reminiscing while drinking an insane amount of coffee that makes my own addiction to caffeine seem laughable. While Smith seems completely content with her own company
Patti Smith carries us through her esoteric stories of the past and present in this short story/essay collection.
Random, non-cohesive thoughts that bounce around her lifetime from past to present with no indication of time.
It is possible for randomness to possess interest and there is no doubt that Patti Smith has led a most interesting life, such as the descriptions of her trip to Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in northwest French Guiana to visit the remains of a French penal colony where criminals were kept.
While her writing is still top-notch and her talent is undeniable, M Train was simply too meandering and tangential for my liking.
While it is perhaps a cliché to call such a book 'dream-like,’ M Train truly moves with the logic of dreams, and Smith gives equal consideration to her dreams as she does to her waking experience.
But what makes M Train feel most like a dream is its slippery, mystical relationship to time.
Smith is all too aware that much of what gets lost is irreplaceable: 'Please stay forever, I say to the things I know.
Don’t grow.’ The journey of M Train through Smith’s ‘stuff,’ we come to understand, is itself an incantation of this plea." —Sara Jaffe, San Francisco Chronicle
Η καθημερινή της ρουτίνα μου δημιούργησε ένα αίσθημα ζεστασιάς και οικειότητας και μία τρομερή διάθεση για καφέ (όσοι το διαβάσουν θα καταλάβουν).Ωστόσο άλλο ήταν το στοιχείο που με έκανε να αγαπήσω αυτό το βιβλίο.
Δεν είμαι σίγουρη αν ο τρόπος που το εξηγώ είναι ξεκάθαρος αλλά αυτό ακριβώς το στοιχείο είναι που με έκανε να αγαπήσω το M Train.
Μου ξαναθύμισε πόσο σημαντικό είναι να κάθεσαι και να σκέφτεσαι, να παιδεύεις το μυαλό σου με μία ιδέα , με μία λεπτομέρεια μέχρι να μπεις στο μεδούλι της, να την κάνεις κτήμα σου και να λειτουργήσει τελικά ως αφορμή για να κάνεις τέχνη.
Καφές,όνειρα,ταξίδια, καφές,βιβλία,φαντάσματα αγαπημένων προσώπων,φαντάσματα αγαπημένων συγγραφέων,κι άλλος καφές,τηλεοπτικές σειρές,γάτες,νεκροταφεία,πολλές φωτογραφίες και...καφές!Αυτά είναι μερικά απο τα συστατικά αυτού του πολύ όμορφου μελαγχολικού βιβλίου απο την αγαπημένη Πάτι Σμιθ.Της Πάτι που αγαπάει τον Μουρακάμι,τις βόλτες στην παραλία,τα καφέ,που μπορεί να κάνει ένα ολόκληρο ταξιδι για να επισκεφθεί τον τάφο ενός συγγραφέα,που της λείπει ο άντρας της,που μοιράζεται μαζί μας τις αναμνήσεις της και που πολύ με συγκίνησε για άλλη μια φορά με την υπέροχη γραφή της.
Patti Smith is precious.
She's that person that elides all these categories revealing possibilities that eschew the usual "she's this or that".
Patti Smith is this and that, and many other things besides.
More importantly, she's this and that (girl but also tomboy, woman but also an androgynous person) without being someome out there that has nothing to do with us.
Patti Smith is all those possibilities within us (although she's her own person out there as well).
The book was a bit stream of consciousness and flowy, so you'll like it if you'te in that sort of thing.
She has always been a fascinating figure to me, so when I saw this audio book available at my local library, I put a hold on it, because I wanted to learn more about her and her life.
There, everything I learned is right here in these few sentences-but I wanted MORE.This was well written and I did enjoy Patti reading it to me herself.
I will most likely try something else, probably Just Kids, and see what I can learn from that.
Recommended for readers that already know and like Patti Smith.
Patti Smith wrote: “It’s not so easy writing about nothing” and I thought, ok, it’s going to be not easy to read about nothing … Her stories, however, not about nothing. As Patti Smith says, this book is ,,a roadmap to my life”. I'm truly enjoyed hers stories.  One more thing! I listened to this book and what a drug is her voice! Highly recommend an audio version!
I read "Just Kids" and thought, "Wow, this is amazing! Why am I not a huge Patti Smith fan?" Then I read "M Train" and realized, "Oh yeah. Now I remember."
