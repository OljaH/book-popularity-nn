Reed is the sort of impish satirical crank whose Promethean intellect and restlessly zesty creativity tingles my funnybones, but whose books always leave me yearning for more logic, understanding and clarity.
More to the point: the references of whatever African-African late 60s cultural moment under analysis are entirely lost on a 26-year-old whitey from Backwoods, Scotchland, so the book deserves a more clued-in reader.
In terms of the language, Reed has dropped the wizardry from his first two books Yellow Radio and Freelance Pallbearers, which is a shame, because his skill in that regard is nonpareil.
Dionysian counter=punch to the Apollonian order enjoyed by all Atonists.
It swings!
To say we have it coming is an understatement.
I had it coming, what with after all that faith=in=fiction mumbo jumbo I was jiving upon reading my Mano Mano Mano.
Makes no difference what I say.
Jes Grew is upon you.
You know I’ll tell history different.
Besides, Osiris is no more dead or alive than Odin and Zeus ; and ancient Egypt still makes for great fiction, and fiction --- fiction is where it’s at.
You know what Emma says about revolutions and dancing?
Yeah, it’s like that.
While I'm sure we're not meant to take it as literal truth, with 1000 year old white Knights Templar plotting in a grand conspiracy to keep the black man down because of the danger inherent in his dance, there's certainly plenty of fair criticism of:-art institutes as a form of cultural piracy, -patronizing patrons who damn with faint praise, -generational disconnect that prevents the youth from learning from the legacy of their elders, -white America's contempt for Haiti and ignorance of its history, -wishy-washy white do-gooders whose sympathy is suspect and unreliable,-the indoctrination of some black folks to have contempt for their own race once they've been given a chance to rise one or two steps above their brethren, -and the hypocrisy of belittling native Afro-Caribbean spiritualism in favor of the white man's goofy Bible or Quran, as though those religious traditions were less "primitive" for the virtue of having been blessed by contact with Western Culture.So, okay, there you have it.
So I guess it's a good thing that I ended up rather enjoying this light-hearted romp.Taking place in Prohibition-era New York City, Ishmael Reed's Mumbo Jumbo charts the rise of ragtime and jazz as an infectious thought meme of liberation and fertility called Jes Grew beating its tattoo of freedom from hierarchical society straight from the heart of ancient Egypt.
I see now why James had so thoughtfully underlined many of his favorite passages, it's a great book to quote in conversation and one that I've found myself thinking about quite often in the days since finishing it.
Some great, witty, justifiably angry writing here, and some wonderful use of fragmentation and sampling but somehow it never cohered for me and, at times, I did actually find my interest waning a little, which is not a good sign for such a short book...
Ishmael Reed takes a lot of Pynchonian ideas (massive conspiracy theory, fundamental novelty) and puts a distinct Afro-futurist spin on them, and the result is phenomenal. What makes "Mumbo Jumbo" unique is its remarkable merger of formal experiment (incorporation of visual material, novel typography, freewheeling plot structure) and sheer enjoyment. I've never had more fun demanding the downfall of static white society.
A challenging and jubilatory postmodern (re)vision of the mythical powers that be, MJ is a short but intense ride through the underbelly of the jousting hidden forces shaping history, religion, culture, and race relations, and it all comes to a head in the jazzy arena of 1920's Harlem:  After a first flair-up in 1890's New Orleans, HooDoo/Voodoo forces are once again alive and on the rise as Jes Grew, the 'psychic virus' spreads and infects its carriers with the irresistable urge to jam, dance, and otherwise just get funky.
For various and sundry reasons, it took me over twenty years after finding out about it to read this book.
If I could find Mr. Reed's contact info, I'd write him; the book will foster loads of questions.
If you have read it, I suggest you check out any of Kip Hanrahan's CONJURE recordings, in which a stunning variety of black musicians (Allen Touissaint, Alvin Youngblood Hart, David Murray...that ain't close to all) bring many of the elements of MUMBO JUMBO to life, often with Mr. Reed reading over them.
These recordings may be hard to find in hard copy form.
The writing in here is impressive on a language level, and it is definitely thought provoking at the same time that it's entertaining. I had a bit of an easier time with this one than The Free-Lance Pallbearers. That, of course, doesn't speak to the quality of the work or how interesting it is, just how approachable it was for me. Both books make me intrigued about Ishmael Reed as a writer and I'll definitely pick up something else of his at some point. A very skilled writer with significant things to say.
Another one of those life-altering books. Takes two of my favorite things, satire and history, and completely turned it on its head. I don't know what kind of writer I'd be without Ishmael Reed.
"Time is a pendulum. Not a river. More akin to what goes around comes around." Mumbo Jumbo be our current politic or realpolitik and Jes Grew and it Templars still banging in da streets all over dis land, lordy we gots troubles many don't kid yerselves shit going down. Da pendulum done swung and we swamped like this here book will eat yer lunch and spit it out. Readit and weep. Out ya'll.
Thomas Pynchon's freewheeling narrator of  Gravity's Rainbow  (1973) tells us, "Well, and keep in mind where those Masonic Mysteries came from in the first place. (Check out Ishmael Reed. He knows more about it than you will ever find here.)" Similarly, the underground cult classic compendium of conspiracy, Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's Illuminatus! Trilogy (an important influence on both Alan Moore and Grant Morrison) opens with this epigraph from Ishmael Reed's 1972 novel, Mumbo Jumbo:
Similarly, the novel also bears a significant subplot about a group of art "thieves" who strive to liberate the works of the global East and South from Europe's and America's museums; in his portrait of this multicultural group, Reed charts some of the fissures and fractures among people of color, noting that, for instance, a common enemy in European empire does not necessarily make for frictionless comity between black and Asian peoples.Against Jes Grew's supporters is the Wallflower Order, who are in their time of Jazz Age extremity forced to call in white intellectual and ageless Knight Templar Hinckle von Hampton (Reed's satire on white Harlem Renaissance impresario Carl Van Vechten), who plans to defeat black insurgency by coopting it.

Here is the template for Conspiracy Operas like Illuminatus! and Foucault's Pendulum. A fast, funny, poetic read that offers yet another parable for the Way Things Work Behind the Scene. This is the novel that set the pace. The idea of Jes Grew is so convincing that I think I may have been stricken with it. That's all- gone muggin'.
WM1: E' il libro pi� famoso dello scrittore afro-americano Ishmael Reed, pubblicato negli USA nel 1972, gi� arrivato in Italia parecchi anni fa in una traduzione che ne snaturava lo stile e i contenuti.
E' un Hard-boiled mistico che si svolge a Harlem negli anni Venti - l'epoca della Black Renaissance - e ha come protagonista un detective animista, Papa LaBas, alle prese con un complotto massonico-templare e con l'epidemia di Jes Grew (virus diffuso tramite il jazz che spinge i bianchi a ballare fino allo sfinimento).
Mumbo Jumbo combines mystery, history, citation, and photography into a single novel about the conflict between Eastern (Black) and Western (White) Civilization.
Jes Grew comes in the form of music and dancing and is what the Wallflower Order wants the black community to eliminate by way of conforming to white society instead of allowing it to mix in with the melting pot (these eugenically inflected terms are apropos).
Reed's grand vision, then, is to depict the Bible as a black text appropriated by whites, which also works to depict how Western civilization is a failed attempt to keep black culture at bay.
Mumbo jumbo is Reed's reminiscence of slavery's clusterfuck; when the passing back and forth of peoples and cultures, European, African, Creole, Voodoo, high yellow and Christian, violent, pastoral, democratic, authoritarian .
Into this milieu, and to parody DuBois, came the Reformer, the school-marm, First (Radical) Reconstruction, Douglass's narrative is a harbinger of the trickster, Sandy Jenkins' "brew," his root, gonna save Douglass's ass, only it provides rather a key to "reading" the slave system's code as an "outside": the Christian ethos of authoritarian casuistry: Jes Grew.
Mumbo Jumbo es un libro original y exótico.
Con mucha gracia: hay espíritus que poseen cuerpos y piensas que son malos pero luego son realmente buenos; hay caballeros templarios que le besan el culo a Baphomet; hay nuevas interpretaciones de historias del Antiguo Testamento; hay serias denuncias contra la política exterior de los EEUU de la época.¿Y a quién le puede gustar este libro?
I'm planning on updating my review post book club meeting next week.
Maybe my fellow readers can shed some light on Mumbo Jumbo for me.I had a tough time discerning what was based on historical fact and what was fictional.
But the book does jump from Greek mythology to Haitian tales to Christian stories - so maybe time is rather loosely based?
Then several chapters later there is a reference to an android being a metallic robot - the definition I'm accustomed to.
In Mumbo Jumbo, is an android a person?
By the time you finish the book you feel good about where you are versus where you started, and it makes you want to look back at the beginning to see how much more of it you get now.Reed is an important author, he's got a strange style but really cuts deep into some tough to tackle issues like race and prejudice, even how he sees himself.His books are probably best read in a group or class so you can discuss, and make sure you're getting all the various references, and think about what he might mean.
Part alternate world fantasy, part meta-critique of the aesthetic values of Western Civilization, Mumbo Jumbo is probably best understood as an evocation, a Working, to use the book’s own vernacular, mockingly(?) supposing itself to herald or call forth a leveling of the white power structure and the birth of a new, multicultural age.
There’s so much great stuff in here that the missteps, in particular an abrupt third act switch in the narrative style, are particularly frustrating, but even still anyone reading it will come away with the certainty that Reed is an absolute original.
A breath-stealing, rip-roaring romp through an alternate-universe 1920s where HooDoo detectives and militant museum-robbers mingle with shady masonic organisations and small-time crooks.
Jazz and blues meet mainstream media, and Haitian spirits clash with '20s New York, as the spontaneous, homemade, and utterly infectious spirit of Black American creativity, Jes' Grew, sweeps the land.Okay, so Ishmael Reed has his problems - he can't write women, for a start - but this book is something special all the same.
It's a rambling, thrilling rant of a novel, lampooning the detective genre and historical novel even as it makes deft use of their established conventions.
Quite a wonderful novel; perhaps not perfect, but wildly imaginative and inspiring.
Yeah, sure, as far as post-mo goes: there's a crapload of characters, references, occultism, images, playing with tradition, narrative breaks, quotes; at first it's hard to know what goes on, yet as soon as you become more acquainted with the cartoonish characters and their motivations it reads quite engagingly.
The whole part about the roots of Jes Grew, in particular, is just excellent, and as a reader I'm compelled to read more about some subjects mentioned.
And on top of it, it's funny.Be sure to read whilst listening to Funkadelic or Max Roach.
What a tasty gumbo MUMBO JUMBO by Ishmael Reed is!
It’s so thick I’m tempted to eat it with a fork, but I’m going a use a spoon, so I can get every last drop!
It’s chock full of story, images, excepts, news items, memos, letters, history, mystery, myth, all glued together with hoodoo, which is to say magic.
It reads like John Dos Passos’ USA TRILOGY, with its kaleidoscopic collage technique, but it’s a lot funkier and funnier.
Who says you can’t laugh at white supremacy?
This is the history of a race that has had its history erased.
It should be required reading.
un giallo vudù? un libro di black fantasy? una satira della harlem degli anni '20? una critica delle politiche diffuse nella popolazione afroamericana? un'anticipazione della mentalità p-funk di george clinton & c.? "mumbo jumbo" è tutto questo, e anche di più. è un u.f.o. letterario, qualcosa che non ha paragoni, che vive in una dimensione e un genere tutto suo, un'opera di puro genio. probabilmente uno dei più clamorosi libri di culto (in ogni senso....) di sempre. pazzesco che sia così poco noto...
Reed's sweeping neo-hoodoo detective story incorporates history, mythology, folklore, pop culture, politics, & philosophy. The vernacular of the text is both engaging and dizzying. Characters sometimes come off as two-dimensional, but the flatness fits the mythological range of the narrative. A smart, funny book that never takes its reader for granted, but also sometimes gets a little mired in its own language and cleverness, although it thankfully avoids ever becoming precious or trite.
Published in 1972 but set in the 1920s it's one of the best novels of Ismael's 50-year writing career and is written in a free stying jazz style to match the jazz era it brings to life. Photographs, newspaper cuttings, handwritten notes and footnotes all feature throughout. The style is sometimes hard to follow, sometimes frustrating but in the end, it's rewarding and leaves you feeling slightly inebriated. Mumbo Jumbo is a work of slightly absurd and unfettered imagination.
Una novela delirante pero al mismo tiempo muy elaborada. Pynchon es reediano. Lo que no tengo claro es la relación con Coover e, incluso, con el Roth de la época de Nuestra pandilla... ¿todos los escritores blancos querían ser Reed?En fin, es cierto que Homero no menciona a Dionisos en la Iliada, pero Reed no menciona a Orfeo. Es importante :-)Aquí más:Mumbo Jumbo
Ordinarily I am not a regular reader of fiction, however this literary classic is most definitely worthy of note. Reed spins a fascinating tale of the enchanting world of Hoodoo and Voodoo. Mumbo Jumbo is the real deal, it takes mystical subject matter and weaves it into a surrealistic novel revolving around Afro-diasporan religion.
Never has a novel been gifted a more appropriate title. For me, it's like the work of William Burroughs: important, perhaps, but hardly enjoyable.
