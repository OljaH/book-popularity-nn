The book Mathilukal (Meaning : Walls ) is autobiographical and was made into a very famous movie by Adoor Gopalakrishnan.Confined to the narrow space of a prison cell, the pratagonist falls in love with a woman in the neighbouring prison compound. They are separated by a high wall build to seperate prison compound. The man and woman never see each other throughout. It is a brilliant work by a genious.
I saw the movie.
Unbelievable work. I highly suggest you Wikipedia the author.
