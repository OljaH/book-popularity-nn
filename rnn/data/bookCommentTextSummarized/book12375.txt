oh man, this book totally tricked me!
I had just watched a show on A&E about WWII naval battles so I couldn't WAIT to read Watership Down!
I love sea stories, "man overboard!" and "off the port bow!" and "aye aye cap'n!" all that stuff so I pulled my hat down and started reading.
Bigwig is the man!
The rabbit man.
You should read it.
This book totally tricked me.

********************* SPOILER ALERT!!!****************** This book has no ships, sinking or otherwise.********************************************************
I don’t give a shit what Richard Adams says about his book because it simply isn’t true.
Moreover, the novel questions the artificial life that captive animals must endure and demonstrates that they should be at one with their true nature like the rabbits of this novel.
I’m sounding like a little bit of a misanthrope but, again, it’s true.
“Men will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals.”Regardless of what Richard Adams thinks; his book is an allegory for many things.
Re-read on audio is great.
I can't believe it has taken me all of these years to read this book!
It was such a wonderful book.
I loved getting lost in this world of rabbits, where they talked of their fears, of things they needed to get done, the great camaraderie between each and every one of them.
to a time of childhood and great things.
I would recommend this book to anyone that hasn't read it yet.
I'm not sure if I would let small children read or watch this movie since it's rather gory and sad things.
Hazel finds out he is a natural leader and through courage, luck, and Macguveresque skills manages to bring his troop through the thickets of a new and dangerous world.
I was convinced I was reading a book about rabbits not rabbits with human faces.
Cleverness was a revered trait among warren colonies and is reflected in their stories of past accomplishments by legendary rabbits.
At about page 70 I could feel my eyes looking over with longing at the stack of books waiting in the wings.
Throughout the book you feel that Hazel is the natural-born leader of his group of rabbits, but Richard Adams was very careful to develop this impression through character features rather than power-relations.
Finally, the thing that brings all these features together and makes the book more than a mere story, or an account of human characters, or a diatribe against fascism, is the fact that Adams is quite conscious of the fact that he is telling the story from the perspective of rabbits.
I suppose the book can be seen as a cultural study of an imaginatively rich but realistic rabbit world.
Maybe 40 years ago the first time.Lots of authors have written animal stories but they tend to be cute little tales where the level of anthropomorphism is such that the rabbits or whatever are practically, or literally, wearing waistcoats and top hats.
When Adams' rabbits come into contact with humans we get a true sense of incomprehension, of struggling to make sense of their activities (and technology) within the framework of a very different world view.Watership Down is a fat book containing a lot of story.
I started this book about 2 months ago, got through the first 10 pages or so and I was not interested in continuing.
[image error]Alright, so these bunnies are not your cutsie Japanese anime bunnies.
Picture the Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python: that would probably be closer to the mark than Thumper from Bambi.[image error]Joking and random pictures aside, I thought this was excellent.
There was a lot more depth to this book than I ever expected.
I don’t know how anyone could read this book and NOT fall in love with Bigwig aka Thlayli.
I would like to convince people who feel averse to reading a novel for children about rabbits to drop their preconception and give this book a chance.
There are hair raising chase scenes, espionage scenes, interspecies alliances, and a bloody fight scene that should be read with Survivor’s "Eye of the Tiger" playing in the background.Again credit LadyFisziOn the characterisation side it is worth noting that the rabbits in this book are not anthropomorphized animals, they do not wear clothes, drive cars, watch TV etc.
You can even gloss over them without missing a beat of the book.Reading this book is a little like taking a magic potion and transforming into a wee rabbit.
In memory of Richard Adams (1920 - 2016):-------Some books have an amazingly unexplainable ability to transcend the purpose of their creation and take a leap into being an instant timeless classic. “All the world will be your enemy, Prince of a Thousand enemies. And when they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you; digger, listener, runner, Prince with the swift warning. Be cunning, and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.” Watership Down began as an imp
It is a story full of palpable love for English countryside, full of 'rabbity' allegories of the variations of human societies and ideologies that nevertheless do not overshadow the simple but fascinating impact of the story of survival against all odds, rooted in friendship, bravery, loyalty, courage, quick thinking and learning, ability to see and embrace the new while relying on the ages-tested old, and perseverance despite the unfavorable odds.
The parallels between Hazel and the legendary rabbit folklore hero, El-ahrairah, the Prince of a Thousand enemies, are not surprising, and the final scene of the book, lovely but quietly gut-wrenching, comes as no surprise.
Be cunning, and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.This is my all time favorite book...although some of my love for this book may be an emotional attachment to the time in my life when it was read for the first time.
Before this book, my parents used to read to me at bedtime on my own...Eloise, Paddington Bear, and eventually Harriet the Spy..but then one magical day, my dad picked a book that he thought would suit the whole family...WATERSHIP DOWN.
I think there are generally two classes of people when it comes to this book: those who see beyond the surface and love it, and those who just don't get it and wonder how anyone can praise a silly book about talking rabbits.Given my rating of it, I obviously fall into the former group.
On the surface this is an engaging tale about a group of outcast rabbits who leave their warren at the promptings of one of their fellows who is able to foresee a great catastrophe on the horizon.
Yet if you then asked, "So is it a children's book?" the answer would be a firm "No!" It includes explicit details about warrens being gassed, rabbits snagged in barbed wire, about torture under a totalitarian regime, and descriptions of savage and bloody conflict.From the first paragraph onwards, the style of writing indicates its focus group.
The broad story-line of Watership Down concerns a small, ever-changing group of rabbits, led by Hazel and his little brother Fiver, in an attempt to escape their warren.
(view spoiler)[At the end of the novel, Hazel dies, and just after he has left his body, he looks back at his warren, seeing his home, the community he established, with many rabbits running and playing and enjoying themselves (hide spoiler)].
In “Watership Down”, Hazel and the other rabbits have to figure out who they want leading them, whom they trust, what they want their home to be like, and what they're willing to sacrifice in order to make their world the way they want it to be.
"What sort of world do I want to live in?", is the question that Hazel and his rabbits ask themselves when they go out to start a new home.
Few human characters that I have read in recent books can compare in depth and dimension to the rabbits of Watership Down.
It's not an overly sad ending to be honest, however, I cried because author Richard Adams ends his book with the passing of life.
The relatively long life of one of the rabbits depicted here is shown coming to an end and that shit gets me every time (ie Bilbo as he passes on to the Grey Havens...friggin' hell, I've got something in my eye).
It makes me think of living out a long, beautiful life with my wife and then eventually having to say goodbye to her for the final time as we pass away.
I know the person it happened to quite well, though I have changed names and other particulars in order to protect the innocent and not-so-innocent.So, many years ago, my friend (let's call her Mary) used to have a dog (let's call him Rover).
She lived next door to a family whose five year old girl (let's call her Anna) had a rabbit (let's call him Fluffy).
Anna was extremely fond of Fluffy, and spent a lot time playing with him, feeding him lettuce, and doing other stuff five year old girls do with their pet rabbits.One weekend, Anna's family were going off for a day to visit relatives.

It's one of the best books I've ever read."
Watership Down is a classic fantasy novel, written in 1972, that originated in stories told by Richard Adams to his daughters on long car drives.
They have various adventures along the way to a new home on the top of Watership Down, then more adventures as they somewhat belatedly realize that, whoops, they need some female rabbits to have a viable new warren.
Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and the gang may be taking on more than they can handle!The actual Watership Down, in EnglandOn its surface this is a semi-realistic story about the lives of wild rabbits (you know, if rabbits could talk to each other using words) but, in the way of most good books, it's about universal truths, and about human concerns as much as animal ones.
It should be noted that there were some friends who shared my less than awesome view of the book whose opinions I also respect (maybe even more now…;-)) but there was this nagging feeling that I missed something… What I liked About it… I listened to the Audible version narrated by Ralph Cosham.
Maybe some of the female writers were (to use a rabbit analogy) too busy breaking free from the patriarchal warrens and trying to have a rich fulfilling life of eating grass and making kittens by their choice aka combating extreme sexism and the males too busy fighting senseless wars determining who the biggest, strongest rabbit is and running from the ravages of mankind and controlling female rabbits aka committing it (sexism) .
And its low intensity---so much lower than that of daylight---makes us conscious that it is something added to the down, to give it, for only a little time, a singular and marvelous quality that we should admire while we can, for soon it will be gone again."Watership Down follows the story of a group of rabbits who are in search of a new home after they escape the destruction of their warren.Let's provide some background to my Watership Down reading experience - I've never seen the movie, never read the book before, so I honestly had no idea what to expect.
"I announce with trembling pleasure the appearance of a great story." In 1972, an unknown British novelist named Richard Adams published his debut novel with a rather misleading title, Watership Down. After being rejected 13 times by various publisher it was finally accepted by Rex Collings, a one-man company which worked on a shoestring and couldn't pay Adams any advance, but had important connections in the London literary scene and made sure that it was read by everyone who mattered. Rex Col
Before Rex Collings decided to give it a try, Richard Adams experienced plenty of frustration with explaining that he didn't even had children in mind and that Watership Down was really about Hazel & Fiver and their rabbits, a book which anyone, young or old, could buy and enjoy, and that the age group of his audience could roughly be contained between 8 and 88.
The stories of El-ahrairah and his adventures are sprinkled throughout the main narrative, and serve as inspiration and entertainment for the rabbits, and as a way to find courage in hard times.A reviewer in the New Statesman praised Richard Adams for writing a big, tense, picaresque story; these three adjectives probably best describe Watership Down.
Watership Down is a modern classic that has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.Watership Down is 
Actually, I do not give this book a 5.
This book is a classic for a reason.
Read it, buy it, read it to your children, give it to your children...
Seriously, if you have not read this book yet, READ IT NOW.
It is also about bravery, warlords, leadership, sacrifice, adventures, spies, friendship, rescue missions and so much more.
This is not the first time I've read this book and it certainly won't be the last.
Don't miss out on this stunning adventure!ETA: Older children.
Not small children.
Perhaps 10, 11, 12 range or even older.
The book is brutal and contains violence and ...
I'm 100 pages in, and this book is as boring as they come.
Do books become classics because they are boring and someone has decided that it's a mark of high class to read boring books?
Every person brings in different experiences that allows a book to speak to them in a different way.
If we all liked the same things, the world would be a terribly boring place.
My one star is personal and has little to do with the author's ability to write or others' possibility of liking it.
I had started this before but shelved it for more than 8 years!
Worth the wait?Now, without that adolescent sense of awe, I do not share Donnie Darko's fascination with it (though Joy Division for sure will never go out of style).
Yes, because I associate it with my formative (hellish) years, I think I made a bigger deal about getting through this than I should have.
As a reader you feel for the critters & their warren seems like an example of true asexual intimacy.But what does it all mean?
for the reader to contend with, bottom line.
It's easy to suggest that humans are degrading their environment, harder to say what should be done about it given that we are all complicit in it - and Adams makes no effort at all in that direction.Little did I suspect that this was just the pre-amble to a tremendous adventure in which this theme would be dropped almost entirely and the focus would shift toward questions of leadership, governance and the will to power.
One method adopted by Adams is to remember that they are rabbits, not just metamorphosed humans, which one might think would be counter-productive but turns out not to be.
And its low intensity---so much lower than that of daylight---makes us conscious that it is something added to the down, to give it, for only a little time, a singular and marvelous quality that we should admire while we can, for soon it will be gone again.In closing, I share a couple of quotes that highlight the wonder of Adams’ ability to foster thoughts in the reader about the similarities and difference between and within our species:Rabbits live close to death and when death comes closer than usual, thinking about survival leaves little room for anything else.Rabbits (says Mr. Lockley) are like human beings in many ways.
(Anyone with a pulse and a beating heart that gives a shit about what is around them.) There's a lovely intro in a newer edition about how he "wrote" it with his children (the stories started out a spur-of-the-moment thing when prompted to tell them a story).
One of the many things that Watership Down is about is the right to live with dignity.
Maybe I feel it is meant to take away dignity from those rabbits.
Put a genus tag on the book and file it away for the past.Maybe it's the feeling of wonder before cynicism can kick in.
So, yeah.Rabbits going gung-ho in England and encountering many different politics, talking about mythology, death, and courage.
Oh, yeah, and if you didn't pick up on that bit...
They can't count to five but they have complex Briar-Rabbit mythologies.
Oh, and there's a bit of a Cassandra precog stuff and ghosts, too.
But don't let this next bit bring you down!
It's rabbits, ya'll.
Have you told your little ones about where the meat they're eating comes from?
Kids aren't dumb.
Most of them aren't.
:)All told, this really IS a classic.
It's a subversive, political, adventuresome survival dystopia with delightful bunnies.Marlon Bundo eat your heart out.
And the reason is that the story is compelling and well-written and so real that you can smell the grass on Watership Down and feel the heat of the summer sun.One of my favorite things about the novel was Adams’ use of epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter.
Starting with the Alphapets books that helped teach me to read and carrying on into the worlds of Narnia and Redwall, many of my favorite literary animals were pretty much people with fur and tails.
A book like this one deserves a review and so here I am writing one for this.When I started reading this book, the talking rabbits seems weird and was very near to stop reading but at that time I was on my way to see my newly born niece.
so nothing else to do for one hour I kept reading this book and absolutely fell in love with these cute little rabbits and their story of survival.
this book tells us the story of a group of rabbits who left their own colony after Fiver got an intuition that something bad was about to happen.
