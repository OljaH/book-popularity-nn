well, she got seven months, at least. my beloved maggie succumbed to her cancer last night. going dark for a bit to mourn the best cat i ever knew. so, it turns out my baby has the cancer. and, like the girl in this book, she's been given six months. but what i learned from this book (no spoiler warning needed since the fact that this thing has sequels spoils it for you already), is that six months can easily turn into years if you drink enough watermelon milkshakes and have a plucky attitude.i
and, like the girl in this book, she's been given six months.
but what i learned from this book (no spoiler warning needed since the fact that this thing has sequels spoils it for you already), is that six months can easily turn into years if you drink enough watermelon milkshakes and have a plucky attitude.i mean, look at her - does this look like a cat with six months to live?
from it, i learned that cancer can be cured with a watermelon milkshake and a positive attitude, which i think is still medically accurate.
My best friend read this when we were 12 and bought me a copy at her school library book sale.
In hindsight, it really is a wonder why I chose to love it so much, since it is not at all like anything I would enjoy reading now.
Maybe I thought I should love it since Kendra loved it, because she was the big literary influence in my life (based on the [come to find out, fake] fact that she learned to read before me).
In any case, books like this should have been banned, far and wide, from my bookshelf.
"Six Months to Live" is about Dawn Rochelle, a normal thirteen year old girl.
Her life was perfect until she was tested positive for cancer.
She lost her spot on the cheering squad and missed almost all of the eighth grade year.
Cancer sucks!
It ruined her entire life!
But maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't be so bad with Sandy around...
Someone facing the exact same battle as her, someone to comfort her when she's going through all the pain.
Sandy and Dawn quickly become inseparable and make eachother stronger.
Will they both make it out okay?
Will they both win the fight?
The reason i bought the book was because when i was reading the back the word "CANCER" jumped out at me.
So anyways, I bought all these books because they were about cancer, I didn't know there where diffrent kinds of cancers and tumors...I just know my grandma had both.
But i guess in a way they also helped me prepair for what was to come in real life.
I lost my Beloved Grandma when I was 13 years old...she fought long and she fought hard to stay with us as long as she could...she died at the young age of 57, and I was there with her until her last breath.
Dawn Rochelle is a 13 year old girl who wants to have a normal life, full of cheer leading, boys, sleepovers, etc.
Unfortunately, Dawn's life is far from normal.
She has found out that she has leukemia, and is going to have to stay in the hospital for a few weeks, even months, for however long chemotherapy takes to get her in remission.
Through her stay, she goes through sickness, laughs, and hope that she will soon be in remission.
There are some happiness and surprises at the end, but you will have to read the book to find out.
***SPOILER ALERT*** When you thought your life was ordinary,Cancer had to show up...Dawn Rochelle was a 13 year old ordinary girl.Then one day she was diagnosed with Leukemia which is cancer to the bone marrow.
Everyday she has to take medicine.The drugs make her loose appetite for her food it made them taste weird and funny like sweet things turned bitter.Dawn and Sandy became instant best friends they both understood each other and knew what it was like to have cancer.
The hospital is very important because that's where Dawn mets her best friend, Sandy.
I thought the end of the book was really sad.One day Dawn gets a telegram and it's from Sandy's parents.Sandy died.
No one wants to think about how terrible it must be to think you're getting weird bruises because you're a cheerleader and then find out you've got blood cancer and you have to get poisoned by chemotherapy until it dies, just hoping you survive longer than the cancer.
(If you don't want to read about stuff like the trauma of hair loss, the horror of growing so skinny that your own bones can bruise you, or the disgusting things chemotherapy can do to you, do not read this book.) I had absolutely no experience with cancer in my family or among my friends so this was a huge wake-up call for me, and I still think about it sometimes.
Admitted to the hospital, Dawn begins the chemotherapy regime and meets Sandy Chandler who also has lymphocytic leukemia.
Both girls lose their hair and share happy times in the hospital activity room.
Then, Dawn is stricken with a serious viral infection and spends time in intensive care.
When Dawn recovers, Sandy gives her a picture of Dawn’s bear, Mr. Ruggers, and his brigade of cancer-fighting bears vanquishing the cancer cells.
They spend two wonderful weeks at cancer camp meeting boys, playing practical jokes on the camp leader, and acting like normal teenage girls.
Little do the girls know that this will be their last time together.
A simply written, inspirational story about thirteen-year-old, Dawn Rochelle, who is battling with leukemia. This book will particularly appeal to pre-teen girls who enjoy books that tear at the heart-strings.
I read this book when I was in middle school; it’s one of those books I found myself reading twice.❤️
In the book six months to live Danielle Rochelle shows Bravery. Danielle Has cancer she is slowly dying and she shows bravery and strengths when she is about to die she fights to come back even after she flat lined. She wasn’t going to die yet. Daniele Rochelle also shows signs of persistence. She will always stay strong even when she is sick or has to get up to early for chemo she still is happy and goes every time always staying positive.
It overall was a great book and I definitely enjoyed it, like a lot.**SPOILER**  I thought the part when Dawn's mom had the hair salon woman come in and give the girls wigs was really cute.
ANd the part when Sandy was like, 'you aren't going swimming?' And Mike was like 'no' and then you find out about the type of cancer he had and I thought that that was really cute that even though everything with his cancer he still went swimming because Sandy wanted him to.
Six months to live, written by Lurlene McDaniel was the book I chose to read.
As the reader this book left me feeling that everything was connected in some way meaning that everything happens for a reason.
As Lurlene McDaniel said, "from every ending, comes a new beginning." As Dawn learns she has cancer she goes through a phase of denial.
When Dawn meets Sandy she is at first a little shy but they quickly become friends.
As the reader, there was constantly a feeling as if I was there with Dawn living with her during this time.
Dawn thought her bruises were from cheerleading practice, but after she also started feeling tired all the time, she went to the doctor and was diagnosed with leukemia.
Chemotherapy replaces cheerleading, and she begins an existence full of blood cell counts, hair loss, and horrible weakness.
It's an inspiring but realistic account of this horrible disease that keeps the story's heart close to its characters.People who do not want to read about the gritty details of cancer treatment should not read this book.
It frightened me as a child, but I cared enough about Dawn that I wanted to know what would happen to her.
When she is in the hospital, she meets a new friend.
They did everthing together but one day Dawns friend Sandy was well enough to go home.
While Dawn and Sandy were at camp they became more than friends with two boys.
When camp was over, Dawn received a letter from Sandy.
The letter was about bad news.
If you want to know what the letter said and about all of the ups and downs of Dawns life, you can read "Six Months to Live" by Lurlene McDaniel.
In sixth-grade my best friend and I were obsessed with Lurlene McDaniel.
Combined we probably checked out everyone of her books in the school library during our sixth grade year.
We would go straight to the M section of the library each time we visited and discuss which titles we had read and which we liked best.
(you know, instead of yet another horse book) Also, it was probably the first time in my life that a peer recommended a book/author to me and I was able to share the joy of chatting about books with a like-minded/similarly obsessed individual.
Its the type of book that you can never put down because its so intense and you want to know what is going to happen next.
This book is based on a girl who was diagnosed with cancer, as he begins treatment and chemotherapy she becomes nauseous and ill.
With some help from her new roommate Sandy who also has cancer, she begins to fight and battle her disease.
I thought this book was great, and had lots of meaning.
It has a great plot and exposition, and you really get hooked one the book.
This is the first book I read back when I was in junior high.
I didn't read books till this one I Loved it, sad book about a girl who grts cancer at a young age.
Full of life, meets her best friend in the hospital on the oncology floor, where they become the best frends, ho to cancer camp together.
Awesome writer and story.
The stoty is somewhat sad but good, it's about life, love, happiness, sickness, getting better, dying, hope, faith.
If you loved this book you will like the other ones in the series.
all awesome!
Being 13 is all about sleepovers, cheer, friends, etc.
For Dawn Rochelle, life is very tensed when she finds out she has leukemia, a type of cancer.
Dawn has many supporters throughout her disease but she still feels very lonely.
I liked this book a lot.
It gives the reader a perspective of hard life becomes when you have cancer.
Lurlene McDaniel delivers this story as if she were Dawn keeping a diary while going through this tragedy and coping with cancer.
This is a must read for soft people and adventurous people who like to try new things!!
I think I would have enjoyed this series more had I read it when I was younger. The main character is thirteen and the author writes her as a thirteen-year-old. I could have related to Dawn Rochelle so much more if I had read this ten years ago. Dawn collects teddy bears, makes macaroni artwork and has everyday little crushes. I found that it read a little too prematurely for me. Younger girls, by all means, pick this up as a stepping stone for when you read The Fault in Our Stars! Seventh Grade Girls Especially!!!
This book is very suspenceful with 114 pages in it.The setting is more at a summer camp.
Two girls, Dawn and Sandy, have leukemia and meet in their hospital room.
After a while they get out of the hospital and both meet back at a summer camp for people with all types of canser.
They have fun their and meet some new friends.
They go home and...I would really sugest this book, more to girl teens, but if you like suspence read this.
I give this book a 4 out of 5 because it stares of borning.
Six months to live the teenager named dawn finding out she was going to die soon at a young age.

She was dying because she had cancer (leukemia) and she's scared.
Dawn meets a friend who also has cancer.
They both battle the disease together and become best friends.Dawn and Sandy become even more closer when both of their hair falls out after the treatment.
She's afraid she will die and won't get a chance to hang out with her friends and tell the guy she likes how much she loves him.
It was the summer of 1988 when I was 14 and attain the original published 1985 paperback with a girl holding a teddy bear sitting on a hospital bed as the cover.
I was hooked on this book of the bravery and inspiration of the main character Dawn.
It depicts humanity of a young girl at 13 who desires a normal life but learn of her fate with cancer.
It was through "Six Months To Live" that compelled me at first to learn about cancer, what chemotherapy is, what remission is, etc.
All in all, it is a heartbreaking, inspirational and very moving book.
Six Months to live was a inspiring story.I really enjoyed it because the author focused a lot on the

This book was about a teen named Dawn that was diagnosed with cancer.

I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone!
this is one of the first books i read when i was like 14 or 15. i havent found it since. i love this site officially now. this book stole my heart when i read it. my heart went out to this girl. i remember she was so brave. i deffiantly would read this book over again. i need to read it again to do an official review. but u know it is awesome if it took the heart of a 14/15 year old who just started reading....
Summary: Thirteen year old Dawn Rochelle is diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, a type of cancer that is more commonly found in kids. Dawn is sent to a hospital where she will be treated for her disease. Dawn soon discovers she has a roommate named Sandy, they become friends almost immediately. Both Dawn and Sandy are given series of different drugs until the doctors find what works for them and they are in remission. Both will their remission last for long?
I first read this when I was around 11 years old....Liked it then...Found it at a garage sale awhile ago finished it last night and still liked it!The only thing I hated was the ending I would have loved to see her return to camp and give the ashes of Sandy to the fire renewal ceremony....Or at least more define the romance between one of the two guys...Otherwise a very good book to help children understand the emotions and kinda the background of leukemia.
