I know, for some people reading for school makes a book less fun for them because of all the analyzing every little thing, quizzes on every chapter etc etc, but for me when my teacher explains all those little things about the book, it's actually interesting.
However, because this is "school required reading," it is not the cause of my low rating.
(I'll explain it later on in my review and it's a huge spoiler, it will be marked don't worry!)The story starts out with two white, Christian kids from the modern world, Mary (age 13) and Peter (age 8) plane crashed in an Australian desert.
Walkabout did not receive much attention until 1971, after a movie based on the book, but not faithful to it, was released, to critical acclaim.Eleven year old Mary and her eight year old brother Peter are residents of Charleston, South Carolina who find themselves stranded after their Adelaide-bound plane has crashed and exploded in the desert of the Northern Territory of Australia.
A simple misunderstanding between Mary and the Aborigine leads to a tragic consequence, which places all of their lives in jeopardy.I found Walkabout to be a mildly enjoyable though repetitive and heavy-handed story about cultural misunderstandings and similarities, which can best be thought of as a dated young adult novel.
I'm surprised at people saying nothing happens in the book because in my mind, each plot point and each detail of Peter and Mary's interactions with the bush boy stand out clearly even 17-18 years after I read it: Mary clucking like a mother hen around Peter, the bush boy teaching the city kids to get water by sucking reeds, the bush boy trying to communicate with the city kids and vice versa, Mary giving the bush boy her underpants, the frenzied eerie ceremonial dance which is the precursor to tragedy, the bush boy realizing Mary is a girl and tossing her the heaviest load to carry, the kids eating a rock wallaby...
Walkabout's Mary was the FIRST real (i.e. independent) happily-female character (unlike George in Famous Five) I ever read about who was powerful and clearly a protagonist ...
With themes of nature and survival, this book set in the Australian outback is both vivid and intense, and as the two stranded siblings start to trust their new friend, it becomes a story about friendship and growing up.

Thinking about it now, over a decade later, after only reading it that one time, I'm surprised at how many details of the plot I remember.
I think I remember feeling disdain for the Aboriginal boy because it seemed to me that he willed himself to death when it wasn't necessary for him to die.
I understand this strange behaviour slightly better now and found myself feeling strong irritation at Mary's irrational fears of the Aboriginal boy.
He'd already gotten over the cold he contracted from Peter and was getting better, but still he believed so fervently that Mary had seen the Spirit of Death in him that he was able to make himself die, make his body give up and shut down.
I'm not entirely sure why I read this book.
I bought this book at Barnes & Noble.
If you live in the Twin Cities and find yourself in possession of a Barnes & Noble giftcard, I highly recommend checking out the HarMar location.
Me, I'll take a used book any day.
If I throw a book across the room in anger, the book is usually fine.
Maybe read the book if you are a fan of the movie?That being said, if you are going to read Walkabout, I recommend reading it in book form.

"Sturt Plain, where the aircraft had crashed, is in the centre of the Northern Territory.
Most of the inhabitants are grouped around three or four small towns ��� Tennant Creek, Hooker Creek, and Daly Waters ��� which means that the rest of the area is virtually uninhabited.
Brother and sister were products of the highest strata of humanity's evolution. In them the primitive had long ago been swept aside, been submerged by mechanization, been swamped by scientific development, been nullified by the standardized pattern of the white man's way of life...It was very different with the Aboriginal. He knew what reality was. He led a way of life that was already old when Tut-ankh-amen started to build his tomb.(Walkabout, pp. 25-26)Noble savage sacrifices self to save civilized white people! Story at eleven.
Read in the early Seventies. I love the Nicolas Roeg film, too, even though it changes some plot essentials.

I thought I had read this as a child or teenager, but I had a clear idea of the ending that turned out to be wrong, so I must have misunderstood what happened at the end when I was younger.
Anyway, that's how it starts and fortunately for them they meet a native Australian boy on walkabout who helps them find water and food.However, it's not a sunny little story of how kids are blind to racial differences.
The American girl and the Australian boy are just too old for that.
It's more about the (sometimes unintentionally) devastating effect of white people and European/North American culture on native Australian and other societies and cultures.
It reads like an Australian classic, but was actually written by an English author who spent time studying the country.
The descriptions of the Australian landscape were superb and I was particularly impressed by the details of the Aboriginal culture, many of which were new to me.I read it to my sons (aged 8 and 10) and they both enjoyed it – particularly the scenes involving the Australian wildlife.The overall message of the book is one of tolerance and understanding between different cultures, so it was useful to use this text to explain issues around racism.
This was a short, mildly enjoyable book.
Throughout most of the story almost nothing happens, except for the death of the bush boy, and it continues that way until the end of the book.
The first half was thoroughly captivating but along the way it got way too repetitive in its descriptions of the Australian outback (though very well written), and it didn’t really feel like it was going anywhere.
It had a good message about cultural differences and acceptance but Marshal could have taken it a bit further and emphasized it more.Overall, it had some good moments, but it was a fairly OK book to me.
This was a very enjoyable read. There were so many life lessons in such a small book. Language and race is only a problem when one allows it to be a problem. When one is taught that it is a problem. One must learn for themselves the meaning of what life is supposed to be. When this is done, only then will unity, love and peace exist.
My first introduction to Aboriginal culture and Australia in general. I first picked this book up in the 4th grade and have very fond memories of reading it 5 times. That's how spellbound I became with this book and till today though I look at it with new eyes and understanding, it yet still holds a fond place in my heart.
Good read for children. Concise yet there is a lot of detail about their surroundings and the characters are very believable. Their dialogue, actions and reactions are age appropriate and culturally realistic.
Continuing my Australian reading kicked off by Ruth Park and D'Arcy Niland. Fascinating story, and makes me want to learn more about Aboriginal culture. Published originally in 1959 so of course the language regarding 'darkies' represents attitudes then. I will try and search some literature out now written by Aboriginal heritage authors. Incidentally, I recall the film had a very different slant. How writers must hate their work being fiddled around with!
Loved it, a heart warming story about the lives and trails of two children in the outback after their plane crashes and they are the soul survivors
I think it's unlikely such a book would be written today. (view spoiler)[It's a snippet of their story - there's no official "beginning", with the airplane crash, nor "end" when they get home - with very short chapters, and yet it had a strange power. (hide spoiler)]It's obvious the author knew Australia very well, and amazing how much description he managed to cram into such a short book, without it feeling intrusive. Instead, it's almost as if the children themselves are turning their heads, t
(hide spoiler)]It's obvious the author knew Australia very well, and amazing how much description he managed to cram into such a short book, without it feeling intrusive.
The Aboriginal boy's thoughts are well blended, without being a stark contrast or feeling like there's more of a divide between the children, and the author sensitive to cultural differences.My edition also contained pictures and some captions from the movie.
(view spoiler)[It also looks like the movie made the boy much older, and made the sexual connotations more apparent.
I was once told a story about an Aboriginal man who showed up in an abandoned settlement during WWII, and, finding nobody there, led his family through the Outback to another settlement, arriving with all well-fed and healthy.
Old stories told around campfires in his childhood.Burke and Wills, on the other hand, died from having arrived at their appointed rendezvous a mere 9 HOURS too late.
Is the lesson that we drown our 'survival instincts' with our scholarly educations?
But there are no native placental mammals in Australia except bats, and no monotremes anywhere BUT Australia.The lesson, surely, is that 'education' is multifarious.
Zwei weiße Kinder treffen im australischen Outback auf einen Aborigine Jungen, der ihnen hilft, in der Wildnis zu überleben.
Der Aborigine befindet sich gerade auf dem Walkabout, einem traditionellen Ritual der Mannwerdung.Zum einen wird die australische Landschaft mit ihrer faszinierenden Tier- und Pflanzenwelt beschrieben, zum anderen treffen zwei völlig verschiedene Kulturen aufeinander: zwei weiße Kinder aus der ersten Hälfte des 20.
Jahrhunderts und ein Aborigine, der vermutlich bisher keinen Kontakt zur weißen Kutur hatte.In der Klett-Ausgabe gelesen, die mit vielen Wortangaben versehen ist und in einem Anhang zusätzliche Informationen zu den Aborigines und ihrer Kultur gibt.
Des Weiteren beinhaltet das Buch verschiedene Ausschnitte von verlorengegangenen und zum Teil geretteten Menschen im Outback und zwei Karten von Australien.
But the thing I hated was the Aborigine boy was never dignified with a name throughout, only referred as "bush boy".
He is referred "primitive", but the boy does show how they have successfully lived in a hostile environment for thousands of years.
Then the whole idea of the Aboriginal people's battle with fear of death.
How can a culture lives continually in fear of death or dying?
Finally the book ended to sudenly and which with left me not sure of what was going on!The story raises important questions about the supposed superiority of Western civilization over supposed inferiority of 'colored' people and 'native' cultures.
Had never heard of this novel until reading review in NYRB, which I gather is actually the Intro to new NYRB edition. Siegel's intro also comments on a film version of the novel, which, though it sounds interesting in its own right, departs in some significant ways from the book (but then, don't they all ... or most) but that difference only highlighted the appeal of the novel. Sounds like another literary resurrection from NYRB worthy of our celebration and gratitude (and another cool cover, which should please GR Friend S. Sloat ever so much!)http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi...
Four-star rating for a few reasons: (1) The book is a memorable one from when I was in school, and w
This short novel is notable for its really remarkable descriptions of the Australian landscape, as well as the sheer sadness and loveliness of the central storyline. I found Marshall's overall style to be a bit heavy-handed at times: the contrasts drawn between the Aboriginal boy and the American children (who are named Peter and Mary, leaving me to assume that the Aboriginal is the sacrificial Christ figure here, of pure goodness, dying for the sins of civilization) were hardly subtle. Still, for all its simplicity, or maybe even because of that simplicity, the narrative is really quite moving and profound.
Lovely idea of children rescued in the Australian Bush by Aboriginal boy. But very dated writing--very patronizing towards the boy, very ridiculously English "American" children, and very romanticized version of children and Australia both. The book wants to be a psychological study, a travel guide, an allegory, and a moral fable. The best parts are when it just wants to be a story. There aren't enough of those.
I am glad that I didn't dismiss this book as a "children's book". The untold eeyorish story between the lines is disturbingly dark and ends abruptly ... of course the story itself is a 50 year old adventure story for children, but coupled with the impressive description of the aboriginal outback, the story has a dreamy dark texture which i absolutely loved. I am intrigued as to how the 'Lord of the flies' fandom missed this one.
Beautifully illustrative of the aboriginal outback, beautiful imagery and a simple classic story for young adults. I would have loved if this was longer. Also, truly disappointed by the ending. What a waste, what a cliche.
This is the story of an Aboriginal boy's walkabout and two American children lost in the Australian bush. When they meet, Mary and Peter learn about the desert. They follow the boy to food and water. Now they have finish their journey home!
