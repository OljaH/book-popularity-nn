Double triple Mega Meh.It's been a while since I read a Johanna Lindsey that wasn't a re-read.
As I read this I realized I had read all of the other Malory stories attached to the corresponding Malory characters in this book.
And I also realized something about the H in this book.*****For serious though.
Plus, he and the h barely knew each other and spent what felt like 95% of the book apart.
This just wasn't a Lindsey hit for me.
The story of a pwecious darling orphaned Pooky Honey Boo Boo Starshine who is the apple of her series-bait uncles' eyes, and the pussy "rake" Nicholas Eden who is all wah-wah about being a bastard.General idiocy ensues.The heroine's name is Regina, but I got slammed with "Reggie" the entire book.
It makes me think I'm supposed to be visually or mentally impaired and I get cranky.Yeah, I put on my DERP face when I started reading it because I knew it was the only way it wouldn't hurt like a chili pepper enema.
Or maybe JL just makes crap up as she thinks of it.

Η Ρετζίνα εκτός από όμορφη είναι πολύ δυναμική. Κι ο Νίκολας, νομίζω ότι στο πρόσωπό της βρίσκει το "μάστορά" του.Απόλαυσα την ανάγνωση του πρώτου βιβλίου της οικογένειας Μαλόρι και σίγουρα θα διαβάσω και τα επόμενα.
This review was originally posted on Addicted To Romance I decided to re read this Malory Anderson series, as I am working on character sketch for this series and I had realized that I haven't reviewed much of the series and somehow Love Only Once fell through the cracks. And boy did I have a wonderful time reconnecting with this fun family and this romance that just gave me laughs and fun times.

Regina is a heroine you just fall in love with right away.
After visiting her Uncle Anthony, she is mistaken for someone else and kidnapped and taken to Nicholas Eden's home.
But with the fun interference from Regina's family bring them back together and it gets pretty lively.
You will fall in love with Nicholas and Regina and the whole Malory Family.
The hero is with his mistress at the beginning of the book and he's decided that he's bored of her.
He decides to tell her the affair is over after a big social engagement they're attending.
His mistress can tell his affections are waning and tries to bait the hero into marriage which doesn't work.
Then it switches to the heroine and her family and all their relatives are listed as they get ready for a big social event.
I like rakish hero's but the one in here didn't feel charming to me.
The heroine's personality didn't feel engaging and her oh-so-sad plight of being beautiful and unmarried turned me off.
We get to meet Regina aka Reggie who is an orphan with four overprotective uncles.
Regina borrows Lady Selena's carriage to go to her brother Anthony.
Selena was Nicholas mistress and when Nicholas sees her carriage he mistakenly kidnap Regina.
*Happy sigh*I actually read this book after reading #3 Gentle Rogue and #4 Magic of You. I kind of regretted it but after reading it now I think it might actually be the perfect order because I already know James and Anthony and all the others.
I can't wait to read Tender Rebel to finally get Anthony's story.
Στο επίκεντρο της αφήγησης, η Ρετζίνα Άστον και ο Νίκολας Ίντεν.
Η απαγωγή της πρώτης από τον δεύτερο θα τους οδηγήσει σε μονοπάτια σκοτεινά και παθιασμένα, αλλά και γεμάτα αγάπη αρκεί να είναι σε θέση να πολεμήσουν τα σκοτάδια του και ν' αφήσουν πίσω το παρελθόν.
Αρκετά ενδιαφέρουσα πλοκή με καλή δόμηση της αφήγησης, αν και λόγω του στοιχείου της επιβολής μιας ερωτικής κατάστασης ανάμεσα στους δύο πρωταγωνιστές, είναι αρκετά πιθανόν κάποιες αναγνώστριες να ενοχληθούν.
Παρ' όλα ταύτα έχουμε να κάνουμε με μια ιστορία με ίντριγκα και πάθος, που διατηρεί αμείωτο το ενδιαφέρον του αναγνώστη και που τους φανατικούς του είδους, ίσως και να τους συνεπάρει.
Ειλικρινά μου άρεσε πάρα πολύ αυτό το βιβλίο! Ολόκληρη η οικογένεια Μάλορι είναι συναρπαστική και ολίγον τι... τρελή! Αλλά ήταν απολαυστικοί!!! Όλοι τους!!! Θα ήθελα να διαβάσω όλη τους την ιστορία, του καθένα ξεχωριστά... Ελπίζω η "Διόπτρα" να εκδόσει και τα υπόλοιπα βιβλία, και ας μη ξεχνάμε το δεύτερο της σειράς διότι το ξέχασε και πήδηξε στην έκδοση του τρίτου... Για όνομα του θεού!!!
2'5 para el primero de los Malory. La historia no está mal y definitivamente Anthony y James son ansñsbsñañskdks pero parece escrita por el mono loco
Sweet, melted Velveeta, I couldn't help but love this book.
Even though it has the dreaded Big Misunderstandings over and over (and over and over) again, the writing is intelligent, the characters fleshed out and likable, the plot engaging, and the romance sort of jarringly sweet without being saccharine.
Reggie was amazing, and as someone who grows weary of the female stereotypes in these books (they're either indiscriminate whores or blushing ninnies) I couldn't help but celebrate a virgin character who, for once, wasn't rendered speechless by a little flirting and innuendo.
*3,5Mejor de lo que recordaba, la verdad. La trama romántica se sostiene por una serie de malentendidos, que con que la pareja se hubieran sentado a hablar se hubieran arreglado, aunque claro, entonces no habría novela 😅Es una novela entretenida, divertida, romántica aunque me ha faltado momentos que me hicieran suspirar, pero aún así es un buen libro para iniciarse en la saga de los Mallory, a partir de este vienen los mejores. Las historias de Anthony y James.
The first half of the book is 5 stars definitely!! Second half is full of incredibly annoying misunderstandings that ruined it for me. So I settled for 3 stars.
But when he realizes his enemy's wife is also his beloved niece, and introduces her to his own illegitimate son, soon all is forgiven and there is a big happy family reunion and he goes to drag Nicholas home again.This all happens around 55% and I began rolling my eyes so much I was afraid I would do permanent damage to the sockets, but it's a really quick read and I thought, "When Nicholas gets back, things have to improve again!" But no....Nicholas and Regina have missed each other and want to reconcile, but both are too stubborn to admit it, so they keep fighting.
No matter how much I may enjoy an author, I just can't stomach a plot where the kind, loving heoine is used, abused and treated absolutely abominably (flaunting other mistresses in her presence, abandoned on his doorstep on their wedding night etc.) by the hero(?)throughout the entire book as this one does.
The biggest insult, however, was after an entire book of this behavior, the hero comes into ravish the heroine after a night of drinking, after which both are happy.
The book rated 2 stars only because the author did a good job of keeping me turning the pages.
Okay, I'm cheating here, and I don't like them all equally, but I do love the Mallory's. They're all funny. I especially liked Love Only Once (the first book), Gentle Rogue (my favorite), and The Magic of You (where the heroine chases the hero shamelessly).
Rereading this was a pleasure! <3

Review in a few! This one may take a minute. Cause I remember loving it but it was full of things I hated.
I wanted to read a book in the Malory series so thought better begin at the beginning.
Apart from the H’s repetitive randy ‘let me love you’ line and the h thinking that she better marry him after he ruins her reputation (following a drunken abduction where he mistakes her for his cheating mistress), they had no connect or feelings to speak of.
I wanted to castrate him there but he’s actually not worth the effort.
Then he wants to bed her and she’s okay with it?
Προτού καν ξεκινήσω να διαβάζω το πρώτο βιβλίο της σειράς,είχα ήδη ακούσει τα καλύτερα λόγια από τις φίλες μου για τη Johanna Lindsey και τα βιβλία της.
Ήρωες που,σύμφωνα με τα πρέπει και τους κανόνες που διέπουν την εποχή τους θα έπρεπε να είναι βαλμένοι σε καλούπια,κι όμως τόσο απελευθερωμένοι!
Κι όλα σε χορταστικές δόσεις,με μια γραφή που σε κερδίζει από την πρώτη ματιά και σε εντυπωσιάζει με τη σύγχρονη γλώσσα της,αν αναλογιστεί κανείς πως το συγεκριμένο βιβλίο γράφτηκε το 1985!Λάτρεψα την ηρωίδα,τη Ρετζίνα,η οποία είναι από τις πιο γεμάτες ζωντάνια κι ενεργητικότητα ηρωίδες που γνώρισα ποτέ!
Λάτρεψα την οικογένειά της,τους τρελούς,αξιαγάπητους θείους της.
I really enjoyed the first book of the Malory series.
Four tough Malory men who love her dearly but could never agree on anything when it came to Reggie!
When Nicholas Eden captures Reggie and locks her in his room he is so drawn to her and her tempting beauty.
He only slept with Reggie once 4 months before they married so how could he have a son?
Nicholas was so jaded when it came to marriage because of his own parentage.
He was so worried that Reggie would hate him when the truth came out.
I thoroughly enjoyed Regina and Nicholas' love story. I did become a bit frustrated with all their bickering. They were at odds throughout most of the book. Nonetheless, I did love getting to know the Mallory characters again. I've listened to many of the other books in this series, but I had missed this one for some reason. My personal favorite of the Mallory family is James' story. He is a marvelous character and he is introduced in this book. Happy reading!
me parto con James y Anthony Malory jajajaaj
RATING: 1.5 stars.Herói: *embebeda heroína*Heroína (quando sabe): Uau, ele gosta tanto de mim que até me embebedou para poder ir para a cama comigo. It's luuuurve.No.
I can't believe I forgot how much I love Johanna Lindsey.
Stands the test of time. Thoroughly enjoyed.
αυτο το βιβλιο ειναι ενα αρλεκιν..και γω μισω τα αρλεκιν...εχει τραγικα κακη μεταφραση και εκφρασεις που δεν εχουν καμια επαφη με το 1800 που διαδραματιζετε το βιβλιο ,παρολλα αυτα το αγαπησα..με ξεκουρασε και μαρεσε πολυ ασχετα με το ποσο χαζομαρα ειναι...ελπιζω να βγαλατε ακρη με αυτα που γραφω
I read this when I was younger and thought I liked it, and it was ok till the hero takes off for 7 months right after the wedding. We don't really know much of what he did except he was working at his plantation. Well I hate finishing a book and having questions that will never get answered. Did the hero cheat on heroine? That kind of stuff is important and wouldn't the heroine think so? Not this heroine. So I will not read again.
There was a lot about this book that I enjoyed, and I've read a whole lot of Johanna Lindsey's books.
A lot of Lindsey's books have the "main character resists spilling the beans about secret from the past, beyond all boundaries of praticality and good sense," and this was no different, except that in this book, the secret was from the man's past instead of the heroine's.The "resolution" of our romantic leads' differences came in part because of a whole lot of deceit on his part and a whole lot of ignorance on hers...
