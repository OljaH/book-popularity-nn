However, in Farley’s book, the animals bitten by the rabid vampire bat die immediately, but the bat lives for a long time with the disease.
It seems to me as though the bitten animal shouldn’t die immediately, but rather should just contract rabies and die of that several days later.
But since Farley is apparently no longer interested, at this point in the series, in making sense, we’ll let that pass.The book was also a gyp because the Black and Flame never fight OR race, so we still have no idea which stallion is THE BEST.There are only four books left in this series.
9/2012 Oh, man. I re-read this before I noticed it was on my never-again shelf. Seriously: never again! This one is crammed full of cliches and ridiculousness. Stay away.8/2011 Didn't hold up so well, sadly. A rabid vampire bat? Rilly? *sigh* So many things wrong here, starting with the bat's behaviour. No, no, no!All the Flame books disappointed me this go-round, and they won't be staying on the shelf any longer.
I recently found this book among my childhood keepsakes. In rereading it again 40+ years later It obviously doesn't hold up to the same level of entertainment it did as a young girl. An apparent favorite, if I had reviewed it then, I no doubt would have given it 5 stars.
Absolutely an excellent read. But I wonder if two stallions could be able to get along in certain situations like that. The fact that the Black can come back and forth from the wild and due to the fact that the love for Alec is so strong it touches me deeply.
DNF - I believe this is where I stopped reading the series. Don't remember why, though, so I'll leave it at that.
Loved this novel as a child.
loved every book in this series....my best friend Laura and I couldn't read them fast enough
It is maybe not the best of the series, but it certainly isn't the worst.Farley always writes good adventure stories.
When you pick up a science fiction book about Star Trek, you don't do it and then spend your time grumbling about the fact that none of the space travel stuff makes sense.
If you really love the series, if you really love the old-time adventure style stories, you let yourself get caught up in the action, not the details.
If you do find yourself preferring fact over fun, then maybe this particular adventure series isn't the thing for you.
It has the problem that a lot of the other Black Stallion books seem to have, which is sometimes I feel like the author is running out of ideas.
From there he introduces the conflicts in the story: Alec looking for his horse, a rabid vampire bat flying around, and the contest between the two stallions.
The vampire bit was kind of interesting, and the author did actually delve into some biology of the bat, which I liked.
Just kind of a weird tangent story for this series.
Um, a vampire bat.
I wish he would have found a more...realistic, though I hesitate to use the term, way of bringing the two together for the first time.I did believe Flame and the Black teaming up against the bat because even in animals, a common enemy is a uniting force.
And I'm glad any (view spoiler)[fighting between the two was quickly curtailed (hide spoiler)], even if that made this book yet another pointless installment in the series.
The worst parts of my imagination not being included was all that salvaged the book from otherwise being one star.
While I always love reading about The Black Stallion, my favorite times are those between him and his beloved boy Alec.
The Black Stallion and Flame keeps them separated for most of the story, and so it's not as enjoyable for me as some of the other books in the series.
Even so, I couldn't skip it in a reread of the series.The Black Stallion and Alec Ramsey find themselves crashing into the sea once more.
We've seen Flame fight another stallion, we've seen the Black and Alec shipwrecked, and we've seen them both fight against nature and man to be reunited.
I suppose it was inevitable for Walter Farley to have his two most famous creations -- the Black Stallion and the Island Stallion -- meet in not one, but two books, where the stallions compete in the two things they are best at -- fighting and racing.
Here is the fighting challenge book.I absolutely adored this book as a kid, but as an adult I cannot help but wince at how Farley turned the series into a caricature of itself.
Here's another plane crash, another stallion fight, yada yada.
Loved the book when I was a child. Walter Farley had a way of speaking to me. His horse books have an odd romantic aspect to them that helped develop my appreciation for horses as a youngster. I'd recommend any Farley book to youngsters growing up. Today they speak to a different day and time. A better day and time, when things were simpler; society, ethics, and people's belief in a concept of right.
Walter Farley is a great author and makes the Black Stallion books great. The black has seen Flame before but now they meet and what a meet it is. This book kept me reading and guessing. It will captivate you and hold you till the end. Another great by Mr. Farley. Recommended for anyone who loves the Black Stallion series.
Ohh, I loved this book as an 11 year old. I even wrote an (in retrospect) extremely amatuerish fanfiction for it, back before fanfiction.net even existed... The idea of the Black and Flame squaring off in a fight tickled me...
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
This is one of my favorite books in the series, the Black meets Flame on Flame's island. Part of the theme is a rabid vampire bat, which the two Stallions must ward off. One of my favorite books ever!
It can get tricky when a writer decides to combine two favourite horses from slightly different worlds. It was still enjoyable though, although not as much as others in the series. I could sense Mr Farley's frustration in deciding how to end it by the way Alec talks about the race at the end.
Totally ridiculous. I'm amazed at how hot and cold this series runs as I've journeyed on my re-read. The Black and Flame "team up" (no joke) to fight off a rabid vampire bat (again, no joke). Stupid book.
SM
The Black Stallion and Flame (The Black Stallion, #15)Farley, Walterthe two horse learn how to live with each other, and that they can over come their competitive nature.
Fiction,Children's fiction
It is a good book.Sometimes it is confusing.Other wise a good book to read.
I think this book was really good(Along with other of Walter Farleys books) But I like some of the other black stallion books better....Still A favorite!!
The very first book I bought in the series through scholastic books via school. After I got it I found out it was part of a set and the rest is history lol.
awesome
Read this as a child and enjoyed the experience all over again!
I loved this one because it brought the two great horses together in the wild.
I always thought the meeting between these two stallions would be better.
