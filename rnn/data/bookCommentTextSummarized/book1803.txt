Another book I read years ago. Not my favorite of Wright's, because I don't honestly enjoy tales of labor uprisings and riots, but it is masterfully written, and Helen is a strong, well-drawn character.I wish I had the dust jacket pictured here, but my copy is an humble red cover without it.
Another book my sister's and I couldn't put down.
I fell in love with this book and its message. Harold Bell Wright was a master at understanding mankind.
Well written.
The Interpreter is the hub character.
The one class represented by the Ward family (Adam, John, Helen) and McIver.
The other class represented by the Captain, the dad, and Mary.
The agitator Vodel and stupid follower Whaley.
Whaley's children Bobby and Maggie introduce the story and quite appropriately wrap up the end of the story.
Well planned, the logic well laid out, the story thread perfectly followed.
Little wonder that this author was the first to make $1 million back in 1921.One thing is certain, technology changes but people predictable as ever and the personalities don't change.
I know Wright was one of the most popular writers of his time, but this particular book was subpar vintage fiction.
