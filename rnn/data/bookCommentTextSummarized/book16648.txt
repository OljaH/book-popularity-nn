It’s important that you understand this about me because I’m about make a shocking statement, here: In order to enjoy this series, it isn’t necessary to read the first book.
My overall feelings about this story have nothing to do with the fact that I’m not a fan of time travel, rather everything to do with the hero and heroine.Hawk has all the characteristics of an amazing hero, and I adored him!
I’m giving this 2.5 stars because Hawk was hot.Again, this book is not necessary to the ongoing storyline of the series.
3.5 starsI'm having mixed feelings about this one as a whole but I would just like to say that my 3.5 star rating is, in this case, a rather positive one. I actually enjoyed reading the majority of this novel and I also wouldn't mind checking out Moning's other Highland novels as I've heard this is the least popular of the series. It suffered somewhat from the inevitable comparisons that I simply had to make to the Fever series, it was nothing like those and I'm starting to believe nothing ever
It suffered somewhat from the inevitable comparisons that I simply had to make to the Fever series, it was nothing like those and I'm starting to believe nothing ever will be.But my first impressions of the novel were good, I found it to be a kind of fae version of Outlander, where the female protagonist ends up time-travelling several centuries back into a Scotland complete with kilted men, feudalism and sexism.
All was in readiness, the nursery was merely biding time - until the right woman would come along and breathe into it the sparkling life of children's songs and dreams and hopes."Barrons would have babies for breakfast.I occasionally love to indulge in the guilty pleasure of finding out how the heap of misunderstandings will miraculously lead to THE deflowering scene.
It's always exciting to find out whether:1) the heroine - however often almost thirty, married and divorced and ridiculously hot - turns out to be a Surprise Virgin after all;2) and when that fact will become obvious to the hero, when he 'thrusts' his 'shaft' - or rather his 'engorged phallus' (KMM’s words, not mine!) - into her and suddenly stumbles upon a 'barricade' somewhere halfway up.
FOUR HIGHLAND STARS.It was about time for me to read this new-to-me author. I wanted epic love, a toe curling romance, and a love that would sweep me off my feet and this book delivered. Moning provided me with the perfect escape and I couldn't have wished for more. An utterly dreamy start to a series that I know I'm going to fall in love with. ... Book two here I come.  *Buddy read with the bezzie ...*
I will continue reading her stuff though :) Just hope the stories will be better than this one.Spoiler alert ahead!I've watched a lot of soap operas, and this book was just like one.
I think there was just one scene, only one between H and h that didn't end in a fight or in any bad way, and that was when they had sex for the first time (might I mention, the only sex scene in the novel, not including some foreplays that were waaaay sexier than the actuall sex).
I don’t think I even picked up my first modern (not Narnia or LOTR) fantasy until my freshman year of college (The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan).I’m sure that all the Vivian Vande Velde, Robin McKinley, and Christopher Pike books I read when I was a teenager set the stage for the love of all things supernatural I developed as an adult, but for whatever reason, there was a five(ish)-year gap after high school in which I never managed to stumble across anything that could pass as either of my favorite genres today (the aforementioned PNR and UF).And I was so bored.Enter one of my sisters who was always reading the historical romances that she began filching from our maternal grandmother (not the fairy tale-reading grandmother) at WAY too early an age.
2 1/2 to 3 starsI'm glad I read this series out of order (these books can be read out of order).
Personally, I don't think the series was particularly engrossing until after the third book.
Books four, five, and six are my favorite, with book six, The Immortal Highlander, my favorite of the series.
You must, however, read books four, five, six, and seven in order.
I recommend reading the series in this order: Kiss of the Highlander (#4),The Dark Highlander (#5),The Immortal Highlander (#6), Spell of the Highlander (#7), The Highlander Touch (#3), Beyond the Highland Mist (#1), To Tame a Highland Warrior (#2)
Feels embarrassed for reading this.Takes a deep breath.I hate highlander romances!Historical inaccuracy regarding kilts and language, forced seduction, territorial disputes that don't involve geography, unexplainable time travel, TSTL heroines, lairds who have balls the size of an elephant, and smoochy talk that would make Barry White ashamed.I couldn't even get on board with Outlander.
Look at the original cover:There's almost a certain formula for highlander time travel romances:Usually it involves fairies or some weird rocks in the middle of nowhere.
I adored Hawk, but for a lot of the story I was completely frustrated with Adrienne.
I know Adrienne was burned by a "beautiful man", but how can someone be so shortsighted to judge every good looking male for the sins of one?!
I think the story would've benefited by some editing down, as well.
As for the narration, Phil Gigante's male voices are so rich and seductive!
The female voices are another story.
Lydia wasn't so bad, but Adrienne came off as whiny and peevish, and maybe that was on purpose somewhat, but it made me think she was even more of a brat when I already wanted to shake her.
I feel like the Goodreads grouch but as I was listening to this on audio my overriding thought was, “when the hell is it going to end?” It seemed to plod on and on and if I heard the heroine exclaim “I HATE BEAUTIFUL MEN!” once more whilst drooling over two pretty men I was certain I was going lose the last thread of sanity that’s holding me together.
I got the impression that she was a modern girl, who in her past, was treated exceptionally bad by an arrogant, beautiful bastard whom she had a relationship with and from the bits revealed it seemed as if she lived with the man.
Wrap your mouth around that one a half dozen times) aka HAWK, is the 16th centuries version on Brad Pitt, or whatever you consider the epitome of perfect.
okay, so that’s, Hawk.Adrienne is the 20th Centuries version of a ‘man hater’ – she herself is pretty stunning.
And so the story begins.Time travel, romance, seduction, fairies, Rom, danger, action, love are only snippets into what we get in this book.
I didn’t like that to Hawk there was never a question as to if he, himself would go to Adrienne's time to save her; it was always she had to come to him.
I read this over two years ago and never wrote a proper review for it. I've never been a romance fan so this didn't go very well for me. My friend Kate did enjoy the book so you should check out her  review , it might convince you to give this a try!Spread the love people, we all deserve to be famous!Awesome badge courtesy of awesome Kat!************Original review (November 2012):This is not the type of book I usually read but once in a while I feel like a change and try a something different.

I still can't believe how ridiculous this book is and what possessed me to finish it.
I thought that A Knight in Shining Armor was bad but after reading Beyond the Highland Mist I am actually tempted to give it two stars instead of one...
Tengo que reconocer que me ha decepcionado un poco este inicio de saga. No sé, esperaba algo más...
Twentieth Century - Adrienne de Simone has had enough with beautiful men.
Finding herself the pawn in a game between the mortals and the fae, Adrienne is thrust back in time to the sixteenth century where she is to be wed to the man who is the very epitome of everything she has sworn off in men.
Things start getting very interesting when the first time Hawk sees his wife, who he was determined before to ignore, she's checking out the blacksmith, Adam Black.
Determined to not lose his bride to a blacksmith, Hawk sets out to seduce her only to find his every plan thwarted by the not so easily won Adrienne.
So as you can guess the rest of the book is about 'Hawk', with his long dark, sexy flowing locks over his beautiful face, as he tries to breaks the implacable will of his wife, (using the force of sappiness) apparently much like one breaks in a falcon but much less sexy.Part 'Midsummer nights dreams' part, 'Highlander fanfiction' and mostly 'offensive literature that will make you want to smash up your kindle'.
Pues me ha gustado muchísimo... Ha tenido momentos de mucha tensión de la buena (como momento café entre Hawk y Ari ) y momentos de muchas risas. No se me ha hecho una lectura pesada y ya se ha visto que tiene relación con la otra serie Fever. Pues seguiré leyendo esta serie.
Passion & seduction,love & magic,secrets & mystery;This book truly had it all !Beyond the Highland Mist was like an unexpectedly tasty morsel ,I just had to finish at one go!Which I so promptly did ;)I know with all that exclamatory marks,I'm probably coming across a bit unhinged and bouncy,(Is that even a word?) right now but I promise you,it's only from the absolute high this book left me with...A endearing side-effect.

Yet, some things have actually acquired a certain clarity; she is certainly a veteran in writing hot steamy sex scenes and the Highlander series has been, for all intents and purposes, her training camp, leading to the Fever series.I decided to read these books - yes, I was planning to read the whole thing - to fill in the gaps that Shadowfever left me with.
"Beyond the Highland Mist" is the first book in Karen Marie Moning's "Highlander series." Stubborn and lusty Scottish warriors have been a literary delight of mine since I first read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series when I was 19.
The male protagonist, Hawk is a Scottish warrior and laird of the Douglas clan.
Our female protagonist, is Adrienne de Simone, a 20th century fiery spirit who finds herself time traveling to 16th century Scotland.
Of course, sparks quickly fly between the male and female protagonist.
Of course, the female protagonist resists the male's raw sexual magnetism.
I am now reading book 2!
What a sweet romantic book and what a great author Moning is! In the kingdom of Fae, the King and the Queen with the help of the Fool are playing with the lives of two young people Hawk and Adrienne. From the 20th century and New Orlean, Adrienne teleports to the 16th century and Scotland. There, she is forced to marry Hawk, a womeniser who does not really want to marry her. Hawk and Adrienne eventually fall in love.My favourite scene was when Hawk was trying to seduce his wife in the falcons stables, inside the broch.
😍 Ah Sidheach, ah, ne güzel kalbin var senin!Evet, İskoç fetişimin kaynağı da KMM’dir.
Öbür tarafta iki elim yakanda kadın!Şimdi, bu kitap ve seri için Fever karşılaştırması yapıldığına sık sık denk geliyorum.
Ama ben buna katılmıyorum.
Evet, aynı kişi tarafından kaleme alınmış olabilirler ama o kadar farklı kulvarda iki seride bahsediyoruz ki!Bir kere Barrons dediğiniz herif apayrı bir dünya, karşılaştırmak bile anlamsız ulan!
Bu seri Paranormal-Romance, Fever ise Urban Fantasy.
Aradaki fark için bu yazıyı okumanızı tavsiye ederim.
Dolayısıyla ne kadar karşılaştırılmaya müsait tartışılır.
Ha, beğenmezsin anlarım ama lütfen karşılaştırma yapmamaya gayret ederek okuyun.
I don't know what I expected when I started this novel but at the end, it did not work for me at all. Writing was rushed and chaotic, it didn't sit well with me. I really had troubles concentrating on the story and I had hard time connecting with characters.Moreover, the way others talked about "hero" made my eyes roll quite often. "His manhood at half-mast would make a stallion envious." And I just couldn't take story seriously when similar phrases were lurking at me here and there while readin
I don't know what I expected when I started this novel but at the end, it did not work for me at all.
And I just couldn't take story seriously when similar phrases were lurking at me here and there while reading this novel.Beyond the Highland Mist is typical example of cheesy historical romance.
This was my first book by this author and I definitely do not plan to continue reading this series.
Seems that Jamie Fraser has forever ruined me for all other historical stories with Highlanders.
Çeviri ne kadar güzel olursa olsun orijinal dil apayrı.Bu kitap apapapayrı ah kalbim.2. 3. 4. okuyuş. 1. 2. okuyuş ingilizceden.2.yi @Sedef, @Kübra, @Füsun ve @hayledie ile BR yaptık. :)))
Take some Midsummer Nights Dream mix in a little Taming of the Shrew and you will understand why I love this book!
😁💕 This is one of those books that you are reading a long and thinking “This seems so familiar.
🤔 Have I read something like it?” Then you realize that you’ve already read this book years ago, but you loved it so much that rereading it becomes necessary.
😊 So, a little about the story...The Fae Queen is talking about how hot our hero is.
This is a beautiful and passionate love story with a fantasy and sci fi twist.
The worst part is that it was a time where beautiful men were abundant and she is about to land herself the most beautiful of all.Sixteenth C- Sidheach (Sid-hawk) James Douglas is a well known man of beauty, women plot and kill to get into his bed.
“There is not a woman I cannot have” those words uttered by the Hawk are about to be put to the test.Things get all kinds of interesting when Adrienne finds out she is to become the wife of some man she does not know, plus the year is 1513 of course she is going crazy.
This woman is all kinds of pissed.The first meeting between Hawk and Adrienne is hilarious when he catches her checking out the smithy Adam Black.
Feeling quite hungry for some more KMM smut after reading "Burned," I decided to give this series a go. Ugh, it's a debut and pretty poorly written at that. Some seeds of Fever goodness ahead, occasional decent dialog, but overall I wish KMM plotted this one better and avoided the whole lust-at-first-sight nonsense. But I think I will try another, later installment in this series. They seem to get better ratings.
BARRONS ARAMIYORUM, TÜREVLERİNE DE VARIM demiştim ama bu adam bildiğin minnoş çıktı. Senin "kalbim" diyen ağzını... 😻
Pero con el avance de la lectura, terminas acostumbrándote.La autora, Karen Marie Moning, cita varias veces a Shakespeare a lo largo del libro {al principio, entre capítulos} y lo cierto es que toda esta historia de Nieblas de las Highlands me ha recordado mucho a la obra de Shakespeare: El sueño de una noche de verano.
Es verdad que a veces me he cabreado y le he gritado a Hawk ¡vamos, si ella también quiere!!!, pero me ha encantado leer la inseguridad del mejor, el más conocido, la leyenda...
Si es un cuento, si hay hadas, si tienes que leer el 70% del libro para llegar a eso...
After seeing this mentioned on a book haul video a few years ago on YouTube and hearing the words "Time Travel", I was excited to search for a copy to read of Beyond The Highland Mist.
Things I liked about the book:- The fact it featured time travel- The setting of medieval ScotlandThings I wasn't keen on:- The book's pacing, everything happened super quickly.- Adrienne as a character, she was fearless one minute but weeping the next.This is the first book in a series but honestly, Beyond The Highland Mist was just not for me.
It’s the fact that Adrienne just hates beautiful men.And doesn’t that just suck for Hawk?I just love it when the shameless manwhore finally falls for someone who doesn’t gasp and giggle at their every word.
I also love the fact that he is relentless and will stop at nothing to win Ari’s heart.Adrienne was a solid heroine who had a strong will.
What irked me a bit about this book is the fact that it seemed too short.
For lack of a better explanation, I think it was the fact that the scenes seemed so short.
