As a young child, I would lose myself for hours in the simple world of the wood and pond inhabited by Little Joe Otter, Buster Bear, Grandfather Frog, and terrorized by Farmer Brown's Boy. I can remember the very shelf, even the exact spot in the little library in Felton, CA where these books were kept.
I do not recall if Old Man Coyote plays a role in Danny Field Mouse's story or the other way around, but this concept was presented several times.
Charity loved this book.
I found a sweet little 1918 copy of this at an antique store and had to buy it on account of my own Jack as well as our love for Burgess' animal stories. Delightful little read. Strong character was so central in children's literature back then. What has happened?!
My eight year old has been reading these books and has LOVED them. Just as I did when I was little. They are well written and have an engaging story.
The fourth star was for nostalgia, perhaps, but still. See http://www.eatreadandbemommy.com/2015... for more!
very good.
Lovely book to read to an 8 year old boy at bedtime.
