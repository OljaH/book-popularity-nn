I'm not sure if it's because it's older or just the ideas are difficult to grasp, probably a bit of both, but it's a fascinating read and the dense analysis parts are mixed with scenarios laid out to kids and their answers, which is easy reading, so I would call it an enjoyable read for a lay person.
"The bridge isn't supposed to know the kid stole an apple." Another one was they told a scenario to a kid and asked what he thought of that story, and the kid said, "It's pretty."
However, he's a terrifically interesting writer, and I think his historical significance makes him a worthwhile read, even for those with a layman's interest in the subject.I found Piaget pretty accessible, which is why I've given him the high rating.
Piaget presents a terrific critique of Durkheim, who I have a good deal more experience with, and the critique is really interesting.
It does make reading Durkheim a really important piece of material for understanding Piaget's context, but I'm not totally sure that it's necessary.
Piaget's primary focus is on the individual interviews and the psychological causes behind much of the childhood behavior.

Piaget got one thing right: a child's first few years are when his or her mind is most impressionable. This is why early childhood education is so important, in particular for Christians, who so often neglect the very young.
This is where any study of moral development must begin. Foundational book. Assumes away nature, but that is part of Piaget's premise.
