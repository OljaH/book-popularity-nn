و التسرع مفسد لكل الخطط- الناس تتصور المرء و تعامله كما يقدم لهم ذاته و يوحي لهم- الجماهير لا تميل لمن يخبرها بالحقائق، و إنما تفضل من يسكرها عن طريق العواطف و المشاعر الوطنية- تسويق الأفكار و حتى المنتجات لا يكون بطرحها مباشرة، و لكن عبر وسائل تخفي المراد منها و تؤدي لها- من أكثر الفصول التي لفتت نظري، هو الإغواء عن طريق الروحانيات و الكلام العميق، حيث يغلف المغوي أغراضه الشهوانية بحديثه عن معان عميقة، و الحب الإلهي و القدر و الروح و الفن و الأدب الخ...
I can't find the perfect word to convey how awful this book is.
It espouses a completely manipulative style of dealing with other people in which they are all prey to be hunted.
I also believe that I know one of the master seducers who is referred to in the book under a pseudonym, which was terrifying in its own right.
It's not about how to do what I would call "seduction." It's about how to control, direct, engineer, exploit, manipulate, machinate, maneuver, steer and hunt others.
If that's what you want to know, read it, I'm sure it's great.
I was not entranced, just interested and appreciative.Many of the tales derive from high-ranking courtly cultures where seduction and romance were bound by rules of conduct that were strict enough to suggest appropriate behavior but not so strict as to introduce bourgeois guilt or shame into the game of sexual conquest.Indeed, there is no room at all for shame or guilt, only for winning and losing … or perhaps for playing elegantly and still losing, more than winning too easily or in an ignoble way.The attitude to sex is also counter-intuitive to Anglo-Saxon moderns.
I thought it was going to be another annoying "to get him to do this flick your hair." Love this book, it is filled with little inside novela type of things, historical facts, and it has just some of the most interesting people in history.
I love history so this book really did it for me.
I could read it over and over not even for the seductive element but just because it is so good (in my opinion).
Best book I've read in a very long time.
It contains stories about the lives of Casanova, Cleopatra and other Seducers and interesting anecdotes on historical figures.The book is defiantly worth a read but due to it's misleading(Possibly seductive nature) of encouraging it's readers to seduce, lost a point.Worth picking up.A+Edit:On Oct 31, 2018 during an interview with Lewis Howes.
Robert talks about this in his new book The Laws Of Human Nature and I feel like this book is a combination of both research and experience and, a more wise and well rounded yet accurate view of human nature (and therefore seduction) but this book is still incredibly entertaining and well presented.
Since I started reading The Art of Seduction, I've recommended it to just about EVERYONE because everyone seriously needs to read this book.
As a writer and reader, I feel like I have better insight into character relationships, and I want to explore these new things I've learned in my fiction.
Even better, what I learned from Greene isn't only applicable in romantic situations, but in professional situations as well.

This is not your Karrine Steffans vixen manual..This is your comprehensive manual of how to seduce not only men but an entire empire. With this manual I have received a proposal, gained a stalker and experienced a riven heart. It was great! lol
للتوضيح أكثر هذا الكتاب متعوب عليه لدرجة تستدعي رفع القبعة لكاتبة؛ كتاب محترف جداً جداً.
كمية الشخصيات التاريخية سواء كانت من شحم ولحم أو شخوص استعين بها من كتب وروايات رهيب جداً؛ هوامش الكتاب تحمل مقتطفات لا تحصى أغلبها روائية؛ كل تلك الشخصيات والمقتطفات وُظّفت بغرض تقديم مثال لفهم فكره الكاتب التي يريد إيصالها من خلال فصول الكتاب، هذا الزخم فصلني من الاندماج السيكولوجي مع الكتاب وتحول لاندماج من نوع آخرسألت نفسي سؤال أثناء وبعد القراءة هل يمكن فعلا استغلال المادة المكتوبة لإغواء الأشخاص اجتماعياً، سياسيا أو جسدياً؟!!
من يريد فعلاً الاستفادة من المادة المكتوبة يستطيع لكن بالطبع يستلزم امتلاكه ذكاء لقراءة الأشخاص وتوظيف ما قرأ.
This book makes full use of the properties of human desire to your own advantage.Whoever denounces the book of manipulation,immorality, and other such nonsense is under a happy delusion about the world they live in.
Look around you and you'll see - if you really see - under the facade of morality seethes selfishness, manipulation, and other "immoral" intentions and acts.Manipulation is fine as long as the intention is good.
As long as it doesn't end up hurting people for no good reason.I'll stop my diatribe right there.
The point is, the book is highly useful and fascinating.
there's a LOT to be learned from this book about human psychology.
What anti-seduction techniques do you personally exhibit?
I can't decide which book is more interesting and entertaining and thought-provoking, this or the The 48 Laws of Power, the anecdotes from history, the margin quotes/stories are EXCEPTIONALLY well researched in 48 Laws, and they seem not as varied here -- however, the focus of ART OF SEDUCTION is less dynamic and far-reaching, which isn't to say it's less informative.Read them both, they're excellent companion pieces.
A great read. It assumes that you are a liar and manipulator by nature, but once you get past that, it's a fascinating study. Some great annecdotes from famous figures in history make it enthralling in parts.
Really? I mean some good work went into this in terms of historical research I guess...But it so was not for me. It just seemed so silly. Nothing deep or meaningful. It was a tad...silly. And a bit painful to read. I did not agree with most of the points made or categories drawn. Human beings are way more complex than this. No. I would not recommend it. For anyone. I am actually afraid of what damage it could do to a lost mind or in twisted hands.
I have three copies of this. It's endlessly entertaining.
كشخصية "الساحر".بعد أن أستعرض الشخصيات التسعة في القسم الاول و التي جمعت بينها و بين كائنات من المحيط 😄😄 ختم هذا القسم بفصل متميز و نقطة قوة الكتاب سماه ب"الغير لمغويين" 18شخصية يجب ان تجنبها، فحتى القرش و مميزاته لديه نوعية معينة من الفرائس لا تقترب منها، ليس لضعف منه طبعا 😄😄 لكن لانها لا تستهويه و ستكون مضيعة للوقت بنسبة له 😄😄، و من بين هذه 18 شخصية نجد "ملكة الدراما" و "الفج" ، و "السوقي"......هذه الشخصيات يفسر الكاتب بتفصيل خصائصها و كيف تتعرف عليها.لم هذا الفصل مهم 🤔؟ لأن هؤلاء الشخصيات وجودهم حولنا يسلب طاقتنا هم الأشخاص toxique.
'A History of Great Seducers' would have been a more apt title.
500 pages written in the most miniscule font known to man...let's just say it takes a lot of effort.My feelings on it are very mixed.
Greene has clearly put a lot of effort into writing it, it's jam packed with extracts from loads of different books, besides embarrassing pretty much every celebrity the world has ever known.
(lots of skeletons in the closet!)So, if nothing else, it's an entertaining read.
But even so, I feel like he could have been a bit more gentle about it.Basically, it made me rethink every belief I ever had about humankind.If people do this stuff to get their way (and then I think....what about me?!
This was hilarious. Entertaining, insightful, somewhat informative, and absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure there's lots of info in here that's valid and relevant, but a lot of it is a crock that reduces men and women to manipulators and the manipulated. More of a skim through, a what-kind-of-seductress-am-I figure outer, a book to read and compare your own seduction style to and laugh about. Not a book to be taken seriously.
I've spent a lot of time reading this book--which is unavoidable because it's long--and I've come to the realization that this is a classy version of the pick-up artist.The classiness of this version comes from the extensive use of classical literary and historical examples.
Referencing Casanova, Salome, Evita, and many others, Greene does his best work in using these examples to explain how they were effective in their seductive efforts.
I enjoyed some of my time with this book, certainly not all of it.
It provides some insights into patterns of human behaviour that can be useful far beyond what the title and the marketing image implies.
Don't let it fool you though, this is not a self-help book.
With that said, I'd recommend this book especially for those that are working on some form of character development.
It defines a range of seductive (or even highly manipulative) archetypes, with real world examples, that can be very useful for writers.
Two stars for the usefulness of the information provided and one for its entertainment value.
It's tiresome to have everything presented as a "how to manipulate someone into playing your evil little game," but the information is solid and well-supported.
If you're going to be anything other than a hermit, you'll need to use some of the skills outlined here at one point or another in your life to deal with different people.
The point is to use your powers for good, not evil.
A fascinating and well written book, but let's face it, the outlined tactics are those commonly employed by sociopaths.
Deliberately wounding, confusing, stone walling and gaslighting the chosen 'target' will result in at best, an emotionally damaged and highly insecure person.
It's also easy to justify the discarding 'how could I continue with such a emotionally unstable person?'.
But if, unlike the sociopath or psychopath, the would-be seducer does have a shred of conscience, living with the results and also the accumulated karma of such manipulative behaviour, would be highly unpleasant.
All in all a book for the desperate, the unscrupulous, and the empathy-devoid individuals of this world.
I love learning about the psychology of why we like things or why things are popular so that aspect of it was facinating.
It breaks down how movie stars, politicians and world leaders seduce their public.
WHY we are drawn to them or why some leaders are better public speakers than others.
I would like to say it also has sections devoted to how to seduce someone who's already involved or married.
I really enjoyed the sections about how to keep a long term relationship sexy and exciting like it was in the beginning.
The psychology of it all was very interesting.
Lead the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the difference between illusion and reality." You mean like they do to terrorists in interrogation rooms?"Once isolated like this, they have no outside support, and in their confusion they are easily led astray.
Lure the seduced into your lair, where nothing is familiar" Are you trying to love them or torture them for information?Seriously, if anything in this book seems like a good idea, you'd be better off cooking yourself up a love potion or getting some voodoo dolls.

Every woman should read this book. Not to learn how to seduce, but to learn how NOT to be seduced.
In this book, 24 fatal weapons of seduction are being introduced beginning from trapping your victims mentally then getting them emotionally until the Physical intercourse!
The weapons and tools Robert Greene mentions in this book are extremely adaptable not only in personal or communicative use but also in Politics and media !
this books forms a great interpretation of how people are being lured into things they've never thought of being seduced with the techniques he mentions.
After reading this book, Seduction for me is not only a word I hear or I feel using the physical lures.
كتاب هاي رابرت گرين به قدري غني و فصيح نوشته شدن كه وقتي تمومشون مي كني اين حس كه وزن فكريت اضافه شده رو مدام بهت يادآوري مي كنه.خوندن هر سطر از كتاب هاي رابرت گرين من رو در لذت غوطه ور مي كنه.استايل نوشتن اين نويسنده بعد از انتخاب عنوان به اين صورت هست كه هر فصلش رو تشكيل مي ده از جوهره و چكيده اون موضوع كه از تاريخ استنباط شده و هر فصل رو با داستان ها و روايت هاي واقعي تاريخ پشتيباني مي كنه.
