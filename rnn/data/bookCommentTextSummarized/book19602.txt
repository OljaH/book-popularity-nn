So this book has been around for awhile and my sister actually had read it when it first came out and when I asked her how she liked it she said, "It was interesting but kind of cheesy with the internal dialogue.
Despite a bit of cheesiness I thoroughly enjoyed reading how Kyle changes to Adrian, and how beauty is more than skin deep.Extra note: This has almost nothing to do with the book, but every time I would see the word beastly I would think about how for awhile people would say that to substitute cool or awesome.
It's hard to feel interest in characters who are so shallow and dull. An interesting concept, but a book lacking in any real depth or beauty or emotion.
You know those rare special times when the movie is better n the book? JACKPOT! This is one.To be honest the movie is way way better than this.Yeah love may never be ugly,but for sure this book is.As much as I want to talk about how slow this book is and how incredibly boring and how you can't stand it,I don't want to spoil anything.*"CHEESY"*My advice to you is :"WATCH THE MOVIE"
Esta vez lo he hecho al revés, es decir, he visto primero la película que leído el libro. Es más, no tenía ni idea de que este libro existía. Pero me ha encantado. Deseando leer el siguiente.
place that acclaim anorexic models (that look like dead womans walking) as feminine beauty to follow.
No place to moral lesson, so going on with my review, I may say that this book (as you notice reading the title) is a fairy tale on ours moderns days.
After this book if I find another classic fairy tale take to ours days I'll give a try.
Maybe I'll have a great time and fun like I just had reading Beastly.5 stars
Awesome, cute story!!
The book gave more depth to Kyle's character, feelings, perspective of things, and how he saw the world, than I thought possible and I'm so glad for it because it made this an amazing story!I thought this would be a bit boring due to the fact that Kyle was a wealthy news anchor's son, and also that entailed him being snobbish, rude, selfish, vain, unfeeling and spoiled...
so overall a prick and so forth but it was an an intriguing, well thought out book.
Turned out he no longer thought that looks were everything by the end of his story as 'the beast' lol.
I did not expect to like this book as much as I did. It might even be my favorite fairy tale retelling that I've read so far.
Just like with Nerve by Jeanne Ryan, I feel there are too many below average YA books around. This is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. The fact that I already knew the story behind it had nothing to do with how boring this book was. The characters were stereotypical and not worth remembering. The story was boring and predictable. Don’t lose your time with it...
[image error]Desktop Nexus: Wallpapers > Entertainment Wallpapers > Movies Wallpaperwhy does he look like that though??
seriously I think you should read this if youa: like fairy tale retellingsb: are into coming of age, realizing the importance of living type booksc.
I wish it was more modern looking, because the story being told is a Way modernized version of the classis, 'Beauty and the Beast".
I like it a little more now that I have read the book and understand the meaning behind it, but they could have been Way more creative with it!!!!!
“Magic. It was magic, and the magic is called love.”  Beastly is a heartwarming, wonderful retelling of Beauty and the Beast. It is a very delightful read, with the chat sessions, the modern-day setting, the wide range of emotions, lots of references to classics, and tons of roses. It is just perfect. I expected a fairy tale retold, and I’m not disappointed.The story deals with important issues, such as inner values over appearance, abandoned children, parent-child relationships, friendship, e
I expected a fairy tale retold, and I’m not disappointed.The story deals with important issues, such as inner values over appearance, abandoned children, parent-child relationships, friendship, empathy, patience, and love.
Kyle has to reevaluate everything he thought to be right and worth following before: his values and beliefs in life, friendship, love, his relationship with his father, and his attitude toward people as a whole.Lindy appears in the middle of the book.
For example, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë is a meaningful symbol in the book.
I loved the movie too, with all the changes compared to the book.
This retelling takes place in a more modern day world, and starts with our "Beast" - Kyle.
When he plays a prank on the wrong girl he is cursed into a beast and we quickly learn this guy had nothing.
Especially his love toward his garden.One huge difference between the book and the movie is that in the book he is truly a beast (hair, claws, etc) yet the movie adds hair loss, tattoos, scars and metal grafting.
No reference to his chat with others about curses, love, etc.
I liked the Disney cartoon, loved the wonderful creepiness of Jean Cocteau’s La belle et la bête, yet my absolute favorite version of the tale was Marianna Meyer’s Beauty and the Beast with Mercer Mayer’s great illustrations.
However, as I finished it, I was ultimately disappointed.The book starts off well enough.
I also liked Kyle’s growing fondness for his roses.
Ultimately the end killed this book for me.
With those final paragraphs, I found a little sliver of the old Kyle Kingsbury.Regardless, I can see young teens loving this book, especially since it’s been made into a film.

Actually The Little Mermaid has somewhat like a subplot in here, wherein the mermaid, the frog prince and the bear from Snow White and Rose red were chatting to Mr. Anderson.I really liked it but I'm not really amazed by it but I think it's a great retelling and I still looking forward to watching it come to life in the film.
And this is what that makes it an enjoyable book.Kyle Kingsbury is the son of a famous and wealthy newsman, and he also has what it takes to make girls swoon over him - good looks.
At first, he denies the beauty of a rose and think of it as a cheap, ugly flower, but when he becomes a beast, he cares for the roses he planted as if they were his treasure.This story tells us not to judge someone based on their appearance, but rather what they really are on the inside because what you see is not necessary real.
Oh my heart just melted into a gooey mozzarella cheese... ❤ "That's what true love should be like - the person should be a part of your soul and you should know what they're feeling all the time."

is a fun, quick, enjoyable re-telling of the popular fairytale; Beauty and the Beast.Well written, with great characters and a great plot, I finished the book in one sitting and went out to recommend it to anyone who'll listen a second after.The first thing that attracted me to the book was the chat forum it opens with, introducing our main character, Kyle.
. Only Kendra's not a girl - she's a witch, and she puts a curse on him, to become as ugly outside as he is inside.It was lovely watching Kyle change and grow throughout the story, learn the importance of being a good person, becoming someone who judges based on personality and not by how someone looks or how much money he has.
Now yes, I realize that because of his curse, he learned the err of his ways and matured once he was stripped of his beauty and confidence, but if good looks and confidence were his only crime (at age of sixteen) I feel the witch was too flippant with her curse.
Kyle ((IMO)) wasn’t preaching or practicing anything different than what most people want, but he spoke the truth out loud and got cursed for it.So pretty much I think it sucked that Kyle was cursed by the witch because he knows he’s hawt and enjoyed flaunting it.

This was fun..... but I guess I was just hoping for something darker. Happy ending can be such a drag..... LOL all in all I enjoyed the story it just was not what I wanted it to be.
for me the message was as deep as a kitty cool, don't judge people by their appearance is something I learned when I was I kid, and it felt very, very forced in this book, with the dad being awful along with ever background character the one character I loved will who had learned to deal with his disabilly had it cured by magic......he was blind!!
he had learned to deal with it al his life and fixing it like it didn't happen was a step back.
The relationship between the main character was cute and sweet but it felt i little off with how quickly it when.
I didn’t like this book, which is pretty much opposing to how the majority of people felt about it. I loved the idea but it was poorly executed. I found it clichéd, boring and shallow. as a retelling, it wasn't enticing enough. Kyle is still kind of a dick at the end. And I wasn't interested in his redemption story, and I am pretty sure I started skim-reading two thirds of the way through.
it was better then the movie, truer to the original story.
He must fall in love and be loved in return to be transformed back into his true form.We know how this story goes and honestly, other than the modern update Beastly doesn't do anything special.
Instead of the Beauty we get from usual fairy tale lore, our beauty is a shy, sweet, book smart, average looking girl named Lindy.
The ending of this book is no different from any other version, which is to be expected, but at the same time I personally feel like this story could have improved from its average rating.
This is a retelling of the Beauty & the Beast from the Beast's point of view.It's set in modern time
Primero vi la película y me gusto, no sabia que existía este libro, y me ha encantado!!! Y ha superado a la peli por mucho!!!
I enjoyed this new take on Beauty and the Beast.
It was definitely an easy read, I finished this 300-page book within about 3 hours.
The message about inside and outside beauty is a good one for young teens.
I don't really think this book would have been very interesting for older teens, 10-13 year-olds is a target audience.
Having said that, this was an uneven book.
Beastly is recommended by Amazon along with Unwind and Hunger Games.
Unfortunately, Beastly has a long way to go to reach the quality of these two excellent YA books.
I was a little cautious about starting it, but once I began, there was no stopping.Beastly is a modern rendition of a man without kindness changing from the outside-in - the perfect, rich and handsome Kyle who thinks that ugly, or even plain people are not worth looking at, turns into the dark, brooding and lonely Adrian who seeks the beauty of his roses in order to forget about his own hidious appearance.The story being told through his eyes, the reader sees how isolation and pain slowly mend Kyle's soul, turn it to seeking inner beauty and create Adrian - a guy who descriminates between shallowness and true kindness.
But I think this is a good story, well told and enjoyable all the way through.I do have a major complaint about how Flinn handles the disability of one character.
I don't want a spoiler, so let me just wish for more disabled characters who are also whole people, not damaged goods awaiting repair.
And let's hope for more books that flesh such characters out beyond the obvious fact of their difference.
This was such a sharp thorn in an otherwise beautiful story.Update 1/8/2011 - Yep, the movie of the same name staring Vanessa Hudgens, Peter Kraus, and Mary-Kate Olsen is an interpretation of Flinn's book.
Книгата е един съвременен преразказ на една от любимите ми приказки, а именно "Красавица и звярът".
Тази приказка ми е любимата, защото тя разказва, че външната красота не е важна, вътрешното ни аз е значимото, а и да не забравяме и факта, че Бел обича книгите.
Зареди това книгата ми хареса, защото разказва една от любимите ми детски приказки, по един съвременен, забавен и лек начин.
Неусетно приключих книгата и останах с желанието най-после да изгледам филма по книгата.
Книгата не е нещо ново, нещо невиждано до сега, нещо неповторимо, но е лека, интересна и приятна книга.
I truly enjoyed this book - which is no surprise considering my soft spot for fairy tales! I love a good fractured fairy tale, and this was no exception. The character development was wonderful. At the beginning of the story, I truly hated the main character and felt he definitely deserved to be turned into a beast! But I did change my feelings as his actions and thoughts took a turn for the better. I highly recommend this modern day version of 'Beauty and the Beast.'
And I hope it's a whole lot better than this book.It's a remake, modern-take on Beauty and the Beast.
I don't know, maybe some people enjoy reading a book that is kind of a silly take on themes that could be a bit more serious.
I gave it two stars because I liked the whole concept, but in the end, the way the author carried out the story kind of made me want to burn the book, despite every book I buy being like a child to me.One of the first books I would mark as DO-NOT-READ-UNLESS-UTTERLY-BORED
