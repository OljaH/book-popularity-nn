The crux of the book is the work Sacks began in the mid-1960s with dozens of post-encephalitic patients at Bronx's Beth Abraham hospital, then called the Bronx Home for Incurables and disguised here as Mount Carmel.
In a matter of weeks, sometimes overnight, Sacks's patients were "awakened" from what for many had been decades of immobility, incommunicability, and dependence on high levels of nursing care.
Dr. Sacks reviews the cases here of 20 such patients, from their often sudden awakening to the onset and growing severity of side effects.
Few of Sacks patients could tolerate the long term effects of L-DOPA.
un paziente per cos√¨ dire "ideale": nei sei anni e mezzo dacch√© lo conosco mi ha insegnato pi√π cose lui sul parkinsonismo, sulla malattia postencefalitica, sulla sofferenza e sulla natura umana che non tutto il resto dei miei pazienti messi insieme." Ma nelle corpose prefazioni e postfazioni non mancano le riflessioni sul morbo di Parkinson pi√π in generale, la psicologia, la neurologia e la neurochimica, e ancora pi√π in grande sulla medicina tutta e sulla farmacologia, e poi ancor pi√π in grande, con ricchezza di citazioni e riferimenti che denotano la persona colta, fino a suggerire analisi di tipo relativistico e quantico, filosofico e metafisico: "...e questo √® cos√¨ vero che mi meraviglia che la relativit√† e la teoria dei quanti non siano state scoperte dai biologi molto prima che dai fisici." "Tutti questi stati di anacronismo, cos√¨ come altre stranezze temporali descritte in questo libro, indicano quanto sia profondo l'abisso fra l'astratto e il reale, il cronologico e l'ontologico, nel nostro modo di concepire e percepire il tempo." "In quell'attimo mi fu subito chiaro che il parkinsonismo non pu√≤ essere considerato come qualcosa che aumenta o diminuisce per quantit√† finite.

His ability to present the conditions of his patients and their treatment as more than either/or, as more than a list of data points, is what makes this book a classic.
A basic familiarity with neurology makes this an easier read; he uses a lot of medical terms to describe symptoms and treatments.
However, he goes beyond symptoms to see how the patients in his care interact with their disease, treatment, and environment as unique individuals.
Dr. Sack's ability to approach patients as whole, unique beings full of life is the key to his popularity as a physician and writer.
My first experience with Oliver Sachs, long before any movie.
Stumbled across it while browsing a tiny one room library located in the charming community of Vankleek Hill, Ontario where I lived at the time, and immediately became absorbed by the history of the so-called Spanish flu, its effects and the incredible results produced by Sachs' medical intervention.
Everyone should read this to experience the same profound awakening I have, I thought.
As much as I respect Penny Marshall's directing abilities and enjoy some of Robin Williams' work, the movie has to be one of the biggest disappointments of all time, in my book.
In a way, the case studies are richly personal: Sacks insists again and again on treating patients as people, that 'nothing can be reduced to anything' and that 'if we do not listen to our patients we will never learn anything'.
When Sacks reflects on their implications, in contrast, he writes in expansive, lucid prose, linking the mysteries of Parkinsonism to quantum mechanics and to lyrical, existential poetry.This is a wonderful book for writers, because, as often in Sacks' work, it goes to the heart of what forms character, identity, personality.
Eh, this book was somewhat of a let down I thought. There is a marvelous story here, but this book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a clinical write up of these patients, or appeal to the masses. It tried to walk the line between the two and failed. Just as I would get into the story about a patient, a bunch of medical terms about their condition would pop up, I'd have NO clue what they meant, and the enchantment would end. Three stars for the effort, and because the substance is pretty amazing.
Venne rilevato che la sindrome presentava aspetti simili al morbo di Parkinson e pertanto si tent√≤ una cura sperimentale con un farmaco usato appunto per il Parkinson: la L-Dopa, usata per stabilizzare i livelli di dopamina nel cervello dei pazienti affetti dal morbo.I risultati furono interessanti e in un certo senso miracolosi: molte persone trasformate in statue dall'encefalite si risvegliarono, tentando di riappropriarsi del tempo e della vita che la malattia aveva loro sottratto.Il libro √® diviso in due parti: la prima √® "clinica", √® una serie di rapporti su sintomi, attese, cause ed effetti; la seconda √® "umana", e qui Sacks si mostra un medico diverso dalla comune accezione a cui probabilmente siamo abituati.
I‚Äôm going to try to limit my rating to the quality of the book itself and not the events it portrays.
Much of the book is filled with highly technical terms and seems that it was not really written with the layman in mind, and yet often Sacks starts waxing philosophical in a way not suitable for a strictly medical case study.
In the additions written in 1982 and 1990 he seems to have outgrown some of that psychological ignorance, but unfortunately the 1972 portion where it is present is the meat of the book.
Tutti affascinanti i libri di Oliver Sacks, tutti ricchi di umanitÔøΩÔøΩ, mistero, dolore, intelligenza, speranza. Mi piacerebbe conoscerlo di persona.
one of the most wonderful books I have ever read in my life ‚ù§üòç and the movie for Robin Williams and Robert de Niro is a magnificent piece of art üëèüòç

L'ho letto come un romanzo d'avventura, l'ho studiato come un libro di testo.
Che tutto capivano, ma non potevano vivere.
E quando sono tornati alla vita sono stati sopraffatti da una fisicit√† sfuggita al controllo del cervello.
te la vivere sulla pelle e nel cervello.
Per una vita vissuta dietro le sbarre, senza la "consolazione" di stare pagando per un crimine.
Che si porta dietro un carico di sofferenza forse ancora maggiore.
Svegliarsi e sapere che ‚Äì come una bomba ad orologeria ‚Äì si torner√† a vivere come prima, a non-vivere.
Some of them were able to adjust, some could not deal with the changes in the world and in themselves and lapsed back into their frozen state.But this isn't just a sad story.
That was a good movie, but the Robert DeNiro character--as is a necessity when condensing a book for film--is really a composite of many people.
What makes the book so much deeper and richer are the many stories of the patients Oliver Sacks deals with, how their spirits soared, or didn't, what it means to be a human being.
Sacks' writing is as profound as the story he tells.
I‚Äôve noticed there are a lot of books out now about disease.
I don‚Äôt like reading about people suffering because I know how it feels.
I have watched enough people be sick and I don‚Äôt want to read about it.
But this book was very insightful.I am very blessed to have a husband that God blessed me with to support me.
I love you JacobMy Review:Awakenings is a very moving tale.
Very dramatic and full of heart, we suffer with Sacks as he suffers with his patients as they experience an awakening from their catatonic trances after he gives them L-DOPA.
Unfortunately, within a few weeks a large majority of the patients began to manifest new illnesses, the variety and complexity of which are too great for this review.
The story is told through 20 individual case histories presented by the author, followed by a variety of reflections, postscripts and appendices, where Dr Sacks makes the case against a ‚Äúmechanistic‚Äù approach to medicine, and the tendency to treat patients as replicas of each other (the book was written in 1972, so this argument was probably more radical then than it sounds now).
It‚Äôs for this reason that I haven‚Äôt given the book a 5-star rating.
Then in the 1960s Dr. Oliver Sacks began treating these patients with a drug known as L-DOPA.This book contains information about the disease itself and case histories collected by Dr. Sacks.
Sadly, the typical arc for these poor people was abrupt return to motion and speech, followed by such extreme levels of action that the doctors were compelled to withdraw the L-DOPA.
There were just a handful of patients who were able to resume a "normal" life among the hundreds treated by Dr. Sacks.This is a highly technical book and the case histories became somewhat repetitive for me, so I was glad I decided to read the after-matter, including a section called Perspectives.
This was the first of Sacks's books I read, and I had never read anything like it.
The discovery that a chemical could bring 'frozen' people to consciousness again after an apparent sleep of years, was mind blowing to read about - and literally mind blowing for some of those who emerged for a time from the effects of their meningitis and then sank out of consciousness again.
This made for human drama, but lost the scale of the double tragedy.
This is the astonishing true story of a group of people aflicted with a severe 'sleeping' sickness who were awakened for a while by a drug called L Dopa. It is full of personal moments of extreem grief and happiness and wonder. It is a story of clinical experimentation and individual care and understanding.A very good film of it has also been made with Robin Williams as Oliver Sacks. I think, as usual, the book is better than the film, but the film gives a good feel for the story line if not actually much of the detail.
That the condition of Post-Encephalitic patients was not entirely physiological was established by the invariance of symptoms across cases with and without lesions on certain areas of the brain, and it was understood that there were other reasons which played part too (Sacks, 1991).
This is peculiarly interesting because patients of Post Encephalitic Parkinson in Sack‚Äôs book represent a wide spectrum of inadvertent and uncontrolled action, with a low ability of control while maintaining whole personalities.
In any case Post Encephalitic patients in Awakenings have had a history of pathological sleep conditions (Sacks, p.
But I picked up on so many details and so many lines from the movie that I missed the first time around because I'd read Awakenings.
The book I read is a 1990 update, which included more footnotes than the original (according to Sacks) plus offered an update on the patients and his feelings about the movie.
In the movie, L-Dopa is shown to wear off in a way (at least that is the impression I got), and all the patients eventually reverted back to their inert state.

Oliver Sacks' book about a group of mental patients who undergo an experiment goes through a wide variety of emotions, all of which contribute feeling and power to one of the greatest stories I've ever had the pleasure of reading.
This is one of those few books that honestly made me look at life and the privileges those of us "normal" people have with gratitude but also disdain.
The awakened patients in this book become vivid in a wide spectrum during the middle act and make the experience of reading all the more enthralling.
To put it simply: easily one of the best books I've read.
For viewers of the motion picture of the same name or those only familiar with Sacks' collections such as The Man Who Mistood His Wife for a Hat (1985), this book may come as a bit of a surprise. Published in 1973, Sacks was still very much writing as a professional neurologist and had not yet fully found his authorial voice. While still an interesting and thought-provoking tale, this book has much more the dryness, and critical apparati, of the academy.
I really wanted to like this book, but I found it to be overly technical, the writing style to be kind of grandiose, and the story of what appeared to be experimentation on patients that would not fly today pretty horrifying. There were few success stories here.

Summary: Chronicles the experience of post-encephalitis patients existing as prisoners in their own bodies in a trance-like state, who, when treated with L-DOPA, experienced dramatic "awakenings" nearly always followed by debilitating side effects, often resulting with withdrawal of the drug, and a return to their former state.From 1916 to 1927, there was an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, or "sleeping sickness." The sickness often resulted in a period of profound lethargy, sometimes ending in a return to normal or nearly normal life.
While the subject matter could interest a lay reader, it was written in extremely technical medical language, and there were times where I was sure I would give this book only 1 star, if I ever managed to finish it.
Dr. Oliver Sacks writes about his experience treating patients with post-encephalitic Parkinsonism years after having been victims of the great sleeping sickness epidemic at the end of World War I.
While this segment was the most interesting to me, I could not have appreciated it without having the rest of the book.
I could go on and on but will just say: Please read this book if you have any interest in an extraordinary disease and the extraordinary processes which both the patients, other doctors, nurses & medical personnel go through long with Dr. Sacks.__________________________________________________‚ÄãFrom Wikipedia regarding the "sleepy sickness":"Encephalitis lethargica or von Economo disease is an atypical form of encephalitis.
When I started to read ‚ÄúAwakenings‚Äù I was prepared to discover a number of medical cases of patients that suffered from the post-encephalitic syndrome.
We discover Dr. Sacks applying what he preaches: trying to understand the context, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù, of each and everyone of his patients, going beyond just administering x mg of this or y mg of that medicine and waiting for the results.
And he allows us to discover his patients as human beings, by presenting their disease in their own words.The book went through several editions since it was first published.
