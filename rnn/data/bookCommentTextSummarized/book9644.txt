Mrs. Bixby is one of many American females who have found a way to cheat the system by taking advantage of poor men - they marry, divorce and live on the alimony.
Louisa's husband, Edward, finds this absolutely ridiculous and constantly berates his wife.
All it took was one late meal, one meal in which Louisa is happily cooking up a treat for the cat rather than her husband, for Edward to absolutely snap.Pig - A boy tragically loses his parents and is raised by his Aunt Glosspan, who despite being eccentric, loves this child with all her heart.

I don't remember exactly when I encountered Roald Dahl - perhaps in my pre-teens.
But I sure remember I did not encounter him in any story "appropriate" for children.
"The Veld" (not included here) and "Pig" (included) are two stories I remember vividly from those days - both delightfully creepy, yet weirder than the standard fare you get from horror-story writers.This delightful little collection contains creepy gems such as "The Landlady", "Pig", "Georgy Porgy" and "Royal Jelly"; "William and Mary", "The Way up to Heaven", "Edward the Conqueror" - tales of marital revenge with a touch of the horrific; tales of mischief and just desserts ("Parson's Pleasure", "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat", "The Champion of the World") and one uncharacterisable and weird little piece ("Genesis and Catastrophe: A True Story").
Lies, greed, violent impulses… In this collection of short stories, Roald Dahl tells us how the world sometimes exacts delicious revenge on people in the most grotesque ways…I only knew Dahl through his children's books, "The Witches" being one of my own childhood favorites.
The dark humour, acid tongue and unsettling mind that had attracted me to Dahl's children's books shone just as bright here as they did in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Mathilda".
I laughed, winced and gasped a-plenty as I made my way through this little book, and discovered that Dahl is an even better writter than I had imagined!Like any short story anthology, some are better than others.
Though this books of Dahl's short stories is missing some of my favorites (like the one about the eavesdropping card-playing couples and the one with the frozen leg of lamb), it has many of Dahl's best. From a father who feeds his baby enormous quantities of royal jelly, to a nervous hyper-punctual housewife who exacts a seemingly innocent revenge on her passive aggressive husband, these stories are twisted, surprising and never overdone. The stories have just the sort of Professor Plum, crackling fire, pipe in mouth atmosphere that I love to sink into in a rainy day.
Massive chunks of story line are told through every ellipsis, of which there are many.
They may have sinned, have misbehaved, but when their comeuppance comes a-calling, we cringe and gasp as they are served their just desserts.Kiss Kiss also features the short story The Champion of the World, a precursor to his novel Danny, the Champion of the World.
Re-reading the story with an adult edge, discovering where those notions and words were conceived, was like reading Danny for the first time all over again.http://unculturedcritic.blogspot.com
I read this during my english course (still studying english-spanish translation) and even though I recognize that he is an excellent author, I'm growing slightly tired of him.
I read lots of his books during Middle School so please understand....
I loved each plot twist that he made; each story ends completely different from what I was thinking (which is perfect cuz not all books have that).
I read and analyzed this author when I was 15 years old and it's tiring to do it once more and having my final exam with this as a main subject.
An incredibly fun read that I thoroughly enjoyed.
I hadn't read any of the author's work until now, and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.
Although the book is easy to read, it remains fresh and unpredictable.
Pese a ser una lectura rápida, es original e impredecible; e incluso cuando el lector comienza a esperar lo inesperado, Dahl encuentra la manera de sorprenderlo, ya sea a través de un giro en la historia o mediante algún detalle macabro que lo deja sintiéndose inquieto pero extrañamente satisfecho.
An excellent collection of hilarious (and sometimes wonderfully disturbing) short stories. You can see Roald's beautiful writing throughout the whole book, which was a plus for me, as I am a HUGE fan of it. I would recommend this book for ages 13 and up, since there is a little profanity thrown in here and there.  I had a lot of fun reading through this story collection, and I hope you will, too!
I had higer hopes for this book As i really enjoyed Dahls Switch Bitch which is another one of his books written for an older audience. Im sad to Say it really didnt work for mé. I think out of the shortstories in this book i only really liked "the landlady" and " pig". There was Nothing in particular Wrong with the stories they just werent anything special.
I'll write more when I'm feeling more eloquent.April 26, 2014: I finished this a while back; don't quite remember when.1) "The Landlady": 5 stars This is one of my favorites from the book because I think it is a superb example of short story writing.
Clear, but not too obvious with a creative plot twist.2) "William and Mary": 4.5 stars (spoiler alert, though you could tell which direction the story was going in pretty early on).
Well written in the short story style with a solid storyline.5) "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat": 4 stars Much like "Parson's Pleasure," this is another story of karma coming to bite you in the butt.
Average rating: 3.64This was the first set of short stories that I read, from the acclaimed writer, since the time I came to know that he wrote macabre fiction. The book contains eleven stories, exploring the sinister side of the human psyche, some with twists in the end. I enjoyed them, they satisfied me to some extent, although only a couple of stories kept me mesmerized. However, by the end of the book, it made me decide to continue to explore more of his dark and sinister works.
Daha çok çocuk kitapları ile tanıdığım Roald Dahl'in biz yetişkinler için yazılmış sürükleyici öykülerden oluşan kitabını heyecanla okudum. bazi oykulerin sonunda yok artik dedim; bazılarında üzüldüm bazılarında hafif bir tebessüm belirdi yüzümde.cevirinin de cok basarili olduğuna inaniyorum.
Genesis and Catastrophe  >> The birth of Adolf Hitler and his mother wanting him to live after the deaths of her three previous children--supposedly based on a true story.Edward the Conqueror  >> Shows Edward obstinately refusing to believe that the cat Louisa discovers is a reincarnation of Franz Liszt.Pig  >> Vegetarian gourmet cook Lexington becomes a tragic hero by eating a piece of pork and then meeting a death in the packing-house as horribly cruel as it is for pigs.The Champion of the World  >> Shows the easiest and most ingenious way of catching pheasants.
Rating: 2.5/5This is my first 'adult' Roald Dahl, I've never read any of his books of short stories. My faves were Parson's Pleasure and Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat. Some of the stories I didn't like, and one I just didn't get the ending, but some were quite amusing. I also liked how it kept you guessing til the end (well, for me anyway)
I got this book at a thrift store for a quarter. Love the quirky and imaginative stories in this book. I especially like this particular edition because on the back cover jacket is a picture of him and Patricia Neal, a native Tennessean! What a beauty she was! I love her in "The Day the Earth Stood Still."
I don't have the need to judge them all seperately, maybe at some point I will but right now I don't feel like it.
Because of the two/three I knew I don't feel like it.
The others are nice, not everything is immediately described as the horror that is happening (in a way of thinking that is), which I like, it's nice to try and imagine the faces of the main characters when just before they understand what bad thing is going to happen, is actually happening.
I still think that my favourite story is either the first one or The Way Up to Heaven.
I've always believed authors of best-selling children's books are great writers who don't find writing for mature readers challenging enough.
"Kiss Kiss" - a book of short stories by Roald Dahl just reinforces this belief of mine.
With a bunch of fast paced short stories, Dahl shows how to elicit an entire gamut of emotions that can make wake up with a jerk at 3am.
Extremely devious, extremely creepy, extremely wierd, extremely tantalising, extremely sexist too at times.
But whether or not these stories of Roald Dahl float your boat, what you cannot deny the fact that his stories are extremely entertaining.
I never realized Dahl wrote adult fiction, till now I only thought of him as a children’s book author. When I encountered this short story book, I was intrigued and then very pleased. What a wonderful collection of odd and perverse stories about adults who have no moral boundaries and which still hold up today. I will definitely read more of his adult stories.
Re-read my favorite road Dahl collection, and it never gets old. You MUST READ 'Mrs. Bixby and The Colonel's Coat' and 'William and Mary'The master of a twist in the tale!

A hugely enjoyable selection of short stories.Like most people I have read several (and when I say several I mean a lot) of Roald Dahl's books for younger readers and remember thoroughly enjoying them.
I also remember back in my high school days reading "The Landlady" from this selection and thoroughly enjoying it so it was with great excitement that I got stuck into this collection.
A very clever collection of short stories that at times left one using the imagination as to the endings. Written for its times and with that I wonder how a contemporary author would write these stories. My favourites were Pig and Georgy Porgy. Pig is just a macabre little story that made me laugh. Georgy Porgy is a very witty tale about a sadomasochistic sexually repressed vicar.
Dark, macabre and incredibly funny. I knew some of Dahl's children's books, but had never read any of his other work, so "Kiss Kiss" was a great surprise. I loved everything about the stories, but especially the black zany humour that Dahl so perfectly masters. A great collection, and I will definitely go back for more.
I don't often like short stories because I feel like I never get to care for the characters or what happens, but these stories aren't meant for one to care, they're funny and mysterious and awesome. Each and every one seems normal up to a point when everything changes and they're suddenly not. Wonderfully creative and entertaining, Dahl doesn't disappoint in this one.
The "BEST" adult 'short' storytellerClassic. A master story teller with a 'nasty' twist to his plots. I have loved this book since I first read it at school. It might seem a little dated today but Roald Dahl was the master of a short story.
I'd read these before, a long time ago, but they were all brilliant short stories to read again. Dahl was a legend.
Loved the short stories! Roald Dahl swept me off my feet with his sinister, creepy, twisted stories.
And I think I would have enjoyed these stories as a kid, though the endings would probably have frustrated me in a time when I expected more clear and definitive resolutions.The greatest thing about these Dahl short stories (in here and elsewhere) is that they nearly always contain a thread of ambiguity.
I love the little aside when the wife is reading about reincarnation and trying to decide which theories are bullshit and which are true (she decides she doesn't care much for theosophy)."The Way up to Heaven"	Another story of domestic hardly-bliss.
That Roald Dahl could be this shrewd an author came as quite a surprise to me!
I was unaware of the fact that he had written stories for adults and Dear Lord, 'Kiss Kiss', my first book of short-stories penned by this eclectic author shocked me ways more than one!
Don't get me wrong, I abhor bullying of any form and would definitely cry my heart out at what was happening but Roald Dahl makes it possible to laugh at the absurdity, as absurd as this may sound.
That's Roald Dahl for you.
Every story is unique in its own way.
