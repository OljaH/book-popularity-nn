“They have been in prison so long that, if the prison door stands open, they would no longer notice!” It was rather frustrating to have to wait more than 100 pages for the murder to happen, but oh, it was so worth it. Poirot's final dénouement was particularly appreciated. And I'm so ridiculously glad they all had their (view spoiler)[happily ever after (hide spoiler)], in the end.This time around, the queen of crime did not disappoint at all.
Re-read on October 2016I stand by my rating :))***10+++ StarsThis is perhaps one of my most favourite Christie's. No matter how many times I read it (last count was 8), this story does not get old, all those descriptions and sequences retain their power to thrill me even when I read it today. I simply love this book and the mystery of it.This has nothing to do with anything Jerusalem, archaeology, historical artifacts. Nope. Absolutely not.
This is almost like a tourist brochure for Israel and Petra. The plot has a great sinister beginning and in true Christie fashion there are many with motive for murder. In his typical fashion Poirot goes after the psychology of the murderer. However the end is quite dampening and disappointing. Average read.
This is one of my personal favourites.An obnoxious old woman, Mrs. Boynton (who used to the warden of a women's jail) has kept her daughter and stepchildren in psychological bondage for their whole lives: she gets her kicks from exercising control over other human beings.
We will be flabbergasted at the end, when Poirot reveals all, how simple it was.A challenge to armchair detectives: concentrate on the character of Mrs. Boynton, mull over the points Poirot notes down, and try to guess the murderer before all is revealed.
Lady Westholme
All of her children live under her thumb and it is easy to see how her manipulative tyranny make Mrs. Boynton one of the most despicable characters (view spoiler)[and one of the most deserving victims (hide spoiler)] in any Christie novel.Poirot, having once overheard a conversation between two of the Boyton children, is resolved to investigate when a death occurs on a trip to Petra.
At the same time, Mrs Boyton's sadistic behaviour provides a number of lies and deceptions that make it fun to follow Poirot's investigations and keep guessing the resolution to this mystery.

“You are a detective, are you not?”“Yes, mademoiselle.”“A very well-known detective?“The very best detective in the world,” said Poirot, stating it as a simple truth, no more, no less.
Certainly her children, completed cut off from the world until this trip to Jerusalem.
[However, can even we imagine Christie writing a book about a death from heart attack?] [No.]Colonel Carbury smiled and raised his glass across the table [to Poirot] : “Well, here’s to crime.”Indeed, here’s to crime, and an average Poirot performance, which is to say, pretty darned good.
إنني لا أنسى شيئاً أبداً تذكري هذا لا أنسى تصرفاً ولا اسماً ولا وجهاً ..ما توقعت بصراحة هوية القاتل وشكيت بكل العالم 🤣‏
Hercule Poirot and Agatha Christie + Mystery = reader delight and his highlights that point!
يا للهول!كالعادة ألجا إلى قراءة أعمال هذه السيدة الجبارة عندما يعتريني فتور نسبي من القراءة و لم أتوقع أن ان ألتهمها في في جلسة واحدة و لم أتخيل لوهلة هوية القاتل.عمل عبقري و دقيق في كل تفاصيله و لكن لم أستسغ الترتيب الزمني لظهور شخصية المحقق بوارو، تمنيت أن يظهر في الجزء الأول من الأحداث.تمَّت.
3,5⭐ de 5. No soy ningún experta en el género, de hecho prácticamente no he leído historias de este tipo y ha sido una sorpresa agradable. Me ha gustado y sorprendido, la narración es amena y la trama te mantiene enganchado. Me ha gustado mucho el final y no me lo veía venir

Normally, I find myself saying "oh, yeah!" as I read the outcome, but this time I thought it was a little shaky.
I changed my mind a few different times as to the possible outcome, but still didn't get it right!I love that Christie devotes pages and pages of detail leading up to the murder, rather than just starting the book out with the murder then recounting everything that had happened through the various characters' eyes.
Despite what I think may be a lack of evidence to point towards the culprit, I think that anyone who likes mysteries would enjoy this book.
خلاصه ی داستان:در اردوگاهی تحقیقاتی در اورشلیم، خانوادهای به نام بوینتون اقامت دارند که همسر رئیس خانواده، آقای بوینتون که رئیس این پروژه تحقیقاتی باستانشناسی است. رئیس خانواده لیدی بوینتون، زنی مستبد و شکنجهگر است که فرزندانش قصد دارند وی را بکشند. اما پیش از آنکه آنان اقدامی کنند، وی به قتل میرسد. پوآرو که در زمان قتل در همانجا بوده، این ماجرا را پیگیری کرده و قاتل را مییابد...هرکول پوآرو برای گذراندن تعطیلات به اورشلیم میرود و در هتل سلیمان اقامت میکند و در شب اول اقامتش از پنجرهی مجاور چیزی
رئیس خانواده لیدی بوینتون، زنی مستبد و شکنجه‌گر است که فرزندانش قصد دارند وی را بکشند.
ولی بعد متوجه می‌شود که گوینده این جمله را با غیظ و هیجان عجیبی ادا کرد.از دیگر میهمانان هتل، دکتر تئودور ژرار است که یک روان‌شناس معروف فرانسوی است و سارا کینگ که دانشجوی پزشکی انگلیسی است و تعطیلاتش را در ارض موعود می‌گذرانده و مهمتر از همه طایفه بوینتون که بزرگ خانواده آنها خانم بوینتون است، زنی خودخواه و سلطه‌جو که دکتر ژرار او را کابوس زنانگی می‌داند.
خانم بوینتون بر خلاف انتظار به فرزندانش اجازه می‌دهد بدون او بروند و همه از این لحاظ تعجب می‌کنند.
A repeat read. But as decades have passed it was almost like a new story to me. But few hazy memories floated in while reading though these didn't help me to pinpoint the actual killer. I console myself thst I.atleast knew foe sure who the killers aren't. One of the better Christies .Quite recommended .
When Poirot pointed out the real murderer it was rather anti-climatic....I was probably expecting a lot more drama 🤔End of political ambitions and career as a motive for murder.With all the talk of Ginerva's sheikhs coming to capture her and all the pshycological talk between the two doctors present, I was expecting something more dramatic.Well anyway my guess of who the murderer was completely wrong.I was thinking that perhaps Dr Gerald had taken a fancy to the beautiful Ginerva and in a misguided attempt to free her from her tyrannical mother he committed the crime.
So glad to find a Christie book that I don't remember clearly!
An American woman has her family bound to her through psychological torture.
She enjoys tormenting people, and takes it out on her isolated family for amusement.
Though, nobody really cared for the woman, Hercules Poirot does not approve of murder.
But never at the murderer!
My only complaint with the book is the lack of background for a couple of important characters.
Other than this, a brilliant book.
Even without the mystery element, I enjoyed reading about the obnoxious Mrs. Boynton and how she clutched her family tight around her.
“You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?” Poirot is on a little holiday in Egypt, and his poor unsuspecting fellow travellers have no idea that this means one of them, at least, will surely be murdered before the trip is over. As he closes his hotel window one evening, he overhears two unidentified characters talking in another room. “You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?” Poirot smilingly dismisses it – they're probably discussing a play, he thinks, or a mystery novel
There's also a French psychologist on the trip, Dr Gerrard, and it's through the conversations of the two doctors that Christie lays out the psychology of Mrs Boynton for the readers.
For the Egyptian setting, which Christie paints in shades of exotic menace; for the great plot, one of her best; for the psychologically diverse and well drawn group of characters; and most of all for the brooding, malignant presence of Mrs Boynton, a bloated, poisonous spider at the centre of her web, this is a top-rank novel from the pen of the High Queen of Crime.
I don't know why but I thought this was a completely different story before starting.
I've seen this as a play by a different name so - imagine my surprised when I realized I knew this story!But seeing it as a play DID NOT take away from my love for the story.
lol) as always and I loved his little schemes and abilities to notice what others do not.This book is broken into two parts - a before and an after (even the chapter numbers start over!) so the book flew because it felt much shorter and quicker than it was.
Durante una de sus pocas salidas al exterior, a Petra de entre todos los lugares, la mujer termina muerta.
Por desgracia para el culpable, Hércules Poirot andaba también de vacaciones allí (en serio, el tipo sale de vacaciones y el trabajo golpea su puerta...) y decide meter su nariz y sus bigotes en el tema.Este misterio es un poco más simple que otros, y los personajes son menos desarrollados, en gran parte porque producto del trasfondo ya mencionado, los hijos no tienen mucha personalidad.
El epílogo también se siente un poco fuera de lugar, como si Agatha Christie no supiera cómo darle cierre a los protagonistas y sólo escribió un final que le pareció funcional.

"Oh, because - I mean - just because - well - it's so nice that women are able to do things!""I don't agree," said Sarah.
"It's nice when any human being is able to accomplish something worthwhile!
This is definitely not Agatha Christie's best work.
Typically Christie... Unputdownable though I kind of guessed the culprit.
Yine güzel bir Poirot kitabıydı. Şu Boynton'lar da ne tuhaf aileymiş. Sonunun mutlu bitmesine sevindim :D Yalnız bu kitapta Poirot biraz gıcık gıcık konuşuyordu. Ben Poirot'u en çok dostu Hatings'le birlikte seviyorum :)

The first half is spent with two fellow doctors/travelers looking upon the weirdness that is the Boynton family.Two of the characters, Sarah King and Dr. Gerad witness that the entire Boynton family, except for one member (Nadine, the daughter in law) seems to be in a high state of nerves to do the bidding of Mrs. Boynton.
Eventually all parties meet up in Petra and Mrs. Boynton ends up murdered (as one does when you seemed to have taken lessons from the Marquis de Sade) and Hercule Poirot is brought in to discover who murdered the woman.
C.Doyle novels or few others I have read for that matter ,in Christie's the clues are always there from the very beginning .Her masterstroke lies in the ingenious way she hides these clues through out the story .Such is her brilliance that the reader would never know even if the clues are staring right at his/her face ,only to realize when Poirot or miss Marple explains them in the end .That's when the reader is amazed at the author's brilliance .Non the less there is always a chance for the reader to play Detective .This particular book is in every way as brilliant as any other highly acclaimed Christie' novel .Personally I enjoyed this book the most among all her books I have read till date.I loved the cute little love story present as a subplot .I also enjoyed immensely the psychological analysis by Dr .Gerard .But yes ,I was little disappointed by the small revelation in the end because it is unlike Christie's style to hide facts .
Who could ask for more?I think this novel should really be read right after Murder on the Orient Express, published four years previously.
It actually references that novel, and I think Christie envisioned them almost as companion pieces--Appointment with Death takes the premise and the fiendishly brilliant solution of Orient Express, and turns it inside out!
I think the victim here is one of Christie's best pieces of characterization.
But whodunnit?Orient Express' famous solution is, of course, that since everyone had a motive to do it, everyone DID do it.
I usually read an Agatha Christie novel when I am at home on Christmas vacation.
The first Christie novel that I ever read, was "Murder on the Orient Express" - to this day it remains one of my favorite books of all time.
This book, like many Christie novels, had a fairly large list of suspects, however, unlike "Orient Express" or even "Death on the Nile", there was very little interrogation/piecing together the puzzle.
So in short, "Appointment with Death" was a mildly entertaining, fast read, but it lacked most of what I most enjoy about Agatha Christie - Hercule Poirot.
