Einstein briefly introduces the cosmic religion as an alternative to fear and moral religions. There is no anthropomorphic idea of God, it is based on the rational enjoyment of the beauty of the universe. He states that only exceptionally gifted individuals or noble communities can reach this level of abstraction. I laughed, but Einstein isn't at Nietzsche level on this matter. Then, the book changes topic and goes briefly through pacifism, Jewish homeland and aphorisms. It is like a short lecture.
I guess my expectations were too great of The Great man.
Amazing and deep I will have to read it several times to take it all in. I think you would enjoy it.
