And some who would eat them with a fox, in a box, on a train, but not with a goat.Ok. So there are lots of kinds of people in the world.
draws the line.Where people, where will you draw that line?Green eggs and (green) ham is a cipher for our age, an antithesis to the jejune, a whirlwind of growing complexity into which we pour our souls and come face to face with the naked question - will we try them?
Seuss offers us a black and white and green question - do we like them?
It also parallels the generational gap between those set in their ways, and those willing to venture out and explore perhaps a different approach to life.
None the less, you cannot help but continue to turn the pages as you delve into this story, no matter how uncomfortable it may seem at the time.
The main crux of the story relates one man, Sam I Am, trying to please the elderly statesman into venturing into unknown worlds.
The story finally climaxes as the two characters have experienced a horrendous shipwreck, and as they are fighting for their lives together in the angry sea, the culmination of Sam's efforts converge into one page...
I love Green Eggs and Ham. I do!

First let me say I love Dr. Seuss. I just finished reading 'Green Eggs And Ham' with my granddaughter and we really enjoyed it. In short, the book teaches children to try something first before they decide they don't like something. The illustrations are great! I beleve we can all take a lesson from this one.

Another book to read with a child...
here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

BOOKS THAT FEED YOUR HUNGER OF KNOWLEDGE
One of the most charming tales to help kids to learn how to read.A brilliant work made only with fifty words, where forty-nine out of those words are monosyllables.Dr. Seuss, only him.Genius is an overstatement for a writer as him.Also, I think that besides helping to learn how to read,......this funny story helps to encourage kids to try food that they haven’t eaten before, especially since “green” isn’t the most appetizing color for kids in food.So, you have a book that will help your kids to learn in two different fields of their growth......what else can you ask?
I do not think that Doctor SeussShould be a God, like Thor or ZeusAnd if you hate Green Eggs and HamMy Dear, I could not give a Damn
Tautological nightmare Sam I Am is trying to convince our protagonist - unnamed, like so many in Seuss's Kafkaesque universe - to eat rancid food.
He uses increasingly brutal tactics to break our hero down.
Here he is hitting him with a car.Soon Sam I Am will drive the car off a cliff into the ocean - a goat will be involved too, because why not - and here, near drowning, our hero is finally defeated.If this all sounds a little familiar, it's because it's exactly the ending of 1984.Seuss, one of our darkest and most anguished writers, has a fascination with psychological torture.
Green Eggs & Ham uses exactly 50 words.
I would not, could not eat green eggs and ham in the dark!
Mommy: "What did you think?"Mikey: "That was easy, Mommy! I read it so fast!! I like that book. I did a good job, right Mommy?"Mommy: "Yes, baby. A very good job!"Mikey: "I read that one without any help! I want to read it again."Mommy: "Yes you did, baby. Okay, now how many stars?"Mikey: "5 Mommy. It's my favorite!!"Mommy: "Sure baby, lets log it into Goodreads..."(Mommy logging it in, while Mikey is reading the book again. =) Perfect for 1st grade confidence. )
Bennett Cerf, co-founder of Random House and Seuss’s editor, bet him $50 that he couldn’t write a book using only 50 unique words.
Seuss probably didn’t notice, as the book went on to become one of the best-selling picture books ever written (with any number of words).The 50 unique words, in case you’re interested, are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, & you.*Cool, huh?*ON THE ACCIDENTAL ORIGINS OF BELOVED BOOKS by Emily TempleLiterary Hub 3/29/17
An exciting epic story about the battle between good and evil, It really makes you question life the universe and everything.
Until recently only heard orally as passed down from the mouths of ancient sages (my mom and dad), I just picked up this tome and realized the eggs and the ham were green.
However, I must say that is the one failure of Green Eggs and Ham. The negativity is driven home time and again until the reader cries out, "OKAY, I GET IT!
YOU DON'T LIKE GREEN EGGS AND HAM!".
The torture victim submits, tries the colorful culinary conglomeration and finds that he actually DOES like it, and thus is freed from torment!
I had to pick a childhood book for my 2016 Reading Challenge with the Machalo group, so this one wins. Why? I have it memorized. It was required reading for me according to my children so that they would go to sleep at night. Something about the repetitive wording would lull them off to dreamland.

Green Eggs and Ham is really funny and silly and it's also a lot of fun.
I love the message behind it too, it teaches children that they should try it first before deciding they don't like it, in the case of this book its food.
Because we all know how picky kids can be when it comes to food.
What Seuss has created using such imagination, with a particularly dynamic (both flamboyant but simple) and unique style of illustration, coupled with his verse rhythms and the use of repetitive but building and twisting phrases – all in an extremely and deliberately accessible way, is a series of works which are a fantastic visual and verbal feast, captivating both children and adults alike.For me the most memorable examples of Seuss’s work are: ‘The Cat in the Hat’ (along with its sequel ‘The Cat in the Hat Comes Back’) – For the wonderful creation of mischief that is the ‘Cat in the Hat’ ‘Fox in Socks’ – For the tremendously bizarre tongue-twisters‘Green Eggs and Ham’ – For the ever building and dynamic nature of the verse.
Around the same time, I think during the final year or two of the Reagan administration (my memory is not so good), the Reverend Jesse Jackson made a cameo appearance on the Weekend Update segment.
In his voice - with all the authority and suppressed rage of Jackson in his anti-Reagan prime - this book's subversive undercurrent stood out for all to see.
Fifteen or more years later, this remains one of my favorite books of all time.
Bush was re-elected in 2004, I read it again, and for weeks I couldn't get the mantra out of my head, "I do not like them, SAM I AM." NC
I think Seuss is a genius at two distinct genres of children's lit -- the message book and the early reader.
This is the book in which I feel that he best balances the two.
From the message side, Sam teaches us about persistence while his unnamed, skeptical pal learns that one need not cling desperately to an old idea because ideas (like tastes in oddly colored foodstuffs) can change.
But it's also a great example of what a child's reader should be.
It has an engaging plot, but effectively uses repetition of simple, rhyming words to enable the developing reader to begin reading along quickly.
I have to read this twice before I was able to grasp the moral lessons that this children's story book wants to impart to readers. I'm very much aware that target audience for these story books of Dr. Seuss are kids. I can't stop myself on reading them because the colorful illustrations and story are not only enticing, but because all of his books has a hidden moral lesson in them which adult readers could really appreciate.
Sometimes things aren't so bad as we imagine them.
Books like this make me wanna have children.
I should say, when my very strong-willed, don't-take-no-for-an-answer, nag-the-grown-ups-until-they-break-down-sobbing niece and nephew were born, Green Eggs and Ham read like a completely different book to me.
And when I read this story to the kids, I now have a practically bottomless pool of personal experience to draw upon when I give voice to that chattering Sam-I-Am and that poor whatever-he-is, who is just trying to cling to the last disintegrating threads of his sanity!
As an adult, I don't think that there is any other book that speaks with a truer, more authentic voice than Green Eggs and Ham.
WTF?!I understand the moral of the story. I also understand this is a children's book. Doesn't make it less stupid. Good god it was short!
I like the idea that you should never judge a book from its cover.Dr. Seuss way of writing stories in such rhythmic manner to teach kids - and even adults - lessons is really magnificent!You may watch an illustration through here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KRkR...
On the surface, this seams to be a simple tale of learning to like things you never tried. but if you dig deeper, you find a much more sinister manifesto filled with mind control and evil world domination. Yes, I may be treading on thin ice but many have overlooked the subtext and true purpose of this microtome.Be cautious if you plan on reading this book. not many can remain the same once they have peered into a bucket of pure truth.
I was very open to trying new foods as a kid, but Sam I Am actually makes me want to refuse them just because he's such a pushy jerk.
I’ve read this book probably thousands of times and it’s still a favorite of mine. I can recite it by heart, and my children can do the same.
Lots of fun. Loved all the different rhymes, they were cleverly written with how simple and catchy they were, the illustrations were great as well and perfectly depicted the absurdity of Sam-I-Am and No-name's back and forth about the green eggs and ham. Wish I'd read it as a child though, would have absolutely adored it then.
3.0 stars. One of those books that everyone read and loved as a child and I was no exception. What was truly special was reading this book to my five year old daughter and re-living the magic through her eyes.
One of my favourite children's books, so good I have my own copy. I read this to my children and Grandson, over and over, sometimes night after night as bed time reading. Marvellous messages make miraculous moments - there you see, I'm nowhere near as good!!
I was confused at first to why use an unusual color for eggs and ham. The story clearly had a deeper meaning to it but I didn’t really grasp it. It didn’t matter though since I found the rhymes catchy and I couldn’t stop reciting them in my mind as I read the lines.
“Try them, try them, and you may!
Try them and you may, I say.”No hay mucho que decir...
solo que estoy descubriendo que Dr. Seuss es el autor que debí empezar a leer cuando quise empezar a aprender inglés...
Simplemente genial.Nota: Me estoy haciendo adicto a Dr. Seuss
It is tempting to speculate that "clearly" Dr. Seuss meant for the book to be read in the latter context — but ol' Theodore was a crafty fellow and I certainly wouldn't put it past him to have intended the cautionary read either.Interpretations of the text aside, you have to wonder what bad blood there is between our unnamed narrator and Sam I Am. After all, we open with him cursing Sam I Am by name before allowing the platter of succulent (if tainted-looking) green eggs and ham to become a proxy for his ill-will toward that persistent, diminutive foil.
He was into green eggs and ham*; he had a wocket in his pocket (most fashionable)**; he may have travelled a little but as is clearly even more fashionable he encouraged others to travel to imaginary lands***; he described in meticulous detail how an acquaintance of his stole Christmas****; he wrote of another acquaintance's attempt at unauthorised child minding*****; he wrote about vixens in socks******; and he also was not afraid to write about the elephant in the room - imaginary friends*******.
One word of caution I would add though is the need to check children's understanding of the events, it is very easy to get carried away with the story particularly as it suits a fast reading pace, so I would advise asking questions about the story at the end.'Green Eggs and Ham' is a useful story to use in the early years to encourage children to try different foods and could be extended with tasting unusual foods, making different coloured foods ie.
The wording does change, going through the various grammatical options: would you, could you, will not, could not, do not like etc.
It's a surprisingly entertaining battle of wills and for as obvious as the message is, it's a message that all parents spend a great deal of time and energy getting across to their kids ("Try it!
Just try it, how do you know you don't like it until you try it?!"), so it's always nice to have a popular book reinforce it.
The best book of rhyming ever!
Pretty sure Dr Seuss invented rhyming.
The illustrations are like an acid trip, so always a good book to read to your kids.
I've read this many times and it's my favourite kids book.EDIT: just read this two more times to my daughter.
I've read quite a few Dr Seuss books lately and this is still easily my favourite.
During this reading I realised how much my daughter is like the green eggs and ham hater in the book, getting her to try stuff is really difficult.
Loved it! xD <3

Acepto que este es mi libro favorito de Dr. Seuss, hizo que preparara huevos verdes sólo para poder recitarlo mientras los comía. Me encanta el uso del lenguaje de Seuss y el esfuerzo en la traducción porque no quita el ritmo y la gracia de este cortísimo cuento.Recomendado para todos los niños porque el cuento es gracioso y las imágenes hermosas._____________________________________________________Este libro es aún más gracioso en inglés.

Oh that Sam I am always slogging those green eggs and ham around. And the way he insists! I suppose that after a train wreck into a boat with goats and foxes and lots of other onlookers – plus Sam on my ass, I’d probably try ’em too. But not sure I’d like ’em. Even in a box…
I remember when my elementary school served green eggs and ham as homage to this book. I was utterly disgusted. I did not eat green eggs and ham, I did not eat them, Sam-I-Am.
A wonderful, marvellous combination of enjoyment and didactic intent, and highly recommended for both in-class and at home practice/use, and absolutely outstanding for ESL instruction (case in point, in grade four, after my family had immigrated from Germany to Canada, my homeroom teacher used Green Eggs and Ham with me and it definitely made learning English verbs and the many different prepositions much easier and also much more fun to both learn and remember).
“Green Eggs and Ham” is an excellent book for children of all ages, but the repeating verses can be a bit painful to read over and over again if you are not used to reading the same verses over and over again.Dr. Seuss’ illustrations are colorful and hilarious as they show images of Sam-I-Am and the tall furry creature in the black top hat going on outrageous adventures such as riding a car into a tree and then having the car drive on top of a train, while the images follow the repeating verses that Sam-I-Am proposes different ways of eating the green eggs and ham.
I read somewhere that Green Eggs and Ham was written on a dare. Dr. Seuss was dared to write a story using 50 different words or less. Those 50 words have become one of the greatest books in our families library.When I was young, this was THE book I would bring home from school. Every Wed. for 2 months, I would check our Green Eggs and Ham. My mom called the school and asked them not to let me check it out anymore. Now, many years later, I still will pick it up and read it. (even at the library!)
