Tens of millions of people are reading Potter and Twilight, not because the books are well-written or interesting, but because the readers have been manipulated into buying them by the Napoleons and Squealers of this world.
I know I have specific reviews for each of the books, but I just wanted to add a general review, especially for those wondering what people, especially adults, see in Harry Potter.
Maybe it was because I was seeing the story through his eyes or that I wasn't expecting much from children's literature but I was surprised to find how entertaining and well written these books were.
The second time I read the series I couldn't just see Harry's light-hearted experiences, but Dumbledore's careful hand as he guided and prepared this boy for a mission in life that not many people could handle.
I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about why the  Harry Potter series is so damn good.
Harry receives an invitation to a school of magic, a world of wonder, and to quote Roald Dahl‚Äôs Willy Wonker, ‚Äúa world of pure imagination.‚Äù Despite his rough upbringing, nasty experience with several bullies, his awful tutelage in potions class, and living in constant fear of an evil sorcerer who wishes to murder Harry and all his friends, he actually has a brilliant time at Hogwarts.
I‚Äôm going to be posting individual reviews for each book in the series at some point soon to explain more in depth things, and exactly what I like about each book.
So here we go:I am a member of what I'll call "the Harry Potter generation" - ie, I was a kid when these books first came out, and I've literally grown up with the series.
Writing reviews of the books as I read them strikes me as a pointless and overly time-consuming job, so I decided to try something else.
Aparecium! How to choose a single book in the Harry Potter saga? How to choose a part of something that needs each part to generate the expected impact? I was precisely trying to choose one book to use as example in my "favorites" virtual shelf but I realize that not matter which book would I chose, it would feel "incomplete". So I think that the better way is to add this complete edition including the seven novels to use it in my "favorites" virtual shelf.The rating to the collection is basica
Truly magical experience where J.K. Rowling, the author, was able to merge such fantastic world with wizards, witches and other paranormal beings with the real experience of parents and kids when they are going to school, needing to get school supplies, books, equipment, etc...
Not only it has a truly well crafted mystery but also, you will amaze to realize how a lot of elements presented in the previous books are explained the reason of existing here in this novel and all is turning around of a character.
I felt the need of taking away a star just because to reflect the high levels of stress that I suffered while reading this book.
XD)So I just re-read & re-read HP from the beginning to the book recently had come out.) that's why I say: I'm a professional re-reader.üòÅ & I love re-readng, because those stories never get old for me!I loved with HarryI laughed with HarryI cried with HarryI felt like Harry (about characters & situation)I was excited with HarryI was angry with Harry& I was scared with HarryYou probably ask:"After all this time?"& I reply:....."Always.‚Äù even though I know almost every sentences & events & I know how it ends!one of the best series I've ever read.
A truly seven masterful works of fiction..Some Harry Potter Facts:
I am an absolute Harry Potter fan.
I picked up the series when I was in college and was blown away by this mesmerizing and page-turning "children's book".
J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius.
In fact, the world Rowling creates in Harry Potter is so real that I often find myself - and this is scary to admit - believing I can do magic.
This will definitely be a series I enjoy throughout my lifetime, reading them both on my own and with my children.
In fact, I love Harry Potter so much, that I named my car "Hermione" and have a picture of Emma Watson hanging from review mirror.
Complete Harry Potter Boxed Set = Harry Potter Boxset (Harry Potter #1-7), J.K. RowlingHarry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J.
The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and muggles, a reference term that means non-magical people.ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥ ŸÖÿ¨ŸÖŸàÿπŸá ⁄©ÿßŸÖŸÑ Ÿáÿ±€å Ÿæÿßÿ™ÿ±: ÿßÿ≤ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 1997 ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€å ÿ™ÿß ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 2008 ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿß.
No books have influenced me the way the Harry Potter series has.
All I know is that these books came into my life and lit up my soul in a way that I never knew was possible.
Years and years later, I still re-read them and sink into that world and I just feel so alive.
What are you possibly doing with your life that you've postponed for so many years the reading of the best series of the century?
The biggest thing for me was the world Rowling created and all the imagination that went into it.
I remember reading the first book and thinking, "Rowling presents a new invention on almost every page!" Imagine how long a list would be of all the imaginative elements she used in this series.
But this isn't the whole reason why the series was a phenomenon--there are other excellent books out there which get only a fraction of the amount of attention.
I think one big reason is because it is a seven-book series.
I wish it wasn't over! I love Harry Potter.
EPICI feel the need to say THANK YOU. Thank you very much for giving the world this wonderful story.THANK YOU
For one, I love Hogwarts and this whole magical world that JK Rowling has so graciously brought upon all of us who has read this series.
In short, it was a fantastic and magical escape from this maddening world we're living in.I know I am no writer that could convince everyone of how amazing the harry potter books are, in the end it still is up to the reader.
So thank goodness JK Rowling's left us with words that I hold dear in my heart and I know I would remember whenever I miss Harry Potter...Because once a Potterhead, ALWAYS a Potterhead.
There's the Series Of Unfortunate Events, and the Spiderwick Chronicles.
It makes me excited to stock my (at work) shelves with the Chronicles of Narnia and the Dark Is Rising series.And yeah, I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter, too.
ICSE Board schools in India to include Harry Potter as a part of their English syllabus. Take me back to school, please!!! *fangirling hard*

You know those annoying kids who go to the movies to watch any Harry Potter movie at the earliest hour possible, dressed in hogwarts robes, speaking with a British accent and claiming to be in Gryffindor? Or those kids who immediately jump into a conversation involving Harry Potter and inform everyone of all they know on the topic? Yeah, well. I'm one of them.
I wanna go to Hogwarts!
After reading Harry Potter, I realized how different they are.
Rowling prose is agile, fluent, easy to read yet beautiful and detailed enough.
I've never read any other author who can balance both aspects so well without finishing with a bunch of flat characters and a too foreseeable plot.
Harry Potter would have not appealed to me so much to if there were seven Philosopher's Stone-like books.
It's the Harry Potter generation: kids who grew up with him.
I'll answer that she must have done something right if she can keep me reading until 3AM (believe, it's not easy).

The read, an adult perspective (peaking over the age of 40), my view book by book
This book feels a bit childlike, and I'm wondering why am I here, when there are so many adult books for me to read?
The Chamber of Secrets : The series is picking up, I see growth in Harry, but It still feels pre-teenish, yet, it was a nice solid plot.
Another touch of adult romance, Fleur I loved when she said..
I expected to miss my adult books.
Here's the story of how I became a fan of HP: I am an avid reader and years ago, when the Harry Potter books first came to the U.S. and caused such a sensation, I resisted reading them.
It was as a mother of two cranky children that I ended up trying the books, and I am SO glad that I did not end up missing out on this brilliant and wonderful series.My kids and I were in an unpleasant rut.
I became known as the Harry Potter expert (and the books' biggest fan) at my school.
(Sidebar, I haven't had the slightest desire to actually read these past several months; audiobooks have become my solace lately.)As someone who only saw the movies--never having grown up with the books since I wasn't a reader as a kid--I was surprised how very few differences there were between the books and movies.
The books felt like much more in-depth and immersive experiences while the movies were the equally gorgeous yet more condensed visual counterparts.There's really nothing else I can say about a series that has achieved such legendary status.
This series is the real deal.And Rowling is most definitely the real deal.
i was brought into the harry potter world after the second book came out.
i loved the third one because harry started to really step into his role and there was so much happening.
it was so great to see harry start to step into his role as a leader and fight against voldemort.
i loved the sixth because we finally were able to see into the life and rise of voldemort.
i especially loved the first six books because no matter how i tried i could not guess how they would end.
I felt sorry when the series was completed but i admit that it was the right thing.Lastly, we should never forget that J.K.Rowling introduced many children into the magical world of books and that is the greatest achievement for a writer!

I used to LOVE harry potter, obsessively.
When i read this and i think of all the great stuff about this fantasy, i remember how much i HATE being a grown up.
I cant understand why some people are being mean or asking me about weird grown up stuff, like paying the bills, or dating, or being responsible for a parking spot.
Funny how this gets the best of me cuz harry potter reminds me of childhood excitement.
When they were choosing characters for the harry potter movies, i was the exact same age as emma Watson (i still am
