What a brilliant book!
This is the first ever biography of Marx, originally published in 1918 under German military censorship.
Of course, Mehring worked without much of the material (most importantly, the Grundrisse manuscript) available to later biographers, which affects his interpretation of Marx's scientific work.
But this is balanced by an intimate knowledge of the workings of the International, often lacking in later works.
If you should read one biography of Marx, this is not it.
But if you've read others before, Mehring's book is an indispensable addition.
