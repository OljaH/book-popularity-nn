I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this book. It's a simple story, but it really pulled me in and I developed a great affection for the characters. Readers should remember the time frame in which it was written. I had a few "ouch" moments when characters said things that we would consider rather sexist or racist. Many thanks to the Librivox narrator for her excellent reading. I loved her accent, even though it meant I couldn't quite catch every word.
Captain Jim is set in England during World War I.
Norah and her father have moved to England to be in the same hemisphere as Jim and his best mate Wally who have enlisted of course as loyal sons of the British Empire.
While the two lads are at war, Norah & her father acquire a country home & open it as a convalescent center for soldiers who need it.
Like Rilla of Ingleside, Captain Jim is a book about World War I from the viewpoint of those from the Empire's nations who supported Britain in the war.
I'm not sure how this made it onto one of the lists of classic books I have but it doesn't belong there. The story was entertaining enough and I even shed a tear at the appropriate time but it wasn't something to be preserved for the ages. Perhaps good for a glimpse into the lives of those in England during WWI but not much more.
