Possibly the book I have read the most in my life. Troy, the man I hold all men up to, hence my horrible track record. Sigh... I love me a tragic hottie!
This is one of the most romantic stories I have ever read. the character of Troy keeps me coming back to this book again and again. I love the characters, I love the setting, I just really love this book. Best in the series.
C. Andrews' Casteel series is a so-so gothic soap opera book with Ms. Andrews' usual settings: a beautiful poor girl with a questionable parentage, the girl moves to her rich grandparents' mansion, handsome love interests, love triangle, wicked older woman ((view spoiler)[the grandmother (hide spoiler)]), seemingly friendly older man who may have ominous intention toward the heroine ((view spoiler)[the grandfather (hide spoiler)]), jealous sister/stepsister, kinship which is twisted and corrupted by money, mention of rape, attempted rape......and last but not least, (view spoiler)[incest (hide spoiler)].
I mean...(view spoiler)[not only Heaven and Tory turns out being related, Heaven also accidentally causes the death of her younger brother Tom, and all the dramas about Heaven's attempts to pawn her younger siblings and niece away from their adoptive families.
Tony, Jillian, The Casteel family, even Rye Whiskey and Curtis all hold a special place in my heart.Novels that were truly written by Ms. Andrews were Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, My Sweet Audrina, Heaven, and Dark Angel.
When Virginia became seriously ill while writing the Casteel series, she began to work even harder, hoping to finish as many stories as possible so that her fans could one day share them.
Beginning with the final books in the Casteel series they worked closely with a carefully selected writer to organize and complete Virginia's stories and to expand upon them.
It's sort of described, but I swear, Heaven Leigh Casteel, after living there for, what, two years, I think she only ever visited her bedroom, the kitchen, the dining room, Jillian's room, and Troy's cottage.
After the life that Heaven lived before arriving Boston (minus the two years with the bi-polar Kitty and lame-noddle Cal Dennison in Atlanta...oh, just go read Heaven first!), I thought she'd invite every homeless person in the city to come over, eat a hot meal, and maybe take a frickin' shower or something.What does she do?
She intends to shock the locals but especially her mean-spirited pa, but instead, she confuses him while he is helping with the lions, which go out of control, leading her brother Tom, wearing a clown's outfit complete with red wig, to courageously go into the lion's cage with a gun, and though he saves others, he is mauled to death.See?
And when you're done with him, run to Jill and destroy her!
And when you've finished off everyone in Farthy, run to your father and ruin his life!
Ruin Tom's and Fanny's, and don't leave out Our Jane and Keith!
You were an amazing writer, V.C. Andrews.
Pretty darn trashy. I read it when I was very young though, so I loved it. Troy and Heaven were awesome, even with the weird incest twist and dramatics. Still, it made my pre-teen heart flutter.I was a weird child, but it wasn't that unusual -- there were a lot of us under-aged V.C. Andrews readers back in the day.
Nors jos senelė Džilian jau 61-erių metų dama, atrodo ji pritrenkiančiai.
Jos vyras Tonis nėra tikrasis Heven senelis – tai antrasis Džilian vyras.
Deja, Džilian ir Heven santykiai labai šilti neužsimezga – senelė nuolat baiminasi, jog kas nors supras jos tikrąjį amžių, sužinoję, jog Heven yra jos anūkė.
Nors pirmoji jos meilė Loganas ją skaudžiai pametė, savo širdies žaizdas Heven pamažu išsigydo naujos meilės pagalba.Jeigu pastebėjote, dabar paauglių tarpe populiauriausios tos knygos, kuriose pasakojama apie jaunuolius sugebėjusius neįmanomai sunkiomis sąlygomis išgyventi, kovoti, mylėti ir išlikti dorais.
Jos buvo pirmos tokios apie paauglių, vėliau suaugusių žmonių sudėtingus likimus ir supainiotus gyvenimus.
There were multiple instances when the main characters would do things that made absolutely NO sense, and I would read these passages thinking, "WTF?
But then later the reader discovers that she had to get rid of it in that way so that the mean girl can land in it after that lame initiation thing.
And did anyone else realize that he was completely healthy for the ENTIRE book until suddenly his "secret" is revealed and he's ready to join the land of the happy- then...
The Heaven series is definitely my favorite from VC Andrews.
One of the better VCA novels.
Heaven was kinda bitchy in this one, but overall I like her.
I can forgive the knee-jerk reactions to posh millions vs impoverished memories; for much of the book she's only 17ish, & that's not the most brainy time of our existence.
Her final scheme o' revenge with the dyed hair & her mom's dress, though...wtf.
:D Even Cal makes a cameo.
Stupid mimbo Cal.
😈 He makes artsy-tragic toymaker Troy look like Captain America.
The writing was clunky at times, but not awful.
Therefore: the VCA/Dan Ross Special Needs Rating Scale dictates 4 stars.
when i first started reading the heaven series i believe i was like 13, and i fell in love with it.
its 5 years after and i really wanted these books on my shelf to let my children read it when they're older so i went on a treasure hunt looking for the whole series.
i finally found the whole series in the old, small seondhand book store i adored!
im sooooo HAPPY to add this book in my collection.
oh and if i were to have the perfect husband Troy would be #1 pick...
<3 <3 <3 <3 My favorite romance book ever!!
While I almost love Heaven as much as this one, it's hard to compete since this one has a rich boarding school filled with mean girls, more mystery concerning her mother's past, and of course, the introduction of Troy Tatterton, the hedge maze, and his adorable cottageFor a hilarious, spoiler filled recap, I highly recommend going here: http://casteelkidsstolemygroceries.tu...Setting:This book is mostly set in Boston, at a huge gothic mansion called Farthinggale Manor, though there is also a hedge maze, Troy's cottage, stables, and an old barn near it.
(Rating based on my remembered feelings when I read this book as a 14 year old.)
I thought that I would like Heaven better than Dark Angel.
Heaven even meets a man named Troy.
Oh, finally Heaven has met a man who isn't abusive like all the other men her life.
The middle is just basically a cycle of Heaven seeing her siblings, seeing Logan, thinking of Troy, repeat.
It really shocked me when Tony was so acceptable of Troy and Heaven's engagement.
So Troy is Heaven's uncle.
He is gone for YEARS.
Troy dies.
Heaven needs Tom so much.
PEOPLE!!!!It seems as if Heaven and Logan have decided to reconcile.
Logan has treated Heaven so poorly.

I loved Heaven's burning need to prove herself, the fact that she wasn't perfect, for all that she's worshipped by others.
Her struggle with her upbringing and her father and her love for Troy were all very touching.
And that's the thing with VCA's originals, no matter how ridiculous they can be, they are touching, perhaps powerful, at a push.Only, I really really really really fucking hated Logan.
I really really really hated him.
I don't care that Troy was her uncle, he was still the better choice by far.Also, I ended up feeling really bad for Tony, for all that he was...
probably a really bad man.
O segundo livro desta saga é ainda melhor que o primeiro...
a continuação da história de vida de Heaven, que vai viver com os avós maternos numa luxuosa mansão.A estranheza inicial de viver com tanto luxo, ao qual não estava habituada, depressa vai dar lugar a um novo estilo de vida e a uma nova forma de encarar as agruras do passado.Mas é impossível esquecer a vida nos montes, pois é aí que tem as suas raízes...
no meio da trama continuam a aparecer personagens fortes e apaixonantes e revelações que nos vão deixar deveras surpreendidos e em estado de ansiedade para ler o próximo volume.A leitura desta saga é realmente viciante!!
Despite the fact I did enjoy reading this book, I consider it my least favorite of V.C's books. This was written by VCA herself and I felt she could of done so much better. The first book, Heaven, was amazing but Dark Angel wasn't nearly as good or satisfying. Everything here felt rushed, Troy was way too angsty for my taste and the circus thing seemed completely random. With all that said, it's still a good book just lacking V.C just wasn't at her best with this one in my opinion.
This is my all time favorite VC Andrew's book and I reference it in a novel I'm still working on. I loved the love story between Heaven and Troy and made this book a page turner to find out what happened between them. I passed my collection of VC Andrew's books to my little sister because I enjoyed them so much when I was young.There is a lot of darkness and pain in this series, but for me it surpassed Flowers in the Attic.
VC Andrews has always been a favorite of mine since my childhood days. I have read (and re-read) all of her books, and although I am much older now and find that some of her work is better than others, I still enjoy the twists and turns, strangeness and mystery that continues to captivate my interest.
another one of my favorites. For some reason, I loved the Heaven/Troy relationship so much (minus the incest) that I wrote a couple stories about them!! How embarrassing :) Anyway, another book that I will never forget.
I read this book thirty years ago when I was 13. I love loved it. Not as much now. But that's ok it just made me wonder how I interpreted some of these situations so young, and why was I reading smut.
I was about 13 years old when I first read this book. I read this book in one day and I fell in love with the character Troy.
I loved this book, especially Troy. Tony was a bit creepy though.
Heaven is taken in by her mother’s family and begins living in the opulence of the upper class, though she is still determined to reunite the family that her father split up all those years ago. Here she meets Troy, the toy maker, and her life begins to change in more ways than she expected.
J'ai été très émue par le sort de Tom même si encore une fois, j'avais bien senti que l'idée de Heaven n'était pas des plus judicieuses...
La fin a été pourtant une surprise pour moi et j'espère que Heaven va réussir à pardonner...Ce que j'aime : l'ambiance glauque et les secrets de famille.
L'héroïne attachante, le fait de revoir Jane et KeithCe que j'aime moins : l'attitude de Fanny, le sort de Tom et la relation d'Heaven et Logan qui me gonfleEn bref : Encore un excellent tome qui nous permet de percer peu à peu les secrets des Casteel et des TattertonMa note8/10
I loved the characters, the setting and the array of dramas that occurred in the life of the Casteel children.
I was unable to anticipate/predict what would occur in the Casteel children's lives before their dramas were presented in the book.I admired the strength and determination of Heaven.
It was a real surprise.There was a lot of sad events in this story, particularly towards the end of the book and at the end of the book.
The sad ending was a result of Heaven's actions, however, something positive also comes out of this disaster which changes the way the Winnerrow community view the Casteels.
I am just sad that Kitty destroyed Leigh's doll in the previous book, but Heaven should have confronted Tony about it, it wouldn't have hurt to press the issue (especially after finding out what Tony and Leigh had done) More of the doll's origins are revealed in the fifth Casteel book, 'Web of Dreams', but it still would have helped this story to see Heaven ask Tony about the doll and seeing how he reacted to it.Heaven's idea to screw around with Luke's mind was a great idea.
After the mistreatment he gave her, he deserved it though I felt bad about what happened to Tom. Tony's revelations about Leigh are shocking, but the truth is revealed in future Casteel books, so this makes a good installment in the series.
Overall a decent continuation of Heaven Casteel's story.
This is all about getting revenge after all.
That is what Heaven wants after all — to prove that a girl who grew up so poor can succeed in this life.I've got nothing bad or ill to say but since she deserves a better life anyway.
Besides, she's not that selfish and that's better.
There's only one thing that she can't always get though: love.Regardless, the novel's ending is quite promising.
She has a chance with love after all the struggle and disappointment she had experienced.
Let's see what happens in the next novel of this series..
