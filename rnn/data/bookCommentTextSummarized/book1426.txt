A very good introductory book for students of English literature. Starting with Old English and ending with Modern literature, it is well-written, moderately detailed and systematic in its approach to dissecting literary trends and aesthetics.Covers in a very lucid manner all the eras, their cultural/political background as well as literary aspects of notable authors and works, while also mentioning lesser authors/works. A clear, brief account of cultural as well as chronological history. Supplemented by A Glossary of Literary Terms, it would be the perfect reference book for students.
An immensely lucid, systematic book detailing the history of English literature right from Old English to Modern English - provides necessary background historical and cultural context to understand the trends of a particular era in terms of its literary output - as also discussing in brief but with immense clarity major authors and works of respective eras and a brief mention of minor authors and works.A must-read for students, very useful for those interesting in tracing the growth of English literature.
Wonderful insight to writing skills covering the period starting from Chaucer- 14th C. BC till Morder Writing from late 19th Century to 20th Century.Beautiful writing description, and the works of writers, their prolific writing styles is what would mesmerize one with the Epoch / Period.Would love to read once again, being Literature student, knows the beauty of it, of every genre and skills.
