Not really a 4 star book unless you really like ERB & the Barsoom series. This is one of the best in that series.
In hindsight, the parodic elements were certainly present: three strange lost/hidden/secret cities, each with strict "no leaving" policies; a damsel in distress that appears apparently on cue; yet another poor deluded maid who falls head-over-heels for John Carter in time to render assistance in escape; and a seeming conga-line of swordmen (each claiming to be the best of Barsoom) for Carter to dramatically and extravagantly crush.
I would like to know more about the nearly-abandoned secret city of Horz, its inhabitants dwelling within a hidden citadel against discovery by Green Martian raiders, or more development of the dastardly Hin Abtol, whose mad dreams of conquest drive him to lead a ragtag, disloyal horde of scavenged, obsolete warships against the city of Gathol from the greenhouse city of the polar region.

Finally, in "Invisible Men of Mars," Carter and his granddaughter, the eponymous Llana, come upon the lost city of Invar, and its invisible inhabitants.
And in addition to previous events being referred to, we also see, in "Llana of Gathol," the return of several characters from earlier volumes: Ptor Fak from "A Princess of Mars," Tan Hadron from "A Fighting Man of Mars," Zithad from "The Gods of Mars" and so on.
How is Carter able to read the hieroglyphs on the king's crown in Invar, when in previous books Burroughs has told us that each city has its own written symbols?
And yet, as with all John Carter novels, it possesses a certain kind of charm for anyone reading it for purely escapist reasons.LLANA OF GATHOL is composed of four inter-connected novellas, each with the same basic story structure: A strange new city is discovered, Llana is taken prisoner, and John Carter must break free from his captors and rescue her.
Every new city that John Carter visits has its own unique and fascinating characteristics--the kind of settings that would've made for great episodes of the original STAR TREK.Though recommended for John Carter fans only, LLANA OF GATHOL is the sort of ultra-lowbrow entertainment that keeps you coming back for more.
Probably the weakest of the Barsoom series, as Edgar Rice Burroughs resorts to a bit of parody of hi
In this penultimate novel in the John Carter series, our hero discovers still more unknown tribes on the red planet. The evil Hin Abtol, self described Jeddak of Jeddaks in the north, is bent on conquering all of Barsoom and claiming John Carter's grandaughter, Llana of Gathol in the bargain. From the lost city of Horz, to a tribe that has created a pill to make themselves invisible, John Carter fights his way back to Helium with Llana in tow, meeting steadfast companions along the way.Another in an always enjoyable series.
This tale of Barsoom opens with an unidentified narrator relaxing on a Hawaiian beach, with one of his kin, John Carter, coming and telling the story of the titular character, Llana of Gathol, daughter of Gahan of Gathol and Tara of Helium.
The company ultimately flies to Gathol, although they’re at first unwelcome due to posing as emissaries of the Black Pirates.Carter goes by an alias throughout the story, although he does occasionally tell his true identity to a select few characters, and takes odd jobs such as thawing and reviving human corpses in the northern city of Pankdor.
Normally, I'd put aside books from a series until I have read the previous ones, but sometimes I get a sense that the story is less serialized, and that letting myself skip ahead a little won't be a big deal.
Coming in without knowing his style whatsoever makes it difficult to enjoy a parody the way it was intended.
I still can't give it a higher rating, as I really can't say that I enjoyed it, but I dug this pit, the least I can do is stand in it.It may be that by reading this I have made it impossible to ever enjoy another book from this series.
It's hard for me to rate this book. It is divided into 4 sections. The first was arguably my favorite sequence in the entire series. The 2nd and 3rd were good but the 4th was very bland and disappointing. Had the book ended differently I think I should have enjoyed it a lot more. It's still a fun and very fast paced read.
If you like John Carter you'll like this.Like Catholics was main character in Thuvia Maiden of Mars, John Carter is main character of Llana. In fact Llana is a minor character unlike Thuvia. She was the reason for the stories. In that it is similar to other John Carter stories.
John Carter is captured while seeking to rescue his granddaughter Llana. In the first (of 4) part, he is taken captive in the dead city of Horz. And it goes from there.
Fun penultimate book in the Barsoom series and the last one, wholly acknowledged, as being penned by ERB himself. Very much enjoyed it.
John Carter goes gallivanting alone on some half-baked adventure because...
Gets himself captured and enslaved because...
Runs into his granddaughter (Llana) because...
Reasons ensue.Granddaughter had been kidnapped and enslaved, and Carter had no idea until he stumbled across her by accident in some storage closet.
Grandfather-of-the-Year loses her at least three more times before finally getting her home.
That's a rarity in these books.This collection of novellas doesn't really bring anything new to the world of John Carter, and all four stories pretty much follow the same tired tropes.
Yet another example of hareing off after a woman in distress, this time John Carter's Granddaughter.This one is billed as four short novels, but it's really just a single story with its parts disarticulated so as to create novelettes for serial publication in some magazine.
No less cohesive than any of the other novels.Other than the humor and almost ironically stereotypical behavior of old John Carter, this one doesn't offer a huge amount of new material.
Up through, say, the 8th or 9th books, I don't believe that there was so much as a mention of any alcohol abuse.Though I love them dearly, I can tell that, by this time, the Barsoom stories were running pretty short of steam.
These were considered "planetary romances" according to one source back when this series from the creator of Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs, was written.
It's a Virginian, John Carter, an immortal, who is able to pass back and forth between bodies: one on Earth, the other on Mars.I read these books because they were an inspiration to other authors, such as Conan creator, Robert E, Howard, who paid tribute to Burrough's in his novella,  Almuric.
At the heart of today's popular sci-fi there are traces of Burroughs and John Carter of Mars.I was most interested in finding traces of George Lucas's Star Wars in these books; and traces abound.
The real weak point in the 'Barsoom' books is always the quality of writing, and in this one it just becomes so bad that its flaws are glaring to anyone past junior high.
The book explores no themes not better covered in Burroughs earlier 'Barsoom' works.
Other familiar themes are resurrected as well, and all in less satisfying forms than the earlier usages.
There is pretty much nothing here that you can't get from his better 'Barsoom' works, and the only real reason to read it is if you are such a fan of his other works that you feel the need to read this one for completeness.
Tenth book in ERB's Martian Tales brings John Carter back into the forefront and again have him setting off to rescue a damsel, this time his granddaughter, the beautiful Llana of Gathol.
Carter's quest to rescue her and stop the mad Abtol takes him from a dead city that is not so dead to Abtol's frozen kingdom at the Martian polar cap to a bizarre invisible city in the middle of a desert oasis.
While being the tenth book, Burroughs keeps things as imaginative as always and that and the fast pace keep this basic damsel rescue tale fresh.
I should write a review of the plot in these reviews for my own memory.
I had to check out the Barsoom wiki when Tan Hadron of Hastor shows up.
There were a lot of other cameos from characters in past books and I had to look up every one of them but I was happy to see them sho up in this one.
The book was great moving fast-paced from one creative yet predictable adventure to another.
It ended really fast though and we never get to find out the fates of Tan Hadron, Gor-don and Fo-nar aboard the Dusar.
Some of the old John Carter magic reappears in this late installment – the last complete novel – of the Barsoom series.
Though it is more a quartet of related novelettes than a novel, perhaps.And that may be a good thing, as it speeds the action along.
It’s not unlike a modern television drama/adventure series in this respect, self-contained stories within a larger arc.‘Llana’ ends up being one of the more entertaining of Burroughs’s later Mars novels.
They are nicely done and do manage to evoke the wonder of Barsoom occasionally.I could almost bring myself to give “Llana of Gathol” four stars.
After a long long time finally had the opportunity to get back to Barsoom.
Llana of Gathol is a collection of four novellas with a bit parody.
Though there isn't any genuine John carter all out navy warfare but a brief glimse, there are great duels.
The four novellas are interconnected and the main theme is making impossible escapes with a intact ass.
;) It'll be a great short read for ERB fans but for others i'm not so sure.
Though it's named after the granddaughter of John carter, she has absolutely no part but being a chained dummy most of the time.
I have completely given up on reading Burrough's Mars books in order, and that really isn't much of a problem.
In this one, the heroic John Carter wanders the dying planet of Mars in search of his grandaughter, Llana of Gathol, fighting off a legion of the ancient dead, an army of frozen and then thawed warriors, a city of invisible people (who can only be seen under special lights), and a host of other challenges.
Like all the Barsoom books, this combines the best of classic science fiction with lots of sword-play, adventure, and space ships that are more like galleons.
Please note, this 5 star rating is based on my long ago memories of this book - I may have read it greater than 20 years ago. I recall reading and really liking it, and even kept the book to read again in the future (something I only do with good, or otherwise significant books). The memories of an old man are sometimes faulty so this could really only warrant 3.5 to 4.5 stars, instead of the 5 I gave it. Once I re-read the book I will update this rating/review to more accurately reflect my thoughts.
More classic swashbuckling science fiction as John Carter and the Martian maiden of the title are trapped in a lost city and must fight to get past the city's decadent rulers.While, I love Tarzan, John Carter and his adventures on Mars are my favorite Burroughs series. Manly men, buxom scantily clad women in need of rescuing , cool monsters, tons of action and wild, exotic settings.One of the great fictional places.
Another great book in Burroughs' "John Carter" series. One has the feeling of some repetition since this is the 10th in the series. Nevertheless, this like Burroughs' other stories is a captivating read, despite the way it spans cities, time and characters too numerous to remember. I was reminded once again how much of a visionary genius the author was. If you've seen it in a Star Wars or any other sci-fi movie, chances are it was pilferred from this or the companion books.
Lots of recycling in this one: four different cities no one has heard of, cut off from the rest of Mars; back to the north pole; another valley of the First Born; another scene where John Carter is man-handled by invisible people; etc. The coincidences are thick, as is the misogyny of the "I don't understand women" / "ah, women" variety. I'm not sure it's the worst of the Mars novels--it at least has some variety to it, where books 4-6 were more monotonous. But it's not in the top half.
A series of fast paced adventure tales set on Barsoom. Unlike some of the other later Barsoom books, in this one the focus us back on John Carter, as he confronts Hin Abtol, an villainous jeddak from the far northern reaches of Barsoom. All the usual components of the Barsoom stories are here: Weird Martian societies, a damsel in distress (Carter's granddaughter), airships, unlikely coincidences and numerous sword fights. A fluffy bit of good fun.
Four long short stories make up this 10th instalment in Burroughs Barsoom/ Mars series, they tell of four incidents along John Carters journey as he attempts to save Llana and return her to Gathol. The first "The Ancient Dead" aka "The city of mummies" is by far and away the best, the promise of which is never fulfilled in the other parts.To rate the four parts separately I would give: "The Ancient Dead" ****"The Black Pirates of Barsoom" **"Escape on Mars" ***"Invisible Men of Mars" ***
One adventure after another, and a lot of fun for all that. The first-person narrator of John Carter is the best in this book, conversational and wry. I'm a little sad that it's the last real book of the series - there is one more, but it's a collection of 2 short stories. I've really enjoyed the series!
