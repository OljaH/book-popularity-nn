The actual stories from the tablets are interesting, but this book spends a lot of time talking about how the tablets were found, by whom, and how they were stored, etc. I liked reading the tablet transcriptions and the abridged epic of Gilgamesh, but it took a really long time to get to the actual meat of this story.
This is the story of the Deluge, that one told in the bible, but written by different people.Actuall
So here's a couple of the Assyrian Lion Hunt images (now at the British Museum):[image error] Cool, right?How the book is divided.1) Introduction to how the clay tablets were discovered in Nineveh.2) The Babylonian story of the Deluge and Uta-pishtim (the hero of that story)3) Gilgamesh's quest for immortality What I liked about this book Although formatting at times could be better, and the book really could use a map and a few illustrations, overall it was a pleasant and informative read.
DecentI found it difficult to follow and understand a lot of what was written. It was interesting to read about the deluge from another perspective. It was worth reading.
What's there to say, it's the earliest known telling of the great flood and pre-dates any Christian reference to the flood (Noah) by thousands of years.
