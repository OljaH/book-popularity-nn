I loved these books as a child. Used to check them out from our city library. Great morals. Inspired me to be a better kid. :D Discovered a used copy of this one recently. Wish I owned them all.
I thought my kids would like the stories in this book. They enjoyed them but were never excited for them. They also had some Biblical "truths" that I think are pretty loose interpretations of scripture. Certainly not hanging on to this one.
My kids LOVE these books. After every single story they say, "Can you read ONE more?" They would sit and listen for hours, even the 2.5 year-old twins like them for some reason.
This series insured that I would grow up and be all Catholic-like.
