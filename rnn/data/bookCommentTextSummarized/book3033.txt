Lofting originally intended to end the series with Doctor Dolittle in the Moon, but for some reason changed his mind and the book was published.
اما آیا مرد ماه به وی اجازه ی بازگشت به زمین را می‌دهد؟ دوستان دکتر دولیتل روی زمین از دلتنگی او بی‌قرار شده‌ اند، و هر شب به امید دیدن علامت دکتر از ماه، همسایه کوچک زمین را مشاهده می‌کنند.
It should be noted that Lofting originally intended to end the series with that book, but for some reason changed his mind; five years after the publication of Doctor Dolittle in the Moon, Doctor Dolittle's Return was published.Almost all the old favorites are here: Polynesia, Dab-Dab, Jip, Gub-Gub, Chee-Chee, Too-Too, Cheapside the Cockney sparrow, Whitey the mouse, and the old lame horse.
The first half of the book covers the lives of Tommy Stubbins, the Doctor's assistant, and the Dolittle family of animals in England as they wait for his return; then the exciting moment when he does return; and the Doctor's convalescence, as well as the story of how he managed to escape from the Moon.
God, I love these books!Such a great blend of the fantastic and the real world, as the good Doctor, his helper Tom Stubbins and a boat load of animals deal with problems and adventures big and small.Can be a bit dry and politically incorrect, but keep in mind they were written 70 years ago and just enjoy the magic here.
Dr Dolittle returns from the moon in a book written long before the first lunar landings. A nice gentle (if mental) read.
Children's
Doctor Dolittle's return by Hugh Lofting (1933)
read as a child, don't remember it in particular, though I do remember the first one.
