Valjda sam zbog tog prvog lošeg iskustva kasnije "kopala oči" lošim lektorima koje je sudbina povezala sa mnom (kod raznih izdavača) i koji su bili skloni da prevodiocima prčakaju neovlašćeno i nepotrebno po tekstu a da im s druge strane slonovi promiču...
I šta god da svako od nas lično misli o kvalitetu i stilu njenih knjiga mora joj se skinuti kapa da već četrdeset i kusur godina uspeva da se održi u samom vrhu bestseler lista, da joj knjige imaju milionske tiraže (pre krize svaka njena knjiga imala je početni tiraž od ravno milion primeraka, sada je to spalo na 600-700 hiljada...
Very touching,beautifully written,with strong and lovable characters.....(paperback!)
I'd say that this book was mainly directed towards teens. I thought this book was very knowledgeable and interesting. I loved how Steele portrayed the idea that there is a reason for everyone who enters your life, and there is also a reason for their leaving. Also that not everyone is meant to be a part of your life forever, but some are only there to bring a "gift," not saying what that gift might be.
This is a heart warming, compassionate and yet inspirational book about two families that have suffered tragedies and are trying to get their lives back.
In the first part of the book you meet a perfect and happy family of Whittaker that loves each other very much.
Whittaker’s are a family of four: John, Liz, Tommy and Annie.
Annie and Tommy got along very well and always loved to be around each other (unlike most siblings).
Second part of the book switches settings featuring Maribeth, a young struggling teenager who got pregnant.
As I was perusing the Rockridge library in search of a romance novel for my month of trash, I felt unexpectedly out of place turning the revolving paperback romance shelves, like I had found one of the many hidden exits from well-adjusted, socially accepted sanity into the hazy fringe.
After Steel kills off one of the kids and the family implodes over the loss of that oh-so-precious "gift," we meet a completely different family who are so very bad, with a pig-headed lout of a father, an equally boorish brother, a mousy, submissive mother, and lo, a sparklingly brilliant young girl full of wit and intelligence and premature beauty who gets knocked up and cast out into the cruel world to birth her unwanted child alone.With a setup like that, a computer could write the rest.
أتحدث معهم وعنهم وإليهم في بساطة وتلقائية وهدوء ..تخيلت أنني أشاهد الرواية تحدث أمامي حقا ..وحتي حين اضطررت إلي التوقف عن القراءة ليومين ، عدت إليها وكأنها لم تفارق يدي لحظة !دانيال ستيل ...لقد جئت بما يجول في أذهاننا جميعاً حين نمتلك ما نريد ونخشي فقدانه يوماً ما ..حين ينتظرنا القدر في صبر وهدوء في نهاية شارع أحلامنا ...
مكتوب ولا سبيل للتراجع أو تغيير المنعطف الذي أصبحنا نحياه بالفعل !!صديقة لي قالت يوماً : الهدايا تأتي مُخبئة وهذا ما حدث مع القدر في هذه الرواية ، فلقد كانت الهدية مُخبأة بالفعل في قدر مُغلف بالأيام والانتظار والصبر ..يقول الشيخ الشعراوي رحمه الله :إذا أخذ الله منك ما لم تتوقع ضياعه، فسوف يعطيك ما لم تتوقع أن تملكه..دانيال ستيل ..
هنالك بعض الاشخاص يمرون سريعاً في حياتنا بعدما يكونوا قد منحونا هدية ما..تلك التي نُذكرنا بعد رحيلهم عنا إنه مازالت أرواحهم ترافقنا ولم تُغادرنا  وما يدريك لعلك عندما تهدي أحدهم الحياة مجدداً ...قد يمنحك هو مستقبلاً :)
Her family, especially her dad gets really mad at her, and tells her to leave the house at once and live in a convent until the baby is out, and she could come back, but without her child.
They both go meet Tommy's family and tell her about Maribeth, she feels like they are the people she should give the baby to.
She gives her baby to them, and promised them that she would come back after she has completed her studies.They found Annie back from Maribeth's child, which was the greatest GIFT ever!
The guy knew she was pregnant from a previous love and it was rather a romantic acceptance.The twist of giving up her Baby to a family who once lost a child was just soul crashing.
She was too young; she can absolutely give no care.Yeah.It might be so stupid for a Mother to give up her child but what good is to raising one if life would mean hunger and death.Her baby was given to the Guy's family (the guy from her renewed life),then a promise that if she will be all stitched up and well, she'll be back for him and her Baby.It was one dissatisfying ending but it filled me soooo much in my bucket!
Annie had give the family the meaning of love.
Until their son Tommy start a relationship with a girl which happened to be pregnant.
Maribeth had got pregnant in her first time and with no luck the father rejected her and the baby.
After running away, she met Tommy who become best friends.
But she was decided to give the baby away.
Tommy's family was alive again with the presence of Maribeth.
She decided to give away the baby to the family; she knew they would take care of the baby really well.
Annie, Tommy, John, Liz, Maribeth
I am on holidays from my studies and decided to read a DS novel.
It was a refreshing and endearing easy read.
A 1950's setting which could easily translate to current day, I flew through this without a moment's hesitation.
I found this hiding in a draw in the caravan after my summer holiday ~ I bit off more than I could chew with my reading list ~ it would have been perfect for that setting as well.
I tend to read DS on holidays, for that simple and comforting reason of light, easy and comfortable.
Guess you could say it's one of my reading quirks!
While waiting tables, she meets a regular who happens to be a sixteen year-old boy with a bad home life and the two begin to open up to one another and fall in love.I wasn't planning on reading another Danielle Steel book, but a friend of mine who also usually doesn't care for the author either recommended The Gift and lent me her copy.
I just wish we got to see this from Maribeth's own family.Overall, Danielle Steel's The Gift wasn't for me.
Ambos están en una situación que resulta difícil para ellos, Tommy tratando de superar la muerte de su hermana y luchando contra el derrumbe de su familia y Maribeth contra un embarazado indeseado.
Como bien dice Maribeth, hay personas que llegan a tu vida como un regalo, una bendición y eso es lo que ella fue para la familia Whittaker un regalo.
Si hay algo que odié de este libro fue al padre de Maribeth.
Aplaudo a Maribeth por mantenerse firme en todo momento, la decisión que tomó fue dura pero no dudo que fuera la correcta.
It was a great story in my opinion on how this family overcomes misfortune that seem impossible to overcome.
What i like most of all was the fact that the story took place in 1950s where what the brave young girl did and acted was seen as shameful and now most young girls have done what she has and worst and now the way girl acted in the book seem to be how girls now a days are.
As i was reading this book to me the girls family seem to be hispanic just by the way they acted the father and the mother and older brother especially.
Even thought it is about a middle class white family.
Wow! One of those books you read so long ago that you forgot about it! Discovered again/reminded about thanks to Goodreads. I marked it as read, however since it's been 'so' long, I'm not rating it. Just remember reading it and liking it back then......memory lane.
It was really sad in the beginning because Annie died, and I was literally crying. I loved Tommy and Meribeth's love story, I also liked that Tommy wanted to marry her even though she was having some else's baby. But I didn't liked the fact that she didn't wanted to keep her own baby, I was quite angry with her when I was reading the book. But other than that I LOVED IT!!!!!
Genul de carte foarte usor de citit..
Ma temeam ca finalul o sa fie "ieftin" si siropos (ca au trait fericiti pana la adanci batraneti), dar nu a fost, motiv pentru care i-am acordat o stea in plus.
Parca ar fi scrisa pentru adolescenti..
si n-ar fi deloc o idee rea daca ar citi-o mai multi tineri.
Sunt cateva "lectii" tratate foarte interesant si pentru cei care au minte sa priceapa, ar putea fi chiar educativa.
Daca esti genul care se transpune in pielea personajelor (cum sunt eu), ar fi indicat sa ai o cutie cu servetele la indemana.
:)Am citit-o intr-o zi mohorata de februarie.
This was an easy read.
The story was "cute" and heartwarming.
The writing was very story driven; and by that I mean there was a lot of "she did this and he said that and they went here" but not as much descriptive details about the surroundings as many other books I read have.
The story was enjoyable to read, and had some great lessons in it, but it wasn't one of those stories that I couldn't put down.
I do wish there was a sequel, because I'm wondering if the main characters kept their promise to each other or not.
OK, I will admit it. Danielle Steele is a bit predicatble. By the second chapter I had guessed at the ending; but reading the story and getting there was great. This is a total tear jerker. I would love a follow up story to see what happens with Tommy and Maribeth in the future.
2.5 starsa sweet and heart touching story about love and people in our lives.it was a nice read :)
My first book by this author and coincidentally it was a gift by a friend.
4,5🌟
Onze anos para quem tem 23...Enfim, é um livro passado nos anos 50, sobre uma jovem muito ingénua que se deixa enganar por um espertalhão e acaba grávida.É também a história duma família que perde uma criança.
Quando as duas histórias se entre-cruzam, uma rapariga desesperada ansiosa por "se livrar" de um bebé, e uma família a necessitar dum para se erguer da tristeza, a Danielle está no seu elemento: muitas lágrimas, muito choro, muito drama.
Volvidos mais uns quantos livros da Danielle Steel, percebi que a fórmula dela também é sempre a mesma.
Wow, I simple loved it.
A story of love, lost and hope.
A face pace novel, that touched my heart.
I am sure that this novel will stay with me.
On Christmas day Annie a little girl of five felt ill and died.
She was too precious for her parents and her brother, she brought them so much joy and love that when she left them, they were destroyed.
They stopped talking to each other and retreat in to a place full of guilt, hurt and anger.
One day when Tommy was in a dinner, he met Maribeth, he was immediately drawn too her.
J'ai lu ce livre avec une connaissance préalable de ce qui va se passer à la fin toutefois je n'ai guère pu le laisser à côté et lire un autre roman.
Il faut être bel et bien avec nous mène et d'autrui quelque soit la situation, c'est une morale à prendre et à appliquer pour sentir bien dans sa peau à fur et à mesure.
I wasn’t ready for the dramatic assault.
Those who still believe in unexpected gifts that give joy and agony to life should read this book.While reading this book, all I did is cry and cry and cry.
Though I haven’t experience the characters problems, I can feel their pain and agony.
Bu t I am kinda disappointed with the ending.
The little voice in my head was craving for MORE and when I turned the next page, I was disappointed that I just found an order slip of the author’s book.
The book "The Gift", tells a beautiful story of a tragic loss of a child.
The Whitaker family was truly blesses with another child Annie, but after she had died the family is in shreds and could never fully recover from what was taken from them.
It is truly heartwarming and really emphasizes the true gift of a child.
Thought the book is sad it shows great meaning and truth to the emotions and lives after a family loses a child.
The book turns around and shows a great and rejoice full ending full of peace and family.
This is a feel good romance novel starring 1950's teens as the main characters.
I struggled with whether the plot seemed realistic or not.
Things do seem to "iron out" just a little too well.
More importantly, it does repeatedly convey a strong message: there is a reason that people enter and leave your life.
Not everyone is meant to stay a part of your life forever.
It would be interesting to read a sequel to this book, set in the 1970's (20 years later) to see how the teens fared as adults.
I loved this book. Its like a romantic tale of two lovers that were brought together by chance. This book shows how one person can change your life. It shows how a family could be broken apart by the loss of one person and then repaired with the gift of another!! Great novel!!! One of my favorites by Danielle Steel. This book got me into her novels to begin with. If you have the chance read this book
I chose to read this book based off a quote I stumbled upon in my search for inspiration about losing love ones. Unbeknownst to me, I entered the rainbows and sunshine realm of Danielle Steel's romance fiction, suffered immensely, and waited longingly for the salvation of the last page. This book was repetitive, boring and downright cliché.
