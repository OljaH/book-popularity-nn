There are some like Wilde's that really stand out: The Mummy's Foot and The Rival Ghosts.
I can't abide the dialect written in "Dey Ain't No Ghosts" but the story is amusing.
Some were good; some were not. None were humorous
This was a fun collection from 1921.
So kudos to this collection!
I have recently read a good number of books from the early 1920s, and have frequently found myself zipping along, enjoying both the story and the world of the time, when suddenly these hideously racist beliefs -- beliefs which were soon to lead to eugenics and the Nazis -- pop up, grinning at me like a skull.
That is part of the value of reading old literature, though.
Good or bad, it helps us understand where we are now to remember where we were then.
i have a theory, racism is something hacks use instead of words.
if a pen for hire is incapable of the craft of developing characters or a theme one thing they pour liberally of some lazy caricatures.
this book is the most extraordinary example.
It is not a long book but it is a difficult read.
my favorite stories were Oscar Wilde's The Canterville Ghost, The Transferred Ghost by Frank R.
It gets really out there weird like all great compilations do with In the Barn, Ghost Extinguisher and The Lady and the Ghost.
Its an important book that shows racism as a contrived cliche only used by the easily forgotten.
A collection of funny novellas. Some hilarious, some not so hilarious.
Some of the stories were very interesting to read while most others were painful to go through. The main reason for this was my difficulty in understanding the writing style and accents used.
This is a collection of ghost stories from around the turn of the century. It is interesting to see which aspects of what frightens us when things go bump in the night have stayed the same, and which things have changed. Some of the stories are written in what was considered old Southern uneducated dialect, which is definitely not popular these days. Altogether, it was a pleasant read, but not spectacular.
This is a collection of older (mostly written around 1900) ghost stories. Imaginative and funny.
I didn't finish the book. I read the first story, tried with the second and the third and eventually gave up.
Over all a good book; but as it is a collection of short stories they vary in quality. I found "Dey ain't no Ghost" unreadable.
Only finished cause it bothers me not to. Not worth the time. Was not really funny just a story.
