For this modern reader, and, I suspect, many others, it makes it hard to take anything he says seriously.Furthermore, Phillips spends much of the book detailing the economy of plantation life, but never acknowledges that slavery itself was, at its heart, an economic institution.
Second, Phillips book was the first to explore the economics of North American plantation slavery.
It is fundamental to his benevolent patriarchy argument that slavery simply was not profitable but for the very largest plantations (i.e., so they must have been doing it for a reason other than profit).In the end, Phillips, like all historians, and his history was the product of his time.
Slavery has been practiced by many civilizations and cultures though out history. This works addresses the slavery of blacks in America. At the same time whites were being enslaved in other parts of the world. The author addresses the procurement and treatment of black slaves.
You have to read Phillips with an discerning mind. He is a paternalistic racist with a romanticized view of the Old South, and while that makes him unable to truly grasp the slaves' situation, it doesn't make him any less knowledgeable about plantations and how they functioned.
Warning: requires a strong stomach.The writer is an apologist, the subject is horrific, and the WRITING is what requires a strong stomach. The first part of the book is well researched. In the second part of the book the author 'cherry picked' his data. This book does contain useful information about the slave trade. Just remember the writing is not unbiased.
