Or maybe because Bastian does what I had always dreamed of as a child, since the day I started reading: to enter inside a book, to turn my imagination into reality.
And what is this book if not the most beautiful ode to imagination and story telling?The first time I read this I was probably about 11 or 12 and it was after seeing The Neverending Story II in the theater.
I read the book all in one day, from morning till night, with nothing but the same lunch Bastian packed for himself in the movie (I may have cheated later on at night.
Luckily for him, this proves unsuccessful, and faced with the loss of his memories, Bastian finally realises that his dearest wish is to love himself, to be able to love, that without love, there truly is absolutely nothing.Die unendliche Geschichte (The Neverending Story) therefore demonstrates (and demonstrates this clearly and shiningly) how the interaction and interplay of fantasy and reality, of Fantastica and humanity only succeeds if one strives to use fantasy and imagination to improve reality, and that because Bastian is unable to love either the world or himself, he uses fantasy not to improve reality, but to escape from it (to even destroy it perhaps).

I'm not one for dumbing down, but this goes the other way pointlessly.I saw the film around the time it came out years ago.
The book seems to reach the end of the film by about half way through.
That first half is cleverly done with a good idea about binding the reader and the adventure together in a 'meta' way that works out really well.
The pacing is ok, the imagination great - chaotic, but good.For me Ende should have stopped there and wrapped it up.The second half of the book feels...
(долу и на български, но по-прибрано ;)The first--and still most luminous--story that urged me to stop running away from my life into books and start weaving books back into my life.
If this sounds too abstract, consider the Human Library: a child of The Neverending Story, a sister of Moonchild.This book made me polish my German enough to read it in the original.
But I have a theory.Having loved the movie version of this in my youth, the whole story is etched into the part of my psyche that deals with childhood; that time when so much is new; where much in the world is observed through an inner-wonder of the mind and a stirring of the soul: a magical state, by adult standards.
And “self” is everything.Much of what I read captured me, putting me in a state in which I was accessing stirred-up feelings through a strange inner memory that I’m incapable of generating even partly on my own, without help, as an adult.
Like many people of my generation, I loved the film adaptation (the first, not the second, thank you) and never realized that it had come from a book until a number of years later.
I keep picking up the book and going, "Is she old enough, yet?
Is she?" Then I set down the book and tear out my metaphorical hair and let out a forlorn cry.
This is easily one of my favorite tales, ever.An extra goodie: April had a great review that forced me to think and respond in (I hope) a comprehensible way.
April's Review
Meanwhile, holed up in his school's attic, Bastian Balthazar Bux reads a purlorned book and soon finds himself pulled into...
What the hell is going to be in the second half?"Well, the ending of the movie provides the hint.
Bastian Balthazar Bux at the end of the book is almost totally different from the one at the beginning.I wound up enjoying the book quite a bit but, like Falkor's depiction, the movie and the book are totally different animals.
The movie captured the adventurous bits without all the morals in the second half.
And I still hear him yell the name of the Empress: "Mondenkind", in German, probably Moonchild in English, in order to save that beautiful fantasy world from the big, dark nothing that is eating it as a result of children losing interest in storytelling.I read the book in German as a child and saw the movie later - and I was always annoyed by the fact that it ends halfway through!
Beskrajno uzivanje!!!! Milion zvezdica!
Think on that for a minute and tell me your childhood isn't curled up in a little ball in the closet crying.The book was originally written in German, brought to you on the screen by a German director and crew, and only after the movie was so popular did the book get translated into a few more languages.The plot of The Neverending Story needs no summarizing for most people.
The second half of the book focuses on the child Bastion, who is pulled into the book after giving the Childlike Empress her new name, which, by the way, people have been asking for years, because that kid is completely unintelligible in the movie.
I have really great memories of reading this book.
Looking back, this book might have been the culprit of me falling in love with books, up until that time I had always liked and enjoyed reading, but I believe it was that summer, with The Neverending Story that I truly fell in love with reading.
In my opinion The Neverending Story is meant to be read at a specific moment of time, it should be read at a young age so you can still get into the daydreaming and enchanting spirit the whole book is surrounded by.
I have read it multiple times and I was extremely disappointed with the movie adaptation.I truly believe that this story has inspired me and made me love Fantacy books so much later on as an adult.(If my remember correctly my godfather gave it to me as a Christmas present together with "Comet in Moominland" by Tove Jansson.
She has a vivid imagination this kid :)So it is Christmas holidays, school holidays and this is the perfect opportunity to start a neverending story with her(in english this time).
English/ItalianoFirst of all, I have to say I am not a native english speaker so, please, I prefer to not be attacked, if I made any mistakes. Instead of do that, it would be nice if you corrected me, thank you :)  “If you have never wept bitter tears because a wonderful story has come to an end and you must take your leave of the characters with whom you have shared so many adventures, whom you have loved and admired, for whom you have hoped and feared, and without whose company life seems empt
Now let’s begin with the actually review of the book.The plot: Bastian Balthazar Bux, a eleven-year-old boy who loves reading, one day, while he was running from bullies, entered in a bookstore.
Se stai leggendo la mia recensione, non hai ancora letto questo libro e ami i libri fantasy, allora devi leggere La Storia Infinita di Michael Ende adesso.
(view spoiler)[Nella seconda parte del libro, proprio dopo che ha salvato Fantasia, lui, a causa dei desideri, diventa un’altra persona: forte, coraggiosa, non ha più paura di niente.
E’ come se ci sono storie all’interno di una storia all’interno del libro che ho letto.
Un libro excelente. Fantasía al 100 %. La historia interminable, a través de su película, me acompañó por muchos años de mi infancia. Su lectura actual es una especie de reencuentro con ese mundo.

I am convinced my neighbour came from there!!!🐯👍The Eternal Stench, a smelly, dank, dark, mysterious locationA swamp full of creatures, monsters, twisted vegetationBoiling and bubbling fetid and stinky, a bog, a quagmireA slimy, slippery, unkempt, unclean and direI swear I saw a face familiar to meIn the film, many years ago, a grotesque entityI read about him in the book tooA deviant, a goblin, stinking of puss and pooThe face I know, that was on showI see him every day, such a nasty little fellowNever washes, films the children, and does his thingProtected by a system, a vulnerable man, am I joking?Not at all, this demon, this thing, that the council moved in next doorMy goodness, did he come riding alongside the Babylon Whore?Maybe, who knows?
My mind is all at seaFighting against a Beast System, an Eternal Stench, protecting He🐯👍
I feel like I'm very torn on this book because while I did enjoy it and did enjoy listening to it, it was so rough to get through. I liked the story, but it didn't hook me and capture me and make me want to keep reading, so it took me over a month to listen to it (SO LONG).Overall a really interesting story with a lot of unique circumstances and characters! I've also never seen the movie (I KNOW) and I know it's super different so now I want to watch it even more!
Το βιβλίο Ιστορία χωρίς τέλος το διάβασα για πρώτη φορά πριν εννιά χρόνια.
Σε αυτή την ανάγνωση ήρθα αντιμέτωπη με νέα δεδομένα και η ιστορία που διάβασα δεν μου φάνηκε καθόλου ίδια με εκείνη εννιά χρόνια πριν.
Η πρώτη μου παρατήρηση, αυτό που θαύμασα, είναι το εύρος των εικόνων, των πλασμάτων και των σκηνικών που έχει δημιουργήσει ο Έντε και το εύρος των δυνατοτήτων που δίνει στον ήρωα του όταν αυτός είναι στην φανταστική χώρα.
Τι άλλαξε; Πιθανότατα να είναι θέμα διάθεσης, ίσως.Διστάζω να αλλάξω βαθμολογία και δεν θα το κάνω διότι πέρασα δέκα χρόνια να αγαπώ αυτό το βιβλίο και τώρα απλά λυπάμαι που χάλασα την σχέση μου μαζί του.

Like I always say, a picture is worth 1000 words, but a mental picture is worth 1000 times more.
So often, we just read words and don't transform them into pictures.
And Ende doesn't disappoint: If we do the work, he gives us a very rich world to run around in (And, masterfully, this is actually the plot of the book.)This book is at the top of my list because I now consider it a fundamental book on how to read books: it schools the imagination.
Afterwards, you'll never read another book in the same way again.
One blustery stormy day Bastien goes inside of an antique bookstore and discovered a mysterious book called the Neverending Story.
When the bookshop owner Mr. Coreander is not looking, Bastien steals the book and hides in the attic of his school to read it.
It is only when he begins to read the Neverending Story that his adventure truly begins.
Read the book for yourself and find out.I have seen this film when I was younger, but this was my first time reading the actual book.
I actually enjoyed reading this book.
This is one of my favorite books I have read for 2016 and it was a magical adventure!
Il nulla di fronte a voi, la fantasia in voi L'affabulazione fantastica diventa cartina tornasole di
I just read it with my daughters and we absolutely loved it.
How fantasy can be turned into lies by those that would deny the importance of an even balance between imagination and reality, how those lies are easily manipulated....yeah, this book has much to ponder, in fact, I think I need to read it again.The girls and I had many conversations about symbolism and it's use in literature.
This author does much with the use of cycles and their natural progression in all life.
Terminar el libro es como salir de Fantasía, uno quiere volver a vivir aventuras de las que siempre se sale victorioso. Pero las historias de aquí tienen ese aire trágico, en el que se sale perdiendo, abandonado y dolorido. Dejemos elegir al amor.
I love the idea of a reader being taken to the land of the book he's reading.
The movie makes a bit more sense having read the book.
However, I couldn't believe when I got to the end of what I knew of the story that I still had about 200 pages left in the book.
That familiar bit of story is just as good now as it was then - and the end, when Bastian finds that happiness lies in loving others, is a great point, after all.
Un libro genial. Quizá flojea un poco al final, pero es que la primera parte es muy buena. Atreyu y Fújur entran en mi lista de personajes literarios favoritos.Le doy un 9.
It is meta fictional in a way which, for me, no other book has ever approached - I will never forget being 10 years old and reading as Bastian and the Princess turn and look at me reading them...I felt my stomach drop with such power I can still remember where I was, I can still see the room I lay in Wales on a winter holiday as it rained and sleeted outside.
I think the mediocre film has done great harm to the way this book is perceived.
I can't wait for when my son is old enough to read it, and I get to share it with him.
Knjiga citana kada sam bio daleko mladji, odgledani svi filmovi, i sada ponovo procitana knjiga i jos uvek podjednako magicno i zabavno kao i ranije.Nema sta puno da se kaze, odlicna knjiga za ljubitelje citanja sa puno maste i fantazije. Mirna preporuka za sve od 7 do 107 godina :)
Final rating: 5/5 stars   “Every real story is a never ending story.”   This review will be hard to write because I read the translation of this on my language, and my language tends to write names as how they would have sounded as spoken. So I have no idea how to write the names but I think i'll stuck with original names (on German).This book is a classic of literature - and Michael Ende, German author, did fantastic job with it. It became popular when it came out, and became even more popular
Bastian needs to learn that looks aren't important and that confidence comes as long as you believe in yourself.
This is a story about a fantasy world, a world filled with wonders, wishes, imagination and...
And the hero chosen is no older than Bastian himself - Atreju, an orphan boy who is adopted by his whole tribe, called son of everyone, is sent to find the mysterious savior and the way to cure the Empress who is slowly dying because of the NOTHING.
Like I have never forgotten the movie, the book will stay in my memories forever (But i'll regularly repeat reading because Atreju is so damn worth it.
Questo è il mio libro preferito.
Lo ritengo il manifesto in sé della fantasia, della parola fantasy e del suo genere.
La maggior parte dei lettori di questo genere considera J.
Tolkien il Re del fantasy, il maestro, il sommo, l'impareggiabile e bla bla bla.
In questo romanzo, uno dei pochissimi di Michael Ende, troviamo la ricerca di un bambino; una ricerca particolare ma anche la più ardua di tutte: la ricerca di se stessi, del proprio cuore, del proprio volere.
È il libro che mi ha insegnato più di tutti gli altri messi insieme.
Contrariamente a ciò che mi capita quando leggo un libro dopo averne visto la trasposizione cinematografica, sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa: la storia di Atreiu è solo una piccola parte di una narrazione ben più ampia, che passa anche attraverso e soprattutto i mutamenti del sentire di Bastiano, impreparato esploratore/demiurgo di un mondo suggestivo e coinvolgente, che, seppur si fa plasmare da lui, esiste al di fuori di lui e gli restituisce a modo proprio ciò che lui crea.
Bastiano è un bambino: se metti un bambino davanti una tavola piena di dolci, ne mangia fino a non poterne più.
Bastiano si mangia Fantàsia, senza rendersi conto che Fantàsia fa altrettanto con lui.
Varias re lecturas!Como decía con Momo, Ende siempre fue grande!Tenía la gran cualidad de hacer que sus libros tomaran significados completamente diferentes según la edad de lectura, pero sin dejar de ser entretenidos y una buena historia.Para mi, lleno de metáforas y de enseñanzas. Sin duda, libro de cabecera y recomendado para cualquier edad.
There are a lot of good bits that didn't make it to the screen (at least in the first movie -- my vague memories of the sequel include some of the second-half stuff, but I was disgusted by that one in the theater in 199X and I'm not about to watch it again (though my wife might want to, since she had a huge crush on Jonathan Brandis (RIP))).
Like Bastian isn't quite such a fat little turd.Oh right: because the book is kind of dated too.
I wish there had been a bit more about the main character in the real world because there I also found him fascinating, and I did like the much shorter reality part of the book as much as the long fantasy portion.I probably wouldn’t have felt this way earlier in my life, but as of my reading this week, the book seemed to go on a tad too long for me.
Bilo je neizmjerno zadovoljstvo pročitati Beskrajnu priču. Gradacija svijeta Fantazije i likova je tako osjećajno i maštovito pretočena na papir da je nemoguće ostati ravnodušan. Beskrajna priča je vanvremenska, eskapistička, poetizovana uzbudljivim avanturama neobičnih ljudi iz sasvim neobičnih života. Endeova Fantazija je oslikana umjetnošću bez ikakvog lamenta, stvarajući razboritost. Na početku svakog poglavlja knjigu krase ilustracije koje na jednostavan i lijep način prikazuju bića Fantazije. U par navrata se ovdje iskazuju i određene filozofske ideje, poput vječnog vraćanja istog. Bastijan i Atrej se ne zaboravljaju!
Senza amore cosa saremmo?Ho visto il film centinaia di volte, è stato tra i miei film preferiti da bambino/ragazzino, ancora oggi (non più giovanissimo :-P) me lo riguardo con molto piacere, ma il film non è che una piccola parte del libro.
Graogramàn: "la Morte Multicolore", forse è il mio "personaggio" preferito, ma sono tutti degni di nota e soprattutto originali, particolari!"Tutto quello che si vuole.
Forse servirà il tuo aiuto per indurre gli uomini a comperare cose di cui non hanno bisogno, o a odiare cose che non conoscono, o a credere cose che li rendono ubbidienti, o a dubitare di cose che li potrebbero salvare.
Sono davvero contenta di averlo letto finalmente.
Ho sempre visto solo il film, ma i libro è molto meglio.
Anche perchè il film è solo la prima metà del libro e non è neanche fedele.
Non dimenticherò mai l'incontro di Bastiano (Sebastian) con l'Infante Imperatrice (l'imperatice bambina), come non scorderò mai il primo volo su Fùkur (Falcor) e Atreiu.
E ovviamente non dimenticherò il momento in cui Bastiano incontra Mordok.
:P)Ma quello che non scorderò mai è tutta la seconda parte.
Pieno di messaggi che nel film sono solo abbozzati.
Micheal Ende has a really powerful writing style: it is really impressive how he is manipulating the reader, always surprising him with unpredictable tricks.
It's the true balance between reality and the book world: to plunge deeper in the imaginary world to come back braver, wiser and a grown-up while never forgetting the child inside.
Michael Ende is also delivering an important message to children and adults as well: imagination has no limit, and it must be encouraged and highly praised.
I highly recommend this book to both every child and every adult.
Die unendliche Geschichte ist wohl ein echter Klassiker der Kinder- und Jugendbücher.
Ich kannte bislang nur den ersten Film und habe das Buch nun zum ersten Mal gelesen.
Als ein Junge namens Bastian Probleme mit seinen Mitschülern und Eltern hat, gerät er an ein Buch, das ihn komplett verzaubern wird.
Er selbst wird zum Teil der Geschichte Phantasiens und muss sich einigen Aufgaben stellen.
Hier wusste ich nicht wo soll die Reise hingehen, was passiert hier eigentlich und da hat sich das Ganze für mich sehr gezogen.
Gegen Ende, als es wieder ein Ziel gab, fand ich die Geschichte wieder toll und konnte mit Bastian mitfiebern.
-RTC-
I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this book, it really is lovely for the most part, I just think that there is a little less magic in it for those adult readers.Okay, I recognize that my nonsensical ranting is starting to feel like a nevereding story of its own, and reader that is a story for another time...
So, let's wrap this thing up by saying - fun, imaginative book -- parents should go out right now and buy it for your kids (seriously don't screw 'em up, it's too late for me, but there may still be some hope for a few of those knuckle-headed mini bipeds).
🌟 3,2 estrellas:Es un libro precioso, con toda la creación de mundo y todos los personajes que contiene. Además de la parte interesante es el desarrollo del héroe y la reflexión final sobre ese camino que emprende. Mi único problema personal es que hay una parte del medio en que se me hizo muy pesada y cuando él comienza a ser un adonis andante lo odié bastante. Siento que si este libro lo hubiera leído en mi infancia, lo hubiera disfrutado más.
Lettura con il GDL Edicola & Libreria: le nostre passioni...Ero curiosissima di leggere questo libro perchè ovviamente, nel corso degli anni ho visto e rivisto il film (non me lo ricordo benissimo; sono anche passati tantissimi anni da l’ultima volta) e non sono rimasta delusa.La prima cosa che devo dire è che mi è piaciuto lo stile, per forza di cose, un po’ retrò.
Mi ha riportato ai libri della mia giovinezza; è indubbio che lo stile dei libri per ragazzi negli anni è fortemente cambiato (penso, per esempio, ad Harry Potter) e, anche se l’italianizzazione forzata di nomi e terminologia mi ha dato un po’ fastidio, dall’altra parte mi ha fatto rivivere quella splendida ingenuità, quella sensazione d’incanto, quello stupore che si prova solo da bambini.
