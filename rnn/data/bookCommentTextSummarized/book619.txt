[Seats himself as before.] [To himself.] I think I never knew a sillier game.CORYDON: [Coming to wall.] Oh, Thyrsis, just a minute!—all the water Is on your side the wall, and the sheep are thirsty.
. I'll say you had an eye out For lots of little things, my innocent friend, When I said, "Let us make a song," and you said, "I know a game worth two of that!"COLUMBINE: [Off stage.] Pierrot, D'you know, I think you must be getting old, Or fat, or something,—stupid, anyway!— Can't you put on some other kind of collar?THYRSIS: You know as well as I do, Corydon, I never thought anything of the kind.
we were going to do this play one day. in the woods maybe. the two of us. and it would have been splendid. "my only love, you are so intense!... it is tuedsay, Columbine?- I'll kiss you if it's tuesday."
The first scene begins and all of a sudden the actors from scene two come on stage and demand to do scene two.
After scene two is done, scene one begins again.
This play is about scene two.
You must suffer through scene one to get to the story.Scene two is about best friends who when put into a "made up situation" can actually become different people with deadly consequences.
It is such a short play that if I write more about it my comments would be longer than the play itself.I read this play twice and am glad I did.
Very historically aware and subtly so, Aria Da Capo draws on everything from Sidney to Shakespeare, from early 19th century Harlequinades to an anticipation of the Godotesque couple that hangs around doing nothing - and all this in one act. The wall in particular made me think of the wall in A Midsummer Night's Dream, which also appears in a play within a play where the actors have a tendency to forget their lines. Millay turns the story on its head, though, and I believe that's entirely why this play works so well.
Read this in high school and found it insufferable, as I find all Harlequinades.
