not gonna lie, it took me a little bit of time to fully get into this one, but the pay off was worth it. so many crazy things happened in this book & i'm still sitting here in a bit of shock! full video review to come.
(A-) 84% | Very GoodNotes: It deals in decision and destiny, drawing by doubt, defeat, and demure desire the draining disquiet of deep devotion.
So 5* it is.I picked this book up from Celyn's pile when we went off on her school trip (a week in the wilds) and being in a hurry I managed to get book 3 of the series rather than book 2 (we read book 1 last year).
The book is written in the same vein as the first, mining the Greek myths for monsters and plot, and mixing in an American road trip along with Percy's irreverent observations.We don't get much of Annabeth in the book as she's a prisoner for a lot if it.
A real rarity in a fantasy series in general.The story starts out with Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia trying to help Grover to sneak out two half-bloods from a private military style school.
Bianca and Nico are the new half-bloods and will prove to play important roles in how the plot moves along.It never fails to impress me how the author can intricately put everything into these books.
I never feel bored and I love the view he takes on different mythology stories.
You can tell the books are going to take a bit of a darker turn.
THE REVIEW IS POSTED3.8 Stars THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER  "There is always a way out for those clever enough to find it."  I should've written this review a few days ago but I didn't because I was pretty busy and well, lazy as well hahaha. My first year in university has started since Monday and I have been pretty busy with tasks lately but I'm enjoying my college life! ( so far ) it's so much fun! I'm writing this review on my phone so I will add gifs and the quotes from the book later becaus
It's really funny and the writing style is the first reason I enjoy reading this book.
at first I couldn't even guessing who his godly parent was but then when I was half way through the book or nearing the ending, I just had this thought that he might be the son of Hades and I WAS RIGHT and my heart was breaking for him.
Thankfully, I didn't read that scene in public otherwise I might got funny looks from my friends or anyone but I kind of thought that Grover was kind of strange, you know.
HADES!!!!!!! Gahhhh this book series is amazing!!!! Nico!!!!!
This offering in the series raises the stakes in small ways, but in others I felt like it was sort of...
One of which get unceremoniously dumped from the plot fairly quickly in terms of the entire series - unless they make a surprise return in later books that is -  and the other I'm sure will be expanded on in books 4 and 5, but here these characters felt almost totally useless.
I think a lot of things from this book will likely come up again and become important, so I'm happy to give this 4 out of 5 stars.
you know I would be proud of myself for finally reading something unrelated to the All For the Game series but now I’m going to binge reread the rest of this series and get obsessed all over again
Are you really surprised!?There seems to be a recurring theme with me and my favorite series.
Not one of my favorites was read ‘on time’.And Percy Jackson shares a lot of similarities with those books, especially Harry Potter.
Seriously now, Luke is so damn great!The one thing that made me shake my fist like an old man was Annabeth missing for a large chunk of the book.
And even though I think it might be my least favorite of the first series, it is still part of one of the best fantasy arcs I’ve ever read about.
So, my reviews for the PJO series are basically just going to be vague screaming (bc I can’t recall what scenes belong to which books but like BEAR WITH ME)So, my sweet precious Half-Blood children are sent on another mission where they’re sent to track down some monsters.
Annabeth my #Queen is captured, Percy and the group meet more half-bloods, and skeleton-zombie-creatures are born.
“Tyson thought Annabeth was just about the coolest thing since peanut butter, and he SERIOUSLY loved peanut butter.”  *Percy’s acting like he doesn’t think so too, plz son, you aren’t fooling anyone*4.5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~continuation of my PJO binge for Pragya's sake
I don't know if I'm going to finish the series. It was good but I think I'm just over it. I might read some of the other books though :-/
I'm an unpublished writer and I know the best I can hope for is that at some point some will like what I write, and some will well, rip it.I've not been "real complimentary' of these books up to this point, I gave each 3 stars...said they were what I'd call, "not bad".
Aside from the usual problem of Percy being so frustratingly (your going to see that word or it's root "frustrate" a few times in this review) thick this book manages to go to new heights in it's efforts to drive readers into banging their heads into walls.
I love you Percy
I Loved this book as expected.
I Loved his narration (don't know how many times I will say this :p).
I felt his narration little more humorous this time.Annabeth and Artemis, goddess of hunt, have been kidnapped by Titans' General.
Nico didn't appear much but I liked him except in the ending.
I am more interested in Nico after this ending.=> Zoë was a pretty good character.
I must admit that I didn't like her joining the Hunt even though I understood her reason.
Eagerly looking forward to his character!Overall, this book is, sort of, the turning point of the series.
I can't BELIEVE I was gonna skip this series 😮Amazing Pace that kept me breathless...checkLovable fun characters...checkMind-blowing world setting.. checkHot thrilling climax... checkSad sacrifice...checkProphecy fulfilled completely..checkEPIC GODS council...checkHuge other twist...check(More to come on all that !)And then..WHY INCLUDING A PREVIEW OF THE UPCOMING BOOK..Now I must read the next one.. right away.I'm justin love this series now...Mohammed Arabey27 July 2017(Real Review on this and Book 2, hopefully book 4 as well ASAP)
Its official, this is my favourite in the series. I so do not want to be Percy, the titans are so not slacking and he is in the middle of everything. Another thing that I love about this series is its originality, its cliche free, no YA cheesiness.The world building and writing style is as good as ever, there is a major improvement between the previous books in the series. The book is so humourous, the way Percy's mind work is so crazy.  I looked. And I couldn’t believe it. It was my car. Well,
The character development is astounding, Percy was 12 in the first book and now is 14, you can tell the difference in the ages, he is more mature now and is making decisions 12 yrs old him won't.
Grover was present and we have the rest of the old characters and some new badass ones, which are girls.I love Blackjack the Pegasus, his conversation with Percy is just so cool!
Listen, we got another little sea friend needs your help.Hey, if ya don’t come back, can I have your cabin for my stable?I looked at the pegasus.Just a thought, he said.
“Do you always try to kill people when they blow their nose?”  Well ... this actually gets better from the last book. The story without Annabeth is a good thing after I was tired by her. Rick Riordan managed to put the riddles and adventures together in this book, he even added the new characters, both gods and villains, in order to make the story more interesting. We have a chance to see Nico for the first time ! And for reading HoO before, I couldn't stop myself from grinning because I knew t
Rick Riordan managed to put the riddles and adventures together in this book, he even added the new characters, both gods and villains, in order to make the story more interesting.
And for reading HoO before, I couldn't stop myself from grinning because I knew this character would be one of my favorites after the end of the series.
I even saw the character development in this book, especially Percy being such a grown-up man, and I admired him for this cause alone.
Thalia is a badass character, and I loved her a lot.
at this point, percy does not give a fuck. he would fistfight any greek god, at any point, for no reason, just because he can. and im hugely here for it(review to come)
My favourite book of the series so far!
I wanted to write a haiku about my feelings but it turned out I'm worse at poetry than Apollo \_(ツ)_/

LET'S MAKE IT COMPULSORY FOR EVERYONE TO READ THESE BOOKS
4.5/5SO glad that I'm continuing on with this series! This book was fast paced and (in my opinion) way better than Sea of Monsters. I can't wait to read the next book soon!
Das war mal ein schneller und spaßiger Ritt durch die Seiten! Wieder ein tolles Abenteuer mit Percy, Annabeth und Grover. Der Schreibstil war auch wieder sehr angenehm, man fliegt nur so durch die Seiten. Rick Riordans Humor setzt dem ganzen dann noch die Krone auf 👌🏻👑
RATING:   Rick Riordan is a genius.I finished this book with a smile on my face, just like with the other two books. Friendship and family are two of the most prominent themes in this series and I think lessons like those are important for books that cater to younger readers. I find that these books are not only fun, but also teaches the readers something valuable. I'd most definitely recommend this series to my daugher when she's older. :)But really, this series is only getting better. I did lo
Friendship and family are two of the most prominent themes in this series and I think lessons like those are important for books that cater to younger readers.
Percy and the others need to get back to Camp Half Blood to get the Di Angelo kids to safety and find a way to get Annabeth back.
I hope I get to see his character change in the last two books.Percy was still good.
Annabeth is like my soul sister, I did not appreciate not reading about her.- I had a bit of a hard time connecting with Thalia at first.
#1 The Lightning Thief ★★★★☆#2 The Sea of Monsters ★★★★☆#3 The Titan’s Curse ★★★★☆#4 The Battle of the Labyrinth ???#5 The Last Olympian ???While I’ve given every book in the series 4 stars each so far, those have been very different 4-star ratings.
For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some divine force is really trying to mess up your day.Of course, as always, we get to spend time with Percy and Grover, but the opening of the book enters into Annabeth being whisked away, and that set a bit of a bad precedent for the entire installment for me, as I genuinely enjoy Annabeth’s character, as well as the banter she offers.
I actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the dad jokes in this one. A+ Rick riordan
I've been sneakily rereading the Percy Jackson series backwards the past month. I don't add them to my currently-reading shelf because I have ARCs and other stuff I should be reading instead and if I don't put them there, it doesn't feel like I'm procrastinating.It's during rereads that I discover the sheer genius Riordan weaves in his work. He introduces important characters in unimportant ways, and it's beautiful. The foreshadowing is unreal.Percy-fection.
Complete 5 Golden starsHow could I forget how much fun Apollo can bring at the moment he come?!(Ofc I did not forget the fun I just forgot how much, like I laughed at every sentence of that chapter, before even he starts talking.
XD)this one is definitely of my favs in the series!many funny moments, stealth, thrillers, that Dam joke, typical & atypical way of traveling &prepare for the feelz!BlackJack!
Nico!
Professor Chase!Zoe was annoying at first but through the end, She was awesome.Thalia was awesome.One of my favourites in the series <3-World building: ★★★★★/5-Characters: ★★★★★/5-Written style: ★★★★★/5HUMOR!: ★★★★★/5Feelz: ★★★★★/5-plot & events: ★★★★★/5-General idea: ★★★★★/5
And while I'm still waiting for crushing feels (I think that'll coming in the next Heroes of Olympus series more so than this one?) I'm starting to LOVE AND ADORE THESE BOOKS.
(hide spoiler)]Also...why the heck does someone ALWAYS interrupt when Percy and Annabeth are talking??
I seriously want to know what Annabeth keeps trying to tell Percy.
I see it.I also giggled at the scene where Aphrodite totally ships Percy and Annabeth.
And I like funny books.
