i learned to be eviiiilll with this book....haha actually this book made me realize how shady people can be.
Plus how smart you and ambitious you should be about succeeding in life.
You got to stand out in this world.
If you roll with the bunches you'll become lost.
You always have to have a good reputation or if you have a certain reputation you better use it to your advantage (damn im evil hahaha).
This book will expose and teach you alot about the real world.
One of my first books i really read and enjoyed.
it motivated me to keeping learning about myself and people.
When it comes to morality and ethics, people are used to thinking in terms of black and white.
There is really nothing wrong with most of the Laws.Each Law comes with true stories from history about those who successfully observed it and those who foolishly or naively transgressed it.
Robert Greene has an interpretation for each story.
Though each Law is self-explanatory, Greene's explanations are not padding, fluff or stuffing to make the book longer.
Greene's insight even extends to crucial warnings about how the Laws could backfire.There are two reasons to read this book:1.
For attack: To gain power, as have others who have carefully observed the Laws;2.
As I read it I couldn't help wondering how many politicians actually think this way.If I ever met someone who actually liked this book and wanted to live their life according to it, I would never hire that person, never work for that person, never do business with that person, and would try to avoid any and all relationships with that person.
أكتشفت للاسف انك مش لازم تكون شخص سيء ، بس لازم تعرف الناس دى بتفكر أزاى و ازاى تتعامل معاهم...و متنساش انك و انت بتحارب الوحش أنك تتحول لوحش ...من القواعد الجميلة هناك و اللى كتبها روبرت جرين بحرفية و واقعية بالغة ..1- لا تشرق أكثر من الرئيس .2- قل دائما أقل مما هو ضرورى3- مش لازم تقول للناس على نواياك4- العزلة تضيف الى المخاطر اكتر مما تحميك5- أتقن فن الظهور ( البرادعى أستاذ فى كده )6- اعرف كويس انت بتتعامل مع مين حتى لا تصيب أحد بجهالة7- أعمل من بنها ( لان مافيش حد يحب يحس انك اكتر منه ذكاء )8- ركز مجهودك فى مكان واحد..و غيرها و غيرها .....الكلام ده يا جماعة فية ناس بتعرفة بعد لما تعيش على سطح الكوكب اربعين و خمسين سنة ..و نص الناس دى مش هتعرف تطلع منه بجملة مفيدة عن ازاى هو نجح ؟ او يديك نصيحة فى حياتك ؟أحب اقول للناس بعد قرائة الكتاب ده ..أهلا بيكم على كوكب الارضعلى الرغم انه ماينفعش تكون مثالى فى عالم غير مثالى..
If the author is evil for writing this...am I evil for enjoying it?
يُعتبر الكتاب نسخة محدّثة وأكثر عمومية لكتاب الأمير لمؤلفه ميكافيللي؛ فبينما ركّز الأخير على القواعد الواجب اتّباعها لتحقيق الانتصارات السياسية وفرض السطوة، اتكأ روبرت جرين على حوادث تاريخية، سياسية وغير سياسية، لاستنباط قواعد تساعد في فهم طبيعة النفس البشرية بشكل عام، وكيفية تسخيرها للحصول على السطوة بالأخص في العمل.وجدتُ الكتاب مفيدًا وواقعيًا لأقصى درجة، لكنه ليس لذوي النظرة الوردية للحياة، فغالبًا لن يصدقوا حرفًا مما جاء فيه، وسيتّهمون كاتبه باللئم والخبث.
For those who have a moral objection to the amoral approach of the authors presentation, I understand your feelings, but I think you miss the point.
No matter how we feel about the dubious power plays that have occurred throughout history and that occur in our contemporary private and public lives, the fact is that they exist.
Here are 48 approaches to power that you will either attempt to use or you will experience them being used against you at some point in your life, whether you agree with it ethically or not.
“Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure.”— Tacitus, C. (A.D. 55-120)"...a woman who is interested in a man wants to see that other women are interested in him, too. Not only does that give him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from their clutches." -Robert Greene"Everything in seduction however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in words.""By saying
If people inadvertently learn the truth - that you are actually much smarter than you look - they will admire you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show." - Robert Greene (Law 21)"...the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept." - Athenian Delegation"...it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can." - Athenian Delegation"When the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and silently farts." - Ethiopian Proverb"In any organization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings.
I hated every word of this manual for the soulless.
It's a perfect example of exactly what's wrong with Big Pharma, big business, Wall Street, and in short capitalism as it's currently practiced.
This book, which is kinda-sorta a synthesis of many previous Me First directives (Machiavelli leaps to mind), is a handbook on how to fuck over everyone you come in contact with, in order for you to get "ahead" and "succeed".
It'd be awesome for sociopaths and wanna-be-CEOs. It plunged me into despair.
Utterly amoral.
Negative 300 million zillion stars.
I bought this book way back in '01, almost as a joke--it was so politically incorrect, but mostly for the stellar historical references-- remember, he who forgets the past is destined to repeat it.
Some great lessons from this book:1.
Learn to control your emotions.2.
Learn from your past.
4. Life is a game, don't take it personally.What I can't seem to learn is how to conceal my intentions, and play the role of a "courtier." That said, I can unconditionally and unequivocally recommend this book, just for the mini liberal arts "Western Civ" education you'll receive.
This book is not teaching anyone to be amoral.
It is teaching you how people really are in the real world.
If you don't want to be a deceitful heartless prick who does whatever he can to whomever all for personal gain, then I praise you.
However, YOU STILL NEED TO READ THIS BOOK to protect yourself from aforementioned amoral deceitful pricks.
Live your life as you see fit, but I always recommend facing reality in its purest rawest form, and this book really uncovers the seedy underbelly of how powerful people interact with one another.
Another good example of this is this book.
The other, more...what shall I say, interesting way is to wonder about something, investigate it, look at your findings and see what what you can make of it - even if you don't like what you find.The world, in my view, is moving - slowly - to a more beautiful way to think about power (Read Robert Greenleaf's The Servant Leader for starters, then read something like The Joy of Work by Bakke and, again, Collins' Good to Great where we find great leaders "looking out the window" when things go well and "looking in the mirror" when things go badly).
في مسلسل عربي، كان فيه واحد غنى بيدي موظف رشوة فالموظف بيقول له: بتديني رشوة؟ فالغنى بيقول له لأ دي مش رشوة دي عربون محبة ..
فالموظف قال اذا كان كده ماشي وأخدهاالكتاب ده الصح انك تسميه رشوة ..
لكن مؤلفه مسميه عربون محبةيعني الكتاب اسمه قواعد القوة ..
هي من أشد ما كان ينتقده عبد الوهاب المسيري في الغربأعتقد أنه لا توجد قاعدة بهذا الكتاب إلا وكانت هناك آية قرانية أو حديث شريف يأمرنا بعكسها أو على الأقل باجتنابهااذا أردت أن تصبح شخصا شريرا وقويا وربما غنيا ..
إذا أردت أن تكسب العالم وتخسر نفسك ..
قبل بدأ بالكتابة هذا ليس راي محايد و ليس موضوعي.انا منحازة جدا للوفاء و الأخلاص و الثقة و الصراحة و لكل القيم الفضلى .أي نعم انا عنيدة 😄😄 و رغم النصيحة اصررت على القراءة.لانني مثلي مثل اغلب أشخاص او النساء لا اعرف بضبط.حين يتملك بنا الافتتان بكاتب او الكتاب او اي الشئ.نرغب في تعرف عليه اكثر.ذلك م صار معي تعرفت على هذا الكاتب طبعا ليس في صالون او مكتبة😄😄 بل مع كتابه "فن الاغواء "نتيجة مراحعة مستفزة من احد اصدقاء الاعزاء "عبيد"* لا اعرف لم هذا الكاتب بذات حظي مع كتبه الاستفزاز السلبي او إيجابي .🤔فاعجبت به حد الافتتان لدرجة انني كتبت معلقة 😄😄 مو مراجعة على قول عبيد 😄😄.لذلك قررت قراءة له اكثر و وقع إختيار على هذا الكتاب.الذي بصدفة وجدت احد الرفاق و الزملاء اعطاه نجمة وحيدة يتيمة.و رغم نصحه لي بعدم القراءة و بين لي الأ سباب.
There are some engaging principles here that make you consider the principle of power from different vantage points -- This book is for those who already have a strong moral center as you find that the author meanders and introduces you to novel approaches to accquiring power --- often times at the expense of values.
If you're looking for a short-cut to get to the top and to compromise some values, then this may be the book for you.
Otherwise, I recommend books that are more humanistic and ethically aligned.

A book of wisdom, a compilation of tactics, hordes of to-avoid mistakes, rich set of brilliant tested ideas for thriving. Although many of the rules might seem devilish, they'd better be considered as lessons to be aware of in perilous social life. This book is unspeakably well written. Everyone can definitely benefit having it read for its lessons are ones that have been tested and utilized throughout the history by bold figures. I really enjoyed this book and learned an intense amount of knowledge.
This is really an unique book that serves both as a manual as well as a reading of the history of power and how it was used through the ages. I imagine most read this book to get insight into business transactions or self-help - but what is fascinating are the examples that are used to show certain aspects of obtaining or getting power. That and Robert's other two books "The Art of Seduction" and the War one are important studies on the nature of those subject matters.Really unique and interesting!
The book is little more than a collection of conflicting laws that are supported only by anecdotal evidence. Good for entertainment and historical vignettes but no real substance or takeaways here.
كيف تسيطر هذا الكتاب تجمّع لتجارب بشريّة على مدى 3000 آلاف عام، يلخصها روبرت غرين ويأخذ منها الزبدة في 48 قانوناً للقوة، إن طبقت هذه القوانين، فاستعد لتكون من أصحاب السطوة اللامتناهية.“لا تتفوق على رئيسك … لا تثق كثيراً باصدقائك … لا تعلن عن نواياك … تحدث دوماً بكلمات قليلة … اسحق خصمك تماماً … لا تتعلق بالأشخاص”.والكثير من القوانين الأخرى المشروحة ضمن قصص تاريخيّة حقيقيّة ستوضح لك المعنى والهدف من كل قانون. لا تفوت فرصة الوصول للسطوة والقوة الموجودة في هذا الكتاب. اترك كل شيء واقرأ سيعجبكم كثيرا .
My first thoughts while reading the preface were "Oh god...please don't let this be another book written from the point of view of an arrogant, self centered, self absorbed, narrow minded individual who only sees the world from his end of the spectrum, and believes that without his personal philosophy the rest of us mere mortals would be doomed!" I am pleased to say that I was TOTALLY wrong and pleasantly surprised.
As I dug deeper into this great work though, I found that the author's personal philosophy actually takes a backseat to the historical references and stories that would eventually take center stage and serve as an excellent way to prove his point and drive it home.
Robert Greene is educated as all get out and he puts it out there for everyone to see.
Greene, on the other hand, talks about everyone from ancient Chinese warlords to Talleyrand to Thomas Edison.
BUT, what Greene has to say has caught on in a lot of circles (I read a story about Robert Greene in the New Yorker where he was hanging out with both 50 Cent and the dude who started American Apparel, Dov Charney.
I wouldn't consider either of those guys my literary heroes or anything, but it is interesting that they have this fellow and his book(s) in common), and I think it's definitely worth reading.
يجب ان تتعلم كيف تغير شكلك من اسد الى نمر الى خنزير الى ضأن الى ثعلب الى شجرة الى ثعلب يرتدي ثوب الضأن...يجب ان تتصرف وتتكلم على غير ما تحب فليس من الحكمة ان تكون صريحا لان الحقيقة كريهة مؤلمة والحياة مليئة بالكآبة ولا احد يحب البؤساء لكن الجميع يحبون من يدخل البهجة على حياتهم من يخاطب عواطفهم وليس عقولهم لانه في بعض الاحيان ليس من الحكمة ان تكون عاقلا وسط الحمقى.
كن ودودا منفتحا لكن لا تظهر حقيقتك ابدا او نقاط ضعفك لانه سيتم استغلالها ضدك.
لا تتصرف بطريقة تثير فيها كرههم وغرائزهم الحيوانية ولا تخف لان لا احد يوقر الجبناء لكن الجميع يحترمون الشجعان.
To avoid any definitional debate and to put this review's foundation on the right track, POWER as used in this book needs to be defined.
Yes, that is the kind of power this book seeks to achieve.
If you're one seeking the generous and the warm kind, I would go as far to suggest that you instead read the succeeding selections, for this book is effective like that, it can change someone.
This book contains 48 laws of power to which one chapter is adroitly dedicated to the discussion of each law.
وبرغم ذلك كان ومازال الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم الكامل الكمال البشري رمزا في القوة والحكمة برغم انه لم يكذب يوما ولم يخدع ولم يكون له كبش فداء ولم يتميع ولم ينافق ولم يكن وصوليا ولم يعطي وعودا وهمية ولكنه كان قائدا بأمانته وصدقه وحب الناس له وذلك مما رأوه منه اذ كان لا يفرق بينهم ولم تكن له حاشية وكان يحكم بين الناس بالعدل والحق وكان بشوشًا متواضعا بسيطا يغضب لله ولا يغضب لنفسه كريم متسامح متفاهما ولا يوكل الامور الا لمن يقدر عليها ويكون اهلا لها لا يستغل شغف الناس بشيئ ولم يكيد المكائد ولم يستغل غفله الناس ..
I've seen many people disliking this book because it's evil.
What they do not understand that this book is meant to be evil.
I think the world is a horrible place because good people don't understand evil scheme, or can't plot evil scheme when its necessary to fight the evil.
As evil minds are generally ruthless in executing their schemes, they win most of the time.
To fight it, you must play dirty when necessary.
Law 4: Always say less than necessary.
Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people's self interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.
Most of us experience a much more fluid, shifting, and consensus-based form of power among people whom we must work with over and over again over many years and cannot afford to treat as disposable.
The book works very well as a history of how absolute power has been accumulated, preserved, and lost.
It works much less well as an set of instructions for how to exercise influence in a world where power is much more diffuse and unstable than it is in almost any of the examples that the author relies on as the basis for his "laws."
All of these examples are generally from like 900AD and involve politics from the 4th dynasty of Burma or some stupid irrelevant shit like that.The author has an attitude that everyone is a horrible person who is out to get you if you don't do so first, and his contempt for people seeps through when he constantly refers to people who don't play the power game as "fools" and "suckers".The only redeemable factor of this book is that you might more quickly identify the type of sociopaths who circlejerk over stuff like this in your workplace.
I couldn't stomach this book so to be fair I only finished about a quarter of it so I can't speak for the whole thing. A friend recommended it to me. It seemed to justify selfishness on these somewhat flawed ethics-based arguments. I think it's a recommended reading for business majors. Some folks love it. A good book to check out on power that takes a somewhat different approach is Thich Naht Hanh's "The Art of Power".
من بين الكتب القليلة الجريئة لحد الوقاحة في سرد حكايات أصحاب السطوة ، لا يخضع لشيء إسمه الأخلاق ، و أظن أن هذه القواعد أقسى من قانون الغابة .. أنصح بقراءته كما أنصح بعدم قراءته
