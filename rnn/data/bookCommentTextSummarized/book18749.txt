I demand a sequel to the prequel
So the only reason I picked this book up was in hope that it would redeem the series for me and answer my bajillion questions.
The Kill Order just failed to live up to The Maze Runner.I think the thing that bothered me the most about this book was that it was not about Thomas and the rest of the Gladers.
Sure, action is fantabulous, but there’s a limit to how much you can have in a single bookOverall, I just could not bring myself to enjoy The Kill Order, even though I enjoyed the first two books of the series so much.
[Conversation in the editing room]Remember all of the semi-likeable characters from the original series?  Get rid of them How about all the plot-holes from the first three books?

How about all the plot-holes from the first three books?
There's a  whole new expendable cast that provides quite convenient fodder and a  enough plot holes to bury all of them.The pacing of this book really threw me for a loop.
Every second of the book was spent in heart-pumping action.
Ugh. Incoherent rage.But seriously, when you are going to go for a science-based explanation for your series...you think it would begin by being rooted in...science.
What was the author thinking.
I would just like to say: How on earth can you rate this without even reading it?---It seems that I got an unexpected amount of 'likes' for this so-called review but I still don't get why people rate books without reading them. What are they thinking?Anyway, I don't think I'll be making a real review because I'm terrible at writing (as evidenced by my mistake before this edit: using the word anyways instead of anyway).

My first ever 1 star review.
Well done 'The Kill Order', you deserve it.
-I thought about giving up constantly.-The characters were boring, bland and flat-forced, vague and unnecessary relationships -stiff and unnatural dialogue-people dying before I could care, or remember who they were-inconsistencies in characterization (Being told a character never usually does something, and then they do it repeatedly!)-the plot fading away into ridiculousness-things just kept happening, but it all seemed pointless-the feeling that the author had a beginning and an end.
Or state the obvious -dreams that somehow show flashbacks in chronological order-telling me things instead of showing.
It's just that Dashner didn't provide me as a reader with nearly enough character development for me to care for the characters and what they're going through, or to like them.That being said, if you're the type of reader who just wants mindless action after mindless action, pick up The Kill Order - you won't be disappointed in it.
However, if you're a reader who values character development in books as opposed to action, The Kill Order won't be the book for you.
While I do consider myself the reader who values character development as opposed to action, I found The Kill Order to be a fun, thrilling, and quick read, but sometimes mindless action just isn't enough.
Now I enjoyed this book.
It's before the maze runner, I think it said 13 years.
Anyway, it was a pretty dark book.
I felt bad for this group and what was happening to them.
And holy crow, what those evil people did to Lana.
I mean they did evil things to a lot of people but this was one of the group and these freaks were off their nut!
Also at the very end we get to read about Thomas as a young boy before all hell broke loose in his world.
Either way I enjoyed it =)
3.5 ⭐This was a good addition to the series. It was quite action packed, with a whole new host of characters.We meet Mark, Trina, Alec and Lana, part of the human population who have survived the sun flares, but now face a new terror. They fight for their lives as an awful disease ravages the human race. No one knows where it came from, or why.Despite the constant action and violence, at times I felt it was almost too much. It relied heavily on the drama and excitement rather than actual plot.As
It was quite action packed, with a whole new host of characters.We meet Mark, Trina, Alec and Lana, part of the human population who have survived the sun flares, but now face a new terror.
They fight for their lives as an awful disease ravages the human race.
Like where the disease originated and what it's point was, which was really interesting to find out.It was a good read if you are in need of some excitement, and watching characters risk their lives constantly, it was a good space filler.
I'm going to vent, OK?(view spoiler)[ So first...where do I even freaking begin honestly.
They hardly even talked at all, and it hit me really hard when I realized that none of them even had the strength to try to help Mark when he fell out the window of the Berg.
(hide spoiler)]This book though, I can't even review this like my other ones because I'm filled with so many feelings and questions and angst right now.
DEAR GOD.
Honestly, I need to talk to him.
THIS BOOK IS A FREAKING, I DON'T EVEN KNOW, IT'S GOT THE FLARE.
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE FLARE, RIGHT NOW.
DNF at 47% "Mark jumped to his feet, pulling Alec's arm.
The entire area around them shook as it rose, and it took all of Mark's effort not to fall again.
He knew that what was happening had to be impossible, and it made him wonder about his mental state." I know that scene is supposed to have me at the edge of my seat, but the only thing I can think of right now is the lack of cheese sticks in my house, and that makes me wonder about my mental state.
After the fuckfest of The Death Cure, I wasn
I expected scientists running around like headless chickens trying to figure out the problem, while sweating world leaders tried to calm the masses.
I expected a grand mess in the footsteps of the The Stand, or on a smaller scale: The Mist.Instead, I get thrown in a world a year after all the excitement has happened.
No proper world-building, no excitement.
Or heels.Now I can finally rest in peace, knowing The Maze Runner series is genuinely a one-book wonder.
Bland characters, shitty world-building, mediocre writing.
Perhaps I will get my Teresa and Thomas fill when I read this prequel (gag).
_____________________________________________Who the heck are Mark and Trina??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????_____________________________________________If you think I don't care about Teresa and Thomas's past all that much (at least, before.
I'm so ticked off I can barely even look at the cover (which is pretty, by the way, but that's beside the point).______________________________________________________________One day I was actually browsing through my Kindle library store and found this book.
And then I was going to try reading it again because after some thought I decided that what a commenter said (view spoiler)[they all DIE!
(hide spoiler)] might actually be a breath of fresh air to read.
I don't know what other people thought, but this trilogy is one of the best I've read and I don't like this genre of book.
So I read it.And it was really effing good.
I can only assume that Deedee became Teresa, because of the epilogue.
If Deedee did in fact become Teresa, than it was nice to have this backstory.
I liked all these characters a lot - even Misty, Darnell and the Toad.
But the one character I really liked was Alec.
When he flew the Berg away for good, even when he got sick, my heart broke even more.
So disappointing. I liked the prologue and the epilogue, I felt the rest of the book was completely pointless except for the character Deedee and the explanation of the origins of The Flare. Which a whole book was not needed for those things. It was a ton of action which got really boring, and I just don't see the point of the story. It was fairly entertaining at times, but compared to the rest of the series it was pretty crappy.
First DNF of the year. I got to about 75 pages in and realized:  I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE PEOPLE Really that's it. I loved the Maze Runner books, devoured them back when they were released but I think this book is a perfect example of reading tastes changing over time.
He sido incapaz de pasar de la página 100. Pf se me ha hecho súper peñazo.
Had to DNF this at about 150 pages. I'm just not interested in the "Maze Runner" world anymore and the story didn't grip me at all. Meh.
Uninteresting. Disjointed. It could be easily confused with a fanfic.
I don't know probably more from WICKED* point of view, I wanted to get a better understanding as to why they decided to do everything that way.* Obviously, I'm not talking about WICKED, since it was not yet formed, I'm more exactly talking about the people who later created WICKED.Well, I didn't get that...Instead, I just got another survival story with non-stop action coming from characters i just couldn't care about.I hate it how they sometimes made stupid comments or actions just because the author wanted to give the impression that the characters cared about one another.For example, when they took that girl Deedee with them, and the two guys went to where her people went, after spying, the first thing they do is say "Why did you leave Deedee behind?

The Kill Order is the much anticipated prequel to The Maze Runner series by the incredible James Dashner.
He's the reason I found my love for post-apocalyptic/dystopic books which provoked me to want to read more in this genre.This installment takes place thirteen years prior to the initial time setting of the series, which was before Thomas and the Glade, and even before WICKED was created.
Fans of The Maze Runner trilogy are going to want to experience this prequel because it's a definite gem for their collection!I can't wait to see what James Dashner has planned next!(Arc provided by Netgalley and Random House Children's Books)This review and more can be seen at:

And the ending of the book.EW: The Plot..
This book tells us how the world came as it is in the maze runner.
And that kinda was a very good plot twist.
kinda bored with this book.
BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HER BETTER.Alec:This dude we get to know good.
I would want a person like him by my side in this world.
But also, i would have loved to spent more time with her.
And i do see Fox coming like "And we are gonna make this book into a tv-series" Which i would LOVEEEE.
No fue lo que esperaba, creí que iba a narrar todo el proceso de armado del laberinto y CRUEL, me sorprendió encontrarme con una historia independiente a Thomas y compañía, con personajes nuevos.También creí que todos los interrogantes que La cura mortal nos dejó iban a tener su respuesta, pero en el fondo sabía que Dashner no es de esos.
La única critica que tengo: Dashner, querido, las llamaradas derritieron los polos, destruyeron el planeta, pero no llegaron hasta el subterráneo en el que viajaban Mark y Trina.
Espero no tener pesadillas al respecto hoy, ya van dos días seguidos ^^UDashner logró lo que solo King había logrado, traumarme hasta las pesadillas.
There’s not much else I can do anymore, feeling like my life is a lie.I am a huge fan of The Maze Runner series so when I found out there was going to be a prequel I about had a heart-attack.
In short, it was as dry and boring as a stick in a dead forest.Dashner, I think it’s time to let The Maze Runner series go and write something else.
You mean you want me to read this?" *laughs evilly* I feel like the whole series was just let down by The Kill Order and with it, my respect and whole-hearted love.
Unlike all the other series instalments, this follows a different group of characters and deals with events separate to the WICKED experiments.The novel opens after the sun flares have ravaged the earth.
Just surviving is still the main objective of the central characters and this makes for very action-dominated reading.I know this is a source of contention with many but I really like how vague this series is on details.
All work together in salvaging whatever clues they can in an attempt to puzzle out the series of catastrophic events that befalls them.
I had read the Maze Runner series a while back, but had never gotten to this book because I hadn't thought that a prequel would be as enjoyable as the main series.Honestly, I do feel that my prediction was right. I flew through this book - I'm not sure why but it didn't draw me in the way The Maze Runner did.Could live with or without it.
Mmmmm..., no me gustó. Pesado, insustancial, un hastío interminable. Creía que Dashner con este libro me iba a dar las respuestas que no me dio en la trilogía. Pero no. En algunas partes es entretenido, eso tengo que aceptarlo; también tiene un buen inicio. Sin embargo, está lejos de ser considerada —en mi opinión— una buena novela.
SIKICI. SIKICI. SIKICI.
actual rating: 3.5 starsMark always loved Trina, even before the world ended.
One thing that the sun flares brought together: Mark, Trina.
He steals the spotlights through the whole book and I quickly grew really attached to him.James Dashner has the ability to make every single chapter important in their own way and I love that.
Dashner is one of my FAV authors and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending any of his books.
2.5.Esta primera precuela es el intento de James Dashner de crear un universo entorno a su saga El corredor del Laberinto, sin embargo, creo que lo que realmente hace es escribir libros de relleno.
El Destello es una novela que no me ha dicho nada y que quizá me haya mantenido enganchado a partir de la mitad de la novela, pero es totalmente innecesaria.
Hay acción por el simple hecho de tener acción y los personajes apenas están profundizados, exceptuando quizá, el duo protagonista.
Espero que la siguiente parte explique de verdad algo, porque en esta novela no se solventa...
I have to re-read this book. I'm like 85% sure I'm not going to like it as much the second time, but anyway.Quiero y no quiero releerlo, me gusto mucho la primera vez pero me urge hacerle una reseña decente XD y creo que con la re-lectura ya no me va a gustar tanto. Que pena, pero igual siempre tendré la trilogía original que adoro :D yei
