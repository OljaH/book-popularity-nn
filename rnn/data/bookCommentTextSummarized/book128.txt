Oh, how amazing indeed was this play!
I loved it to death.
It is a play in three acts, where it is discussed between a mother and daughter that their son/brother-in-law, John Middleton, is having an affair, with his wife Constance's best friend, Mary Louise Durham.
However, in the following act, the temptress' own husband discovers the personal effect of John, and accuses him in the full audience of his wife, Constance's family and close friend Bernard.
*inhale-exhale*I don't want to give away the rest, but one should REALLY watch/read this to find out Constance's reaction, her brilliant retaliation.
In Maugham’s play, a woman with the symbolically bourgeois name of Constance Middleton appears unwitting of her husband’s flagrant affair with Constance’s best friend, Marie-Louise Dunham.
Constance’s other friends, too, fear that the shock would be too great for her.Unbeknownst to all parties, Constance secretly knows all about her husband’s adultery.
And Constance proves that she who laughs last will laugh — and last — best.This dramatized audio version of The Constant Wife is nearly as good as having had a seat at the Tony Award-winning 2005 Broadway revival, as it has some of the same cast.

A copy of this play was shelved in the incorrect section at my local library, where I stumbled upon it and realized I’ve never read any of Mr. Maugham’s work.
I know nothing about the man, but I do know I really like this play.
What I adored about this play was the abundance of interesting female characters.
This is a play for actresses – not one or two, but a whole company of talented actresses, none of whom are wilting ingénues.
Those with a bent towards women’s rights should check out this play and decide for themselves whether its subversive feminism or horrifically chauvinist.

I've heard this book as a broadcast https://youtu.be/PsjYGywAxCI ...and it was really good... I really liked it.
Listened to an LA Theater Productions recording of this play and it was WONDERFUL! Great writing, fun, light story and great audio cast.
This is just so unexpected. More like Oscar Wilde than my concept of Somerset Maugham. This is not "The Painted Veil." This is hilarious, witty, and of course, true. Great cast, too. I listened twice to catch the things I missed while laughing.
The correspondent Wikipedia page lists such works as “Pygmalion” (some feminism – female fulfillment through marrying a twice-older professor and bringing him his paper and slippers every morning!) Pre-WWII (and of course pre-WWW) literature concerned with women’s situation in the society was largely concentrated on women’s sexual liberation (to some extent).
With this in mind, I am surprised to find in the list of early feminist literature things like Pygmalion or Awakening by Kate Chopin (which I do not find feminist at all, even though it is touted as one of the most important early feminist fiction pieces), and do not find the brilliant (and brilliantly written) “The Sacred Giraffe” or the above play by Maugham.
Loved listening to this play on audio. A very realistic experience of being inside the theater. The play is good and funny.
I was unsure whether I had read this play before or not - somehow I kept getting it mixed up with "Lady Windermere's Fan!" I also thought he was the author of "Tales of the City" (this confusion has an explanation - they sit right next to each other on the bookstore shelf).I enjoy the witty word-play and the strong female characters.
The titular character's view of marriage is a tad to harsh for me to accept in whole, but she makes plenty of valid points.
There are a few clumsy plot points, but on the whole I think it's a valuable piece of theatre literature.
A couple of Maugham's novels are among my favorites. There is a focus on a unconventional approach to life that I really like along with what I consider his excellent use of language.I like the language of the play and particularly enjoyed the first act, but then it almost seems to rely entirely on the unconventionality of Constance's approach to marriage, which I get early on and think is great, but it is not unconventional enough for me in the 21st century to to carry the whole play.
Written in 1926, this play is still engaging with clever word plays and dialogue. The dramatized audio version, which features Kate Burton (Richard Burton's daughter) as one of the main players, includes cleverly-timed exchanges, timeless questions to ponder about marriage, and a twist at the end. Highly entertaining!
The Constant Wife was an enjoyable story and was performed quite well by Kate Burton, Rosalind Ayres, and John de Lancie. I thought it was an insightful examination on the limitations that women had in marriage during that period. But, it was also quite funny and I did relish Constance's benign yet devilish manipulations.
This lovely two hour comedy reminded me of Oscar Wild's style. I laughed and found it rather enjoyable. The story begins by stating that everyone knows Constance's husband is having an affair but her. What she knows will surprise you, her unique views on infidelity will entertain you, and maybe even prove a fun topic for discussion. The end result is rather delightful. Enjoy!
Gate Theatre Tara Blaise as Constance, Susan FitzGerald in the role of Mrs. Culver and Stephen Brennan as Bernard. The stellar cast also included Simon Coates, Michael James Ford, Laurence Foster, Caitr�ona N� Mhurch�, Judith Roddy, Jade Yourell.
Very entertaining, I imagine this is how Oscar Wilde's writing would have ended up sounding had he lived another thirty years. A little less refined than Wilde but a little more contemporary in humor, obviously.
Recorded as a theater production. Very witty. Upper class period piece. Takes pointed jabs at philandering husbands through the personage of "The Constant Wife" . . . . appropriately named Constance. Enjoyed listening to this as theater.
Listened to the audiobook. The concept must have been radical when written but not outstanding in the modern era.
Outstanding! This play gets even better with age.
The audiobook version was entertaining. I recommend it for those looking for a lighthearted book. I cleaned the house while listening to it.
I thoroughly enjoyed the witty and clever play! It makes me wish that Maugham was still alive writing for us.
An excellent play, thoroughly post-modern and mature in its treatment of marriage and infidelity.
This story is in the style of Oscar Wilde, intelligent and witty. A very quick read with lots of laughs. I listened to it as a play on two CD's and found it most pleasurable.
Reminded me of The Importance of Being Earnest.
Short but funny. What a great tongue-in-cheek look at affairs within marriage.
Very short but very enjoyable read. Especially considering it was written 65 years ago.
Constance is a savvy lady! Some of the lines in this play were perfectly timed, and I would have loved to have seen them delivered. Smart.
