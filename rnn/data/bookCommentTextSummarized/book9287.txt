This is a great was to explore this artist's work, especially since here the introduction and the picture explanation are done by him (written before his death in 1972).
Each picture's description includes the title, type of work, date, measurements, and a comment of some length.Most of the pictures are black and white, some have color.
Some pictures are easy to understand with just a glance, some take a longer (enjoyable) time.This is a brief read, but the pictures are all great.
The type of repetition-work here was much fun to look at, some even for a longish while.
Like most high school and college students, I went through an Escher phase.
Without the aid of psychotropic substances or any sort of interest in vaguely mathematical patterns, mind you, so it didn't last long, but still, it happened, and this was the book I bought as it was going on.
And, you know, it's a reprinting of various Escher pieces.
At the time, I'd have probably rated it 5 stars, but now, it gets an "I'm no longer quite so impressed, but still appreciate the artistry involved" 3 star rating.
If you like this sort of thing, though, this is the sort of book you'll like.
Een mooi boek over Escher's werken. Ik heb eigenlijk niet echt de beschrijvingen gelezen die voor in het boek stonden, ik kwam voor de tekeningen. :P En die stelden zeker niet teleur. Er waren er zelfs een paar die ik nog niet kende, of die niet meteen een Oh, die, momentje aanwakkerde. Escher was echt briljant met zijn art, en dat allemaal zonder enig hulp van een computer, wat me nieuwsgierig maakt naar wat Escher nog meer had kunnen maken als hij nu nog had geleefd. :)Zeker een aanrader als je, net als ik, geinteresseerd ben in Escher's art.
I love that small children are drawn to this!
This book contains art along with comments from the artist explaining what he was trying to accomplish and where he felt he did well and not so well. His words add a lot to the appreciation of the well known images. It's a fun book that would be great to get again to study and try recreating.
Amazing combination of draw, math, shadow and creativity.
love travelling thru his art! magical!
This guy was a genious and every sketch is a challenge for your mind. Recommended to #analyse.
The album is overall good - high-quality print and it includes quotes from Escher himself.
What I didn't like was how the text and images are distributed throughout the album.
All descriptions are in one place (at the beginning of the album), and all the images are shoved after that.
If you want to read the description of only one specific print maybe you won't find this problematic, but if you want to read everything from start to finish it becomes too much of a hassle.After I read the album it still didn't become any clearer how Escher created his work.
I've always adored the works of M.C. Escher. This is a small, yet stunning collection which included many of my faves. His talent was unsurpassed & most impressive. Only thing that could've made it better would've been the size of the book. It was smaller than I expected, which is unfortunate considering the detail in each piece.
Un paio di anni fa li vidi dal vero, a una mostra a Roma, gli originali di Escher. Già nelle sue prime illustrazioni, realistiche, si intuisce qualcosa di come evolverà il suo stile e delle meraviglie che creerà.Per me resta uno dei migliori del XX secolo, meglio di artisti sopravvalutati come Picasso, Warhol o Matisse o Dalì.
Sanatçının kendi sunumu olması bence bir artı. Çünkü tam anlamıyla ne düşündüğünü ve yapıtlarını oluştururken nasıl bir yol izlediğini ilk ağızdan öğrenebiliyoruz. Bunun dışında alışılmış sanat kitapları gibi sanatçının yaşamıyla ilgili detaylı bilgi bulunmuyor, bunun bir eksi olduğunu düşünmüyorum.
Beautiful and fascinating.

All the illustrations were from Escher's "impossible" drawings. He fascinates a viewer with his imagination and perspective
