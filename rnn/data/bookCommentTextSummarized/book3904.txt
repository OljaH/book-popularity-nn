The ultimate Koine Greek resource!Bauer, W., W. F. Arndt, F. W. Gingrich and F. W. Danker (eds). Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature. Second edition. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979. “BAGD”.
"Read" is probably too strong a word, more like "used heavily as a reference book for several years"
" Use it daily. Extremely helpful. Could not imagine life without it. "Heavily used" not "read through".
Once you can figure out how to use this it is invaluable. Perfect for the word chaser out there.
BDAG is a top flight lexicon. Nuff said.
Look in the credits. I was the research guy.
The standard.
