What a set of horrific stories.
A very gripping narrative, full of suspense. Stories range from good old murder mysteries to essays on philosophy, not to forget the brilliant prose poems towards the end of the book. Poe was not only one of the most prolific writers of his time, but also, in my opinion, one of the most important thinkers of the 19th century.
