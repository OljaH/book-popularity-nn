** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED **A Beautiful Wedding  was passionate, emotional, and a whole lot of fun. In this beautiful novella, Jamie McGuire reminded me once again why Travis Maddox is and always will be my favorite bad boy.   “A Maddox boy will take you all the way to the edge, but if you go with him, he’ll follow you anywhere…And when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever.”  Even though it had been over a year since I read Beautiful Disaster, I reconnected with the characters right from
It was a beautiful and wonderful way to revisit characters who already had a special place in my heart.My favorite thing about Travis and Abby has always been how strongly they love each other, how they're not afraid to show that love, and how what they each want most is each other's happiness.
It truly was beautiful!If you're a fan of Travis and Abby, this novella is a must read!
To this day, Beautiful Disaster holds my record for the most re-reads ever.
It may have started off with me wanting to punch Abby in the face, but it ended with acceptance.
I also noticed one small discrepancy in one of the scenes, but it is so small that I'm sure the ONLY reason I noticed it was because of the uncountable re-reads I did of Beautiful Disaster.
If you haven't read Beautiful Disaster yet, first off, congratulations on coming out of your coma.
Second, READ THIS SERIES!If you already have, A Beautiful Wedding is NOT one to miss!READ ON!

”Did that just really happen?” I asked.
”Did I see misty eyes back there?”

A Beautiful Wedding follows Abby and Travis from the moment they become engaged, until a year after the wedding.
I know she loves him and just wants to protect him, but I really thought it was because she loved him so much, after the fire and facing death, she couldn’t imagine a life without him.
Loved the texting between Trav and Abby-I miss u I miss u too T-minus one hour.
When u c me u will want to marry me 4 sure.
Ducking Fucking* goddamn auto correctA really great, feel good read!
"“One down, forever to go,” I whispered back."~~~~OH MY FUCKING GODDDD!!!!!*hyperventilates*I think I just got a mini stroke!!!!I CANT BELIEVE MY OWN EYESDEC 10TH 2013THATS ME ^^ and I am going to call all my friends who love Travis and spread the scream!!!
Español - EnglishEste libro era total y absolutamente innecesario.En lugar de aportar lo que hace es poner en duda cosas que ya se daban por sentadas. ✨✨✨This book was totally and absolutely unnecessary.Instead of contributing what it does is to question things that were already taken for granted.
This was about what I expected it to be - a bit on the cheese side, had some offenses to offer to the table (misogyny chiefly, but even very few instances of casual racism...fun times, not.) But believe it or not, Travis was probably more tame in this narrative than he was in either Beautiful Disaster or Walking Disaster (didn't mean he lacked annoying points).Abby on the other hand...I'll talk about it in the full review.
This novella show us what happened between Abby’s proposal in Beautiful Disaster and their actual wedding.If you all resented not seeing Travis get married now’s your chance!
I didn’t gave it five stars for one simple reason: Abby.
I will not pretend I liked the reason why she decided she wanted to marry him, because I really didn’t, but oh well, it all turned good in the end so I can live with it.
Anyway, I you liked the previous books, you have to read this beautiful novella.
TRAVIS IS HERE AND I'M IN LOVE AGAIN!  "The only thing I'm afraid of is a life without you, Pigeon"  Travis and Abby's wedding journey was beautifully written! I wish it was a novel instead of novella! TRAVIS IS TRAVIS!!!  Happy reading!

OKAY so I'm not a huge fan of novellas, but it's Travis, so enough said.
You know that Abby Abernathy unexpectedly became Mrs. Maddox.
But what do you really know?Why did Abby pop the question?What secrets were shared before the ceremony?Where did they spend their wedding night?Who else knew about it .
and didn’t tell?Everything about Abby and Travis’s elopement was top-secret .
Fans of Beautiful Disaster and Walking Disaster will get all of their questions answered in this whirlwind tale of the wedding day (and night!)—and as with all good stories, this one will definitely have been worth the wait.
Other than that punch to my bleeding heart everything feels complete now :) And as always, anything that includes a Travis Maddox is always treasured and loved dearly.
Travis was one of my very first book boyfriends, therefore he will always have a special place in my heart.
If you loved Beautiful Disaster and Walking Disaster as much as I do, you really won't want to miss out on this one.
“I want you to know that whatever love is, this has got to be it.
"We're forever.”“And when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever.”
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, here are my top ten reasons why I won't be reading this:10) I don't want to know what's going on in Abby's head.
I already read her POV in Shitty Disaster and know that it's probably nothing than oogling at Travis's hot bod.9) Besides everyone knows that most people only get married in Vegas if a) they're drunk, b) a celebrity, c) impulsive, d) trying to be hipster ironic, or e) live there.
I read Beautiful Disaster back in 2011 and I remember it being a drama filled, angsty romance that captured my heart and wrung it out!
Getting a dual POV is what I wanted in Beautiful Disaster, so I was thrilled to get it here.While I enjoyed some of this novella, parts of it undid the positive feelings I had about their marriage.
The way things are left in Beautiful Disaster you’re left to think Abby and Travis getting married impulsively is because they are so crazy in love.
2 Stars! Did she love him, or didn't she...that's what I'm wondering?!...and the point of this book was what?! To make up things and make what was a beautiful, but complicated love story a disaster?! I don't get it. I'm sorry, but I think I should have left this one on the shelf. Maybe I'm just too old for this kind of read.
Ok now I just feel greedy. Greedy needy and gluttonous. Just when I thought I just couldn't get enough of Travis .... It's come. The time has come. Travis my first book boyfriend has his HEA and I'm leaving this series ❤ happy ❤.  “I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn’t something about you at all. It was just you.”  Travis leaned in, squeezing my hand as he whispered, “Happy anniversary, Pidge.”I looked into his eyes, as full of love and hope

Greedy needy and gluttonous.
Just when I thought I just couldn't get enough of Travis ....
It's come.
The time has come.
Travis my first book boyfriend has his HEA and I'm leaving this series ❤️ happy ❤️.
“I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.
It was just you.”  Travis leaned in, squeezing my hand as he whispered, “Happy anniversary, Pidge.”I looked into his eyes, as full of love and hope as they were the year before.
“One down, forever to go,” I whispered.
BUT i ended up loving it like the rest of the series..After all we are talking about Travis-f@cking-Maddox..
Travis was as always amazing, with such a heartwarming behaviour, ready to show her how much she means to him in every step of the way..The weddings were great, i had a chance to see some of my fav characters from the previous books and i loved almost everything in this one..
Antes: Abby es la chica más afortunada. La envidio tanto. Ojalá todas pudiéramos tener a alguien como Travis Maddox. Quiero uno para mí. En serio, este tipo es PERFECTO. Morí con cada palabra de amor de Travis hacia Abby. Ahora:Tengo ganas de golpear mi cabeza contra algo, ya que esas palabras que estaban en mi anterior reseña son pura basura, al igual que todos los libros de esta serie. La primera vez que leí Beautiful Disaster pensé que había leído la historia más maravillosa. Me avergüenzo de
Morí con cada palabra de amor de Travis hacia Abby.
Ahora:Tengo ganas de golpear mi cabeza contra algo, ya que esas palabras que estaban en mi anterior reseña son pura basura, al igual que todos los libros de esta serie.
La primera vez que leí Beautiful Disaster pensé que había leído la historia más maravillosa.
Deben entenderme: era joven y estúpida, y BD era la primera novela young adult que leía (BD no debería ser catalogado como young adult.) Así que pensé que Travis era perfecto.
Buddyread με την υπέροχη Μαρ ❤Μια πανέμορφη ιστορία έφτασε στο τέλος της. "One down, forever to go."
It was like we were getting ready to jump of the highest high dive into the deepest river that fed into the most magnificent, terrifying waterfall, right onto the best and most fantastic roller coaster in the universeThe wedding and renewal of vows ...
simply beautiful ♥I want you to know that whatever love is, this has got to be it.
We were best friends first, and we tried not to fall in love, and we did anyway.
This whole thing might play out to be a completely wonderful, beautiful disaster, but I want that if it's with youIt might take a lifetime to prove to everyone that this works.
***2 Not On Board With This Stars***I'll just make this short and sweet:Since I work in law, I can't get on board with a book that delivers the message that if you REALLY love someone it's OK to tamper with a police investigation and commit perjury in order to save your loved one from the accountability of their involvement in the matter. Sorry, Jamie McGuire but
Did not like Abby's reasons for marrying Travis.
All the things we didn't know about Abby & Travis' wedding!  Likes: • Travis! How could you not like him? He is sooo sweet and romantic and has definitely grown up!• My heart went out to Abby even though I didn't like the reasons she wanted to get married, I like that she wanted to protect Travis so fiercely! • ♬ Their song! ♥• The letter...OMG, definite tearjerker moment!• The tattoo but the guy was a jerk!• Sorry America, I liked Vegas better! Dislikes: • Wow, I really didn't like the reas
He is sooo sweet and romantic and has definitely grown up!• My heart went out to Abby even though I didn't like the reasons she wanted to get married, I like that she wanted to protect Travis so fiercely!
♥• The letter...OMG, definite tearjerker moment!• The tattoo but the guy was a jerk!• Sorry America, I liked Vegas better!
• Wow, I really didn't like the reasons Abby wanted to get married and that she didn't tell Travis!
There's just something about Travis that I want to read more of so I'll probably read everything that's written about them ~or~ about the brothers.
Before starting this book, I told myself over and over that this was REDEMPTION for McGuire. (Should it turn out to be a good read.)Walking Disaster wasn't up to par. Friend: A Walking Disaster is amazing! You'll love it. Me: *AFTER READING* There was no redemption for Walking Disaster. This novella was worse than WD. I literally skipped through most of the lengthy paragraphs just to get to the dialogue. It seemed like I was reading filler/previous events that had transpired in Beautiful Diaste
(Should it turn out to be a good read.)Walking Disaster wasn't up to par.
Then the chapter title for Chapter six...And then the damn discussion in the limo about how Jon Bon Jovi got married in the same chapel (Graceland.)And Travis' mother's note "Thank you for loving my son" ect...
(This author ruined Travis Maddox for me.)Nothing felt right in this book.
Abby explains that she lied for Travis and he got away with going to jail.
Another book with Travis Maddox?
Walking Disaster was almost the exact same (with a little Travis persona added in) and in the end I was disappointed.
I'M ALREADY PREDICTING 5 STARS!You're cordially invited....OMG!!!! A Travis & Abby WEDDING NOVELLA! My dreams have come true!
:) Es un libro muy lindo, tierno y desgraciadamente corto, pero vale la pena leerlo.
Muy recomendable para los que leen la saga.
Contiene Spoilers para los que no leyeron Beautiful Disaster/Walking Disaster!!!!Reseña:Este libro nos muestra en detalle el día de la secreta boda de Abby y Travis, además, nos responderá ciertas preguntas… ¿Por qué Abby le propuso matrimonio a Travis?
Narra todo lo que no pudimos leer en BD ni WD desde los dos puntos de vista.
Hay una escena en particular que es muyyyy divertida jeje.El epílogo es demasiado lindo, pero no quiero decir mucho así se sorprenden.
3.5 Getting Hitched Stars!In this little novella, we get to find out the reason why Abby popped the question to Travis. Peronally, I wasn't all that thrilled with her. I get why she did it but come on, this is Travis!! At the end though, I was okay with it. Loved that the POV was both Travis and Abby. Love being inside Travis's head. I will take all of the Travis I can get!  A Maddox boy will take you all the way to the edge, but if you go with him, he'll follow you anywhere.And when a Maddox bo

AHHHHHHHHH MORE TRAVIS!!!! -drool-
This is a short story on Abby and Travis’s Las Vegas elopement!! It was nice to get a peak at how their wedding all went down! I enjoyed getting more time with one of my favourite book boyfriends!If you loved Travis Maddox in Beautiful Disaster, then you want to read this for sure!
3.5 "Short,cute, sweet, emotional" Stars i loved it, it’s filled with the kind of moments that leave you smiling and warm-hearted from beginning to end. :D . in this book we learn how and why Travis and Abby were engaged and married six months after they met “I want you to know that whatever love is, this has got to be it. We were best friends first, and we tried not to fall in love, and we did anyway. If you’re not with me, it’s not where I want to be. I’m in this. I’m with you.”
