Won this from Goodreads. The family of the author is re-releasing the Detective Ormsberry Series. This is the second book in the series, originally published in 1929. It was a fun, traditional, historical whodunit. I appreciated the footnotes defining words more commonly used during that era. I would like to read more of these.
The Clue of the Second Murder In this, the second of John Stephen Strange's 22 mysteries, Mrs. Tillett has crafted an intriguing tale. Mystery readers will really enjoy this detective story featuring Bill Adams, teen sleuth, and his detective friend set in Greenwich, Connecticut in the Spring of 1928. A Packard automobile, a lavish estate, and courtroom drama! I personally really enjoyed working on it.
