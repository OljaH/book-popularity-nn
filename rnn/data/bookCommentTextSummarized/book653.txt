"And no one knows, at sight a masterpiece.And give up verse, my boy,There's nothing in it." This is an interesting early published piece by Ezra Pound.
It is a semi-autobiographical retelling of how Pound first got into the poetry business, but also an early tribute to The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock by his pupil turned muse: T.S. Eliot.
This is where Pound started to get his signature style that he would modify and build on for the rest of his career.
"The face-oval beneath the glaze,Bright in its suave bounding-line, asBeneath half-watt raysThe eyes turn topaz."
It surprises me to think just how annoying this poem is.
It doesn't read like a nostalgia for classcial beauty, but like an unnatural obsession.It is no big news that modernists had unlocked level crazy when it came to acting stuck-up.
So Pound is hell-bent on proving how no one knows a shit about beauty and how he is burdened under the weight of not letting the classics die in this age of intellectual "peasants".
He wouldn't laugh, he will wrinkle his nose and shut his eyes, and then blabber in Greek that everyone is blind to beauty.
Captivating poem. Now if I could just figure out all of its cruxes...
An interesting, apparently autobiographical, read. I liked it, but it didn't stun me.
6/10
I had to read this short "book" or collection of poems for college and I didn't enjoy it even the slightest bit. I don't know if it was because I really am not a poetry person or because it actually made no sense at all. Maybe someday I'll get to enjoy this, maybe not but absolutely not a fan.
Ah, alas what can I say? I was totally lost in the understanding of this work. Possibly because I have never studied literature to such a depth that this would require. Perhaps when I become more literate I will be able to appreciate this work as others have, one can only hope.
