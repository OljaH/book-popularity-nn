3.5*She's kinda dumb... and she's gonna be relevant for the rest of the series.I have a prediction for Nina. There was the whole Jason reveal at the end with Luke and the adults. I'm guessing she going to be a thorn in Luke's side later on. She gonna screw them over because she's stupid. There are enough hints in this where I could see her becoming a betrayer. I mean she went back and forth on doing the right thing so many times.
I'm short on time again today, so, this will be quick: This was another exciting entry in this series.
In her holding cell she meets three other children, Alia, Percy, and Matthias.
Nina finds the poisoned guard's keys and escapes with Alia, Percy, and Matthias.
One day Lee finds Nina stealing food and takes her to Mr. Harlow.
Now she, Lee, Mr. Talbot, and the other three children are working to overthrow the population police.The main characters are Nina, Percy, Matthias, and Alia.
Nina is a young girl who makes the population police believe she is helping them.
She trusts Nina the most out of the three children.The setting of the story starts off in a holding cell in the population police prison.
Erst dachte ich, dass es sich hierbei nur um einen Zwischenteil der Grundgeschichte handelt und war etwas entäuscht, aber die Fäden finden sich zusammen und so bin ich doch sehr froh ein wenig mehr von Nina Idi, einem der Schattenkinder, zu erfahren. Ich glaube, dass sie im weiteren Verlauf noch eine größere Rolle spielen könnte. Ich bin gespannt ob ich recht habe ;))Also auch dieser Teil konnte mich überzeugen. Da es eben eher eine Dystopie für jüngere Leser ist, ist die Sprache und der Aufbau natürlich sehr leicht gehalten, aber für zwischendurch ist es richtig toll.
Awesome book. I loved it. Its about this girl who has to decide whether or not to betray these three young kids. She makes the choice to help them and is on a long journey, with these really smart kids, to find a safe home to stay, in the shadows hidden from the rest of the world.
Among the Betrayed The main character is Nina, and she is the third born child in her family. Nina is illegal, because she is the third born of her family, and third born children are illegal, because it is hard times where she lives. Nina used to live with her aunt’s, but she got caught. For third born children to try and not get caught, people make fake ID’s for them to try and help them. The book is about a girl, (Nina), who gets caught being an illegal, and she is then thrown in prison. The

Guards come into Nina’s cell with a recorder, and they play it back to her, and it is Jason, her friend, blaming Nina for everything.
Then, Nina gets put into a cell with three other children.
It was all fake, the guards, and the three children.
this book is good because Nina is another shadow child and is actually with luke from the first book and luke doesn't know that she is a like him but she doesn't know if she should luke but IDK if she knows likes real name isn't lee grant luke is trying to say to say he can help her. this book is good because I like the series of the among the shadow children and all of these books mostly have action and its interesting
Readers of the first two books, and it definitely is a plus to have read these first, will themselves not be sure whether to trust Nina.
Nina, held and questioned by the Population Police in a not-too-faraway America ruled by an authoritarian government, isn't sure whether she trusts herself.
The bleakness is leavened by the resiliency and hope of her young (and well-drawn) characters.
Lots to think about and discuss for young readers in short books that are easy to read.
I loved this book!
At the beginning I felt it was a little boring and could of had more detail, but I loved the twist ending so much it definitely deserves 4 stars!
This book had lots of action and included a lot of twist and turns I did not see coming.
At first I thought it would be a bad book because it was in Ninas point of view but I was completely wrong!
If anything it made the book better.Plus this is my favorite cover for this series-very cool!A great addition to the Shadow Children series!
Nina is an illegal third child and has been living a false life at a school for girls.
Nina agrees to make a deal with the Population Police in order to have her life spared.
When Nina and the others are on the run the same feeling of survival is also felt throughout the book.
Nina wants to betray the others to survive even though she knows it is the wrong thing to do.
I also think that the book is great for both genders because it has a female main character, but it also has a lot of action.
She goes to the girls only school but ends up meeting some people from the boys only school.
Jason has a plan to work with the people who take care of third children, they are called the population police.
That plan didn't work.They both went to prison and this man pretended to be a population police person but was really a good guy who faked all of it to see if Nina could prove whether or not she was on their side.
After Jason, Nina, and some other kids get “caught” the book takes place at the population police prison.
The kids and Mr. Talbot revealed that it was all just a test to see if she was trustworthy.CharacterizationThe main character, Nina, changed quite a bit throughout the book.
The setting impacted this book by making Nina try to escape from the population police.
The setting required Nina to make life or death decisions, like asking if the other kids wanted to leave the prison with her boarding school.Thematic ConnectionThe main theme of this book was a desire to escape.
It started out with her wanting to escape the population police and be free without any worries.
Nina has a friend named Jason who also is a shadow child with a fake identity who went to the school for boys.
Percy is nine, Matthias is ten, and Alia is six.The background behind the first two books in the sequence is that families are only allowed to have two children because of the shortage of food.
At the start of “Among the Betrayed” the book takes place at the Population Police Prison when Nina wakes up in a prison cell.
Nina gets moved to a cell with Alia, Matthias, and Percy.

The age group this book is intended for is intermediate readers.
The book talks about the government controlling the population by only allowing two children per family.
If families had any more than two children, they would be executed; so, many families hid the children known as shadow children or exnays.I like how this book was written.
I like how the younger characters knew to use the sun for direction and time.
It was hard to believe that the government would execute innocent children just for being born, but it showed desperate times called for desperate measures.
I think this is a good book for young readers.
I really enjoyed this young adult series and it made me look for more books by the author.
She and the other three kids escaped the prison and ended up in the woods near Hendricks School for boys.
She later was tested by the Hating Man, who was actually trying to help her.
The Hating Man was the head of the prison that Trina was put in, but he was actually a double agent.
The Three kids where there to help out The Hating Man on his test to Trina.
They were also there to guide her on her ways.Setting It started out in the prison where Trina and her friends escaped, so they could go to get good food.
When presented with a means of escape, she is forced to make a decision that will affect all their lives: does she escape on her own, knowing the other three children will die, or does she take them with her and hope for the best?
As crucial decisions are made, danger ramps up.
Nina meets old acquaintances and meets new people who may or may not factor in her decision.
Among the Betrayed gives us more clues in the Shadow Children series, but many questions remain...where does it all go from here?
Haddix switches gears here, telling a story that occurred at the end of Among the Impostors and overlaps it.
The main character switches to Nina, leader of the thirds at the girls' school, about whom we know next to nothing.
Most of the story occurs in a Population Police Prison.Haddix does a great job of revealing how a situation like a political prison would work, especially when you add intrigue within the prison itself, and the Population Police.
That's critical in a story where one of the main messages is "people matter" ;)
I really enjoyed this book, just as I enjoyed the first two books in this series. It is a good sequel to the first two books. However, I did enjoy the first two a little bit more because I feel as if the plot was more developed and interesting in "Shadow Children" #1 and #2, especially in #1. All in all, among the betrayed is definitely worth reading and is an overall good book.
I liked this book. This book was about a girl who had been captured by the population police because the law in her country was that a family was only allowed to have 2 kids. Nina, the main character of this book was accused of being a third child and was turned into the police. This book was pretty good, I would read it again. I recommend this book, especially if you want a quick read book.
I remember this being my favorite book in the series when I was younger.
I had a really good book here and I liked all of the action and scary stuff that has happened to her. I really like this series and no there super cool.
this book is really different form the first and second books it wasn't in Luke's point of view it was in Nina but you must read the first and second book to find out more
Is really good it is a series.
This book is about a girl named Nina she is a 3rd child and your not aloud to have more than 2 kids and she has to hid and never come out of her house because if she gets coat then she will die.
I really liked this book because there was a lot of entertainment in it.
And it was really easy to follow so I really liked that because I hate when books are really hard to follow.
I have read all of the books to this series and this book was my favorite one.
The hating man makes Nina a deal if she could find out that the other three kids where illegals he would spare her life.
They all live in the woods for a few weeks until one night while picking from the garden, Nina gets caught by two boys and is taken into the cabin with the hating man again.
Jason was Nina’s first love but her betrayed her and told the Population Police about her and she was sent to prison.
These three kids have a lot of knowledge about the real world and the Population Police.
I also liked how the author added the right twists at the right time to keep readers reading till the very end.Plot Summary:Nina is the fake name that was given to Elodie when she went off to school at Harlow's.
The four go to Hendricks to seek help from a friend named Luke.
Luke tells them to go to Mr. Hendricks and they find him with Mr. Talbot who reveals himself to be the officer that was interrogating Nina.
Mr. Talbot also tells Nina that he is working on the inside of the population police to tear it down.
I think if she would have gotten a fake identity she would have been free and not been caught.PlotNina was put into prison by the population police.
In the same cell as her were three other children that were also caught by the population police.
Nina stayed with the children and they escaped from prison.
This meant all children that were not one of the first two born in their family, had to stay under the radar of the population police.
This book would also be a good one for people that like adventures because Nina is always on the move trying to avoid the population police.
Still simple to read and understand.Plot: Nina from the girl's school got arrested for being a shadow child.
He gave her all type of banned good food and he told her she will get let go if she got the trust of the 3 other people and betray them.
After like a week later, the head master set up another meeting with her and she couldn't get any information from the other kids.
Nina was taking things from the garden and Luke caught her and brought her to the headmasters house.
She was ready to help them free the shadow kids.Characterization: Nina: Girl from the all girl's school.
Personal response: Among the Betrayed was a great read and I enjoyed the book greatly.
Plot: Among the Betrayed was an amazing book about how Nina got locked up by the population police.
Now they have to take down the Population Police and get free.Characterization: Nina was a very shy girl to start this book and didn't really know what the right decision was in certain cases.
The setting played a huge roll, because to start the book Nina was in jail and her actions were very little and she could barely tell when it was day or night time.
