There's no way to say a date for when I finished reading Hazan. I'm always reading Hazan. I own several of her other books, but this the one I always come back to. I learned so much from her, much in the same as in earlier years I learned so much from Julia Child's Volume I and II. You can't go wrong with her. While it is true some newer cookbooks may come up with some versatile shortcuts, with Hazan you know you're on a solid path to doing it well. And she's fun.
Just rediscovering this one. The escarole soup remains so delicious. How can five ingredients add up to something so good? And the artichoke and squid soup...or is that in vol. 2?

Try the gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce.
A useful addition to my library, and a pleasurable one too. This and Hazan's second volume are easy to use, clearly useful, and usually produce a successful resul.t
These are elegantly simple recipes. The brilliance appears to be in the details of the preparation/cookig rather than the use of exotic or numerous ingredients.
Excellent. I never tire of Marcella's recipes which I've been making for 35+ years now.
The best Italian cookbook ever. Ragu and Pesto to die for.
A gem!
Its got all the basics, sadly, I have the paperback and its falling apart and print is too tiny for my almost 50 eyes - but I pretty much know what I"m doing
Reading this cover-to-cover. It's that good.
Lots of good authentic recipes
This book is easy to follow, and the ingredients pretty easy to come up with, all things considered. I've had much joy and tasteful adventures so far in its pages, and expect that will continue.
You can't go wrong with Marcella Hazan. Her recipes are foolproof. I've made her egg plant Parmesan so often I know it by heart.
One of my three favorites. You just can't go wrong with this cookbook.
