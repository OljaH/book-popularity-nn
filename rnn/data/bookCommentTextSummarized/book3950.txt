This 6th instalment of the Hardy Boys is an exciting story of car theft full of mystery adventure, misadventure and fun. The authors were apparently quite proud of it because in the next volume 7, The Secret of the Cave, it is mentioned on nearly every other page. It is probably in my top 3 Hardy stories and a fun, exciting read. Frank and Joe are always fun to follow and as always there are cliff-hangers aplenty. Good luck getting your son to go to bed between chapters!
Fun Stuff!! Last night Hubby and I enjoyed a cozy, retro date-night eating Olive Garden takeout while listening to The Shore Road Mystery. I loved the added sound effects and the suspense-enhancing music, like that of radio days gone by. And screen actor Bill Irwin did a marvelous job reading/enacting the story. Such a delightful evening! It's the simple things in life that bring the greatest joys. FIVE-GAZILLION ***** Super Fabulous, Retro Date Night ***** STARSFOUR **** Classic Fun, Hardy Boys ***** STARS
It was a very intriguing book. I would definitely recommend it. I took so many turns that I did not expect and it kept on surprising me. The Hardys are strategic in the way that they work and it was very interesting to read about their plans. It was in third person. I would have liked it if it was in first person. I think it would have had a nice twist to it.
I just want to go on the record as saying that if the Hardy Boys were actually hit on the head and knocked unconscious just the number of times they are in this book, they would have significant brain damage. Seriously.This one was extremely twisty - I didn't put together all of it until the end myself. A fun read so long as you don't take it too seriously.
The duo detectives are off to find hidden treasure in this addition to the book series.
We are 3/4 of the way through, and the Hardy's have been gassed once, almost poisoned by carbon monoxide, nearly run over by a station wagon, nearly decapitated by a wire strung up across the paths of their motorcycles, knocked out twice, nearly run over by a combine, and nearly drowned. I can't understand why Fenton still encourages his boys to be in this business, and why does Mrs. Hardy and Aunt Gertrude just smile and bake cakes? They must be on a combination of welbutrin and valium.
Great fun to read these classics, that I never read as a child. Very intricate stories and well plotted to appeal to the adult, and great fun and adventures for the child.
I liked this book in this book frank and joe bye a car and let it get stolen with them in side it.
I read the Hardy Boys books (and Nancy Drew) when I was a child. The stories are old fashioned, but that's why I like them so much.
Continuing my project to re-read the 190 Hardy Boys books of my youth, I delved into The Shore Road Mystery.
A note on the inside cover of my copy indicated that I read it way back in 1982 and I remembered it as one of the better of the 58 classic hardcover stories.
My memory did not fault me, as Hardy Boys tales go this is one of the best.
Smugglers, kidnapping, shore-side intrigue and a long lost historical treasure all come together in this fast-paced exciting book.
If you like Hardy Boys books, The Shore Road Mystery is one of the best!!
A better than average mystery about a car theft ring that (as always) ties into a case the Hardy Boys' Father is working on.
Like the rest of the better novels, this had Chet around for not just comic relief, but to contribute knowledge from his latest hobby which just happens to be useful.
In this mystery, Chet actually stopped the main bad guy from getting away with his study of seaweed.
If you are looking for a series of books for your pre-teens or middle-school kids to read, this is a good choice.
They also work as bedtime reading for younger kids.
Frank, Joe and their friends always seem to amaze me by continuing to live after getting hit on the head so many times! In this book, they are on the hunt for car thieves. As always, this book is full of adventure and excitement. I just love the Hardy Boys! I highly recommend this series to everyone.
As more and more cars are stolen along a specific road outside the town, Frank and Joe decide to help their friends and investigate just who could be running this huge ruse! Dixon will please readers with this entertaining entry to a classic series!
Greatest mystery series ever!I loved this book because of the action!I would recommend this to someone who likes mystery books, maybe a Sherlock Holmes fan.I chose this rating because of the cleverness!
What a great Hardy Boys mystery! Things really move in this one with a cliff hanger at almost every ending chapter! Wonderfully written with great plot development, I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good spooky mystery!
This book is much like the previous Hardy Boys books in that it’s a fun, suspenseful adventure that is entertaining and morally wholesome. I also like the glimpse into a former (and in some ways better) time period in American history.
It was fun reminiscing. I loved the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books as a kid, so had to give this a listen when I saw it in the digital audio library. It was a pleasant way to spend some commuting time, but I probably will leave it at one book rather than catch up on the series.
Most intriguing mystery so far in the series. a definite contender for top 3 Hardy Mysteries and no.1 in the first 6 mysteries
Another exciting adventure with the Hardy boys, their friends, and famous detective Fenton Hardy. Aunt Gertrude makes some amusing appearances and gets Chet's goat a couple times.
I would never have the guts to actually set foot in a yard full of criminals. At last i got to hear of Fenton fight beside his children. How sweet. Loved it
This book was kind of boring and I lost interest in it
The criminals here just don’t seem like adults - so why have these Hardy’s solving adult mysteries? International gun smuggling? Poison gas? Murder? Come on Dixon...
Ate these things up as a kid back in the '60's. Now, they're quite dated.
Toward the end it gets really suspenseful but is still a really good kind of suspenseful.
I love The Shore Road Mystery! That spider outfit on the cover is badass. This was a great little read.
Frank and Joe Hardy, and their chunky brother from another mother Chet Morton, combine forces to battle a gang of nefarious car thieves/arms dealers, who also take time to kidnap the Hardy's standard rube friends and search for Pilgrim Pirate treasure.
Several scenes feature Frank, Joe, Chet, Italian friend Tony Prito using any excuse to strip to the waist and dive into Barmet Bay. If memory serves, the boys are never described getting dressed again, leading one to imagine them walking through town, fighting bad guys, and sitting down to dinner with Mrs. Hardy and eternally bitchy Aunt Gertrude in their sopping wet boxers, perhaps revealing the predilections of the ghost writer for this particular installment.
Prior to reading "The Shore Road Mystery": it was such a familiar name to my Dad and I; we thought it must be a famous volume.
It was infinitely more intriguing than car theft.
"in high gear"!The writing formulas glare too repetitively for those who read a few of one series' novels.
I know the history of the Stratemeyer company, which makes it hard to tell if this rubber stamp was the author, Leslie McFarlane's doing.
It kept me curious, that we couldn't tell who orchestrated the thefts.
Initially, I thought it odd that so many cars would be stolen under the police's nose.
This book lost out to Lemony Snicket’s tales of woe in the interest of my boys.
While reading this, we also read through the Carnivorous Carnival and the Slippery Slope; the Hardys rarely being the book of the evening.Nevertheless, the mystery takes the usual twists and turns with suspects dropping clues and staging attacks, the boys here under fire in the air, attacked on the sea and finally trapped underground.
Not to mention the kidnapping of their friend’s family and the added on treasure hunt.
But the Hardys' superior intellect and resourcefulness finally triumph.
In this book they are knocked out by gas, nearly die of Carbon Monoxide poisoning, have two motorcycle crashes, are almost crushed by a falling station wagon, help a friend keep his sabotaged boat from sinking, nearly have their boat sabotaged, rescue a girlfriend from drowning who is trapped in a fishing net, are nearly mowed down by a combine, rescue a man from being burned alive in a forest fire, shot at while flying in an airplane, have fake grenade with a warning note tossed through their window, caught by weapons smugglers who tie them up and prepare to kill them with poison gas, and these are just the items I remember off the top of my head.
I've read 5 of these books this year and the formula is pretty much the same in all of them.
The Shore Road Mystery, a Hardy Boys book written by Franklin W.
One really enjoyable part of the book is that the author is able to present a great amount of evidence that the Hardy Boys find as they are sleuthing and trying to find clues to the kidnappings and stolen cars that are occurring throughout the book.
In the beginning, this evidence may not make the solution clear to the reader, but the author is able to put all of the evidence together and present a solution to the mystery that makes sense and makes the reader feel satisfied.
