How can I write this review without sounding like I'm about to start stalking Kelley Armstrong?I loved this book.
I loved all the characters in it.
It was well written, with engaging, interesting characters.
Turning from page to page, absolutely and completely emotionally invested in the characters and feeling like you're right there, experiencing things through their eyes, their fingers and their brains even.This book, to me, equals The Hunger Games and that's VERY high praise.
I think I may actually enjoy it more than the Fever Series - though I don't want to go saying anything I can't take back!
If they're not, I think my heart is going to break!
I was utterly absorbed by this book from the first page, completely mesmerised by the characters playing out on the pages before me.
She is truly a unique voice and I wished that Armstrong had continued the series from Elena's point of view because I'm IN LOVE with her.
Really, even when I wanted to strangle her for stupidity, I loved her.
I could say that about Clay, too (GOD, I loved Clay, even when I hated him).
These are those rare types of characters you never want to let go once you've found them.
I have favorite series, and this is definitely one of them, but most of the time my favorite book in the series is not the first one.
I love Elena.
I love Clay.
I love them together, and I HATE them separated.
I can't think of a single think about this book that I don't like.ALSO Clayton Danvers might be my all-time favorite book boyfriend:1.
He would do anything, A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G to keep Elena safe/rescue her.
I love him more than Curran Lennart <----I didn't even know his last name until I just looked it up.
I love him more than Trent Kalamack.
A lot of authors tend to rely on supernatural abilities to make their fantasy and paranormal characters more appealing to us foolish mortals who seek our escapes amongst their pages.
The abilities Armstrong’s werewolves were granted were surprisingly believable, even without that total suspension of reality that is required to read a book about werewolves or vampires or the Fey. They were stronger than the average human, able to run harder longer, bench press more and do more pushups.
Like so many others who read urban fantasy and paranormal romance, werewolves have not been my favorite characters.
She still yearns to be human, or at least, to fit in in the human world, but the situation is becoming more threatening and her Pack-brothers are losing their lives: and the enemy wants her.While the Prologue was necessary in setting up the main character and narrator, Elena, and it worked well written in present tense - gives it that timeless quality - I found it a bit boring and was worried I wouldn't be able to get through the book.
I first read this book when it came out and loved it.
It was one of the few books I'd read that focused predominantly on werewolves.
I've read MANY since and so I went back and reread this because I was curious if it would hold up against the masses.
Let me just say that out of all paranormal books I've read, Clay has to be one of the sexiest, if not the sexiest male character.
He doesn't have to build a monument to himself and then stand on top of it screaming that he's an alpha like some characters.
His name is Clay and he's a sociopathic werewolf.
He hates humans and kills them without remorse.
But, he is also willing to kill anyone for the woman he loves.
He's so sweet!aww, you are kinda cute with your little noseless face, aren't you?So, this book is about the only female werewolf in existence, Elena.
She's not happy being a furry and left the pack to live a human life.
But, you can't keep a good furry down!Yeah, the human experience may be a little over-rated...Elena gets called back to the pack to help hunt down some rogue werewolves who are killing people.
DNF at 24%.
I guess it's just that, written in 2004, and reading it now, I don't feel I am being exposed to anything I haven't seen before.
If I had only read this about 5 years ago...
There are only a small handful of authors who write UF that I can enjoy.
:/ It sucks.The writing is fine, the story is fine.
It reminds me of Mercy Thompson - Moon Called - which I also DNF'd.
I also don't like Elena that much.
The only character I do like is Clay.He's hot!
Maybe I'll just watch the TV show....Buddy read with the MacHalo group.
A warning to the reader, don't pick this book up if you cannot devote hours to reading it.
Elena is a fascinating protagonist, not all bad, but not all good either.
You wonder how Elena can stay mad at him, although he really did her dirty (you have to read it to find out).
As the only female werewolf, Elena is cherished like a beloved sister and daughter.
If you are looking for an urban fantasy book written like mainstream fiction, or a good fiction book that is very much urban fantasy, or a really incredible werewolf novel, you would probably just love this book.
Blog • Bookstagram • Goodreads • TwitterLinkTree • Club • Club BookstagramI’m going to start off by saying this is my all-time favorite series of books for the adult mind.
He doesn’t know her species and she plans to keep it a secret from him for forever, which isn’t easy.She gets a call from Jeremy, the Pack leader, saying that he needs to talk to her and its urgent.After a few phone calls back, since Philip insist that she calls back someone she claims to be her family (she’s an orphan; which has a back story of its own), she gets annoyed and she flies out to New York to see what is up.There’s a mutt killing on Pack territory.
It is written from the POV of Elena Michaels, a "bitten" werewolf who is trying to live like a normal human, since the circumstances under which she was turned felt like a betrayed and she did not want to have anything to do with the pack.
If we were allowed to live through all those formative events with the character, I think the book would not have felt like a chore a lot of the time, because in the moments of current action and discovery, the narrative shined and the reader could really get engaged.
Elena Michaels is the most idiotic and annoying main character ever.
As if it's not bad enough that she's the stereotypical urban fantasy heroine (hates being "different", continually tries to be "normal", etc.), she's also just plain -stupid-.
The spends the entire book swearing on her life that she doesn't love Clay (ex-fiance, turned her into a werewolf, blah blah blah), and yet is cuddling up with him and spending time with him the whole time, DESPITE the fact that she keeps saying how much she cares about her human boyfriend back home.And then, whenever Clay tries to get serious about her and him getting back together, she completely shuts him out and shouts at him for no reason and doesn'tlisten to a word he says.If the story hadn't revolved around Elena Michaels, the book would've been passable.
But since it did revolve around her, it was awful.Full review: http://persyandarty.blogspot.com/2012...
Out of all of the shifter books I have read this has got be the be the best one I have ever read. I was starting to think that shifters may not be for me, but wow can Kelly Armstrong write. I was a little worried about this series because I wasn’t too fond of her young adult series. But I can definitely say I will be continuing with the Women of the Otherworld series. I am highly addicted to some Elena and Clay.  "You forget, darling.I am the local psychopath.” She stared at him. “Oh my God, it’
A long time ago she fell in love and was engaged to be married to Clay the love of her life, but while meeting with Jeremy the Alpha of the pack Clay is in.
While Elena is back for a while trying to solve this problem for the pack, Clay is making good use of this time trying to win her back.
My favorite part of the book is Elena and Clay and I just have to say I WANT MORE!
I can’t wait to read book two in the series, Stolen and find out what happens next in the Women of the Otherworld Series.
Well, I think it’s very safe to say that I am not a fan of Kelley Armstrong’s writing style.
As a result there’s only a few shining examples of Werewolf fiction done extremely well for me – Maggie Stiefvater, Andrea Cremer, and Sisters Red were also quite good.
That said it’s a good thing I am planning on reading this soon.
Le eyeroll.Besides that Armstrong’s writing style does very little for me.
Her writing does not compel me, does not keep my attention glued to the pages.
I was bored the whole first chunk of the book and, as a result, didn’t even crack my customary 75 page rule.
I have already read the author's third and fourth books, Dime Store Magic and Industrial Magic and I have to say I wish I'd started here, at the beginning.
I'd say this series would be OK for a 14 or 15 year old, since they see much worse than this on TV, but parents please use your own discretion with your own kids!I think what I like best about this book is that Armstrong's take on werewolves is pretty sensible.
I'm in the mood to open another bag of chips and start right in on Stolen, the next book in the series.
Apart from the fact that only Jericho Barrons could have rescued Bitten from a pool of mindboggling dullness, Armstrong's werewolves just didn't match my expectations *sulkily stripes away raw animalism, carnality, pack troubles, alpha fights, angst, werewolvish sex - whatever that may be..*. I actually caught myself longing for the werewolves in Blood & Chocolate, trailer trashy and imperfect as they were. Wouldn't surprise me if the pack in Bitten grows organic tomatoes for a living too.I'm probably just bitter though, everyone else on Goodreads seems to be bitten and smitten.

1/8/2014 UPDATEI finished this freakin book!
YES, I read it all on my third attempt!
I feel f*cking proud right now!The most weird thing is that I didn't hate it.
You would think that since I'd already tried the book 2 times and couldn't finish it either of them I would hate it.
I have a thing for crappy TV-shows, don't judge.I don't think I'll be reading the second any time soon but just the fact that I finished this makes me really happy!
What lured me in here was Armstrong's prose, which is often sensual and exciting, at least in the prologue, where Elena wakes at 2 a.m., sneaks out of the Toronto apartment she shares with her new boyfriend, transforms into a 130-pound wolf and goes for a run in a ravine.My legs pick up the rhythm before I'm halfway down the ravine.
Armstrong doesn't show any ingenuity when it comes to her narrative either, which involves Elena departing Toronto to assist her Pack, a group of six or seven men who exist in the human world, but are unable to deal with one rogue werewolf who's intruded on their territory in upstate New York.
Yes, it follows the story of a werewolf named Elena and the trials and tribulations of her pack.
But what is so exceptional about this book is the complex emotions invoked by our main character.Elena never wanted to be werewolf.
And as the story progresses and the rogue-wolf plot becomes more dangerous and deadly, we see Elena fighting the pack, Clay, and herself and she tries to figure out where she truly fits in.Armstrong makes it easy to see both sides of Elena's warring emotions.
The hurt and resentment for Clay is understandable in the context of her horrific life.
Un grande blob informe senza arte né parte, dove il lettore scaltrissimo - pane e volpe a pranzo e cena, mica baubaumiciomicio - può prevedere l'esito della storia e delle dinamiche già dalla trama, cosicchè può prendere, andare a pesca e seguire comunque la storia senza traumi.Il primo grande problema, che a questo punto sembra essere il marchio di fabbrica del genere, è una protagonista nell'ordine: deficiente, cretina, rincoglionita, squallida e così antipatica che i pollici ti prudono da morire; personalmente avrei voluto prendere qualsiasi cosa presente nella mia stanza e tirargliela addosso, cercando di colpirla.
In fact, I think I am; starting any book with "I'm going to hate this" doesn't really help push away the negative thought from your mind even when you're half-way into it and it actually is not that bad.
I went a bit overboard with my contempt up there, and Bitten, while not completely off the contemporary romance Venn Diagram, wasn't as bad as some of the others, with the paranormal mixed in it.
It felt like Elena Michaels was getting abnormally comfortable in a house full of complete strangers and this was downright weird.Clayton, the supposedly alpha male douche bag of this book and the undeniable love interest of Elena Michaels, was a mess.
We are introduced into a new werewolf world with this series, one that has not been described in any other series I have read so far.
First she is alone with this guy (Jaime) who keeps telling her she has been bitten by Clay (the teacher) and that she is now a werewolf.
She just knows she has to escape From this Jaime who keeps telling her that to stay with him and the pack is the best thing she can do so far.
I loved to see Elena struggle to understand everything in this new world and Clay trying to make Elena understand this was the right thing for her.
Very conflicting feeling here.Here are some of my thoughts:• I’m just gonna outright say it. I don’t like the protagonist, which is such a disappointment because my friend recommended me this book for the exact reason that it has a strong protagonist. LOL. I just find her so frustrating. Yes, I totally feel for her for her past – it is damn sad and terrifying. I think the narrative may have been not worked for me in this case because it comes off more detached than emotional (view spoiler)[espec
I don’t like the protagonist, which is such a disappointment because my friend recommended me this book for the exact reason that it has a strong protagonist.
I think the narrative may have been not worked for me in this case because it comes off more detached than emotional (view spoiler)[especially in regards to sensitive topics, such as sexual abuse (hide spoiler)].
The plot/world-building is somewhat interesting, but debatable.Things that you might want to know (WARNING: Spoilers below)Happy/satisfying ending?
(view spoiler)[Happy, but not the last book.
(view spoiler)[Sad stuff.
Did not cry (perhaps because of the detached narration that I personally perceived) (hide spoiler)]Humor?
(hide spoiler)]---------My friend recommended this to me.
Mad and unable to forgive, she tries to escape her pack to find her place in the human world.
When she finally thinks she is settled in her human ("normal") life, the pack calls for her help and she can't say "no." When she is back, she faces her past and at last realizes what she really wants and needs.I am a huge fan of currently popular urban fantasy genre and I believe "Bitten" is one of the better books in this genre.
It starts a little slow, but picks up tremendously in latter part of the book when werewolf world is unraveled.
The only two characters I liked here were Clay and Jeremy, so if I will continue with the series it will be purely for them.Otherwise, the plot was predictable.
The sort of love triangle there just for the occasional drama (view spoiler)[cheating is never ok in my book, even if the MC loved Clay, she still cheated on her current partner multiple times with him and that didn't exactly endear her to me (hide spoiler)].
I love UF books, but I have never encountered an adult PNR series I loved yet.
But I did like Bitten more than the confusion of a first book of her other adult UF, Omens.
4 tiny stars but still 4.
So I'm rounding up although I'm quite conflicted about it.
Let's face it guys.
This was first published in 2001.
How many similar books are published since?!
I'll tell you - quite many!
Still the story is very interesting and the book keeps its ground.
If you're looking for a very good UF read with strong focus on werewolves, that's your book.
I'm just not very fond of her life choices throughout almost the entire book.
Everything else was very good.More of my thoughts to come when I am in the mood.
The villains aren’t that big of a threat, except maybe for (view spoiler)[one murderer dude, but he’s not comfortable with his werewolf abilities, so it’s made clear he’s at a disadvantage.
(hide spoiler)] In fact, the pack seems just as ruthless as the bad guys.
Elena calls the mutts "Werewolf Mafia,' but actually, the pack is the mafia.
There’s also very little sexual tension and conflict between Clay and Elena.
Like for instance, how does Elena know there are only about 35 werewolves in the world?
(view spoiler)[I still don’t know why he bit Elena.
A thrilling and tight plot, fast paced paranormal romance filled with action, mystery in a world inhabited by werewolves, demons, half-demons, ghosts, witches and lots of other supernaturals and humans too of course, that is both convincing and believable.Strong and memorable characters, my favorites being Elena & Clay (the one who BITES her!!!!).Elena is not the delicate and swooning heroine and though it took me a while to warm to her, she does in the end show that she’s more than just a sexy and pretty woman.Clay – wow this is some hardass guy…werewolf.
This werewolf is beyond alpha-male – super macho.Great character development and such an interesting world building.
