They and some of the characters we already know end up on journeys, going to strange places and meeting strange creatures, with puns galore.
He has arguably been around since the very first Oz book, in which a tiger is mentioned, but he has officially been around since the third one, but always as a minor character who pulls Ozma's chariot and complains about how hungry he is and how he can't eat babies because his conscience won't let him.
This book came out a few years before the start of the Great Depression, and the chapter on Down Town mocks the obsession with just making money.
Not quite as good as Baum's books....but I do have a copy of my own, read many times.
Nowhere close to the charm, magic, and inventiveness of the originals. These books should not be considered Oz canon.
