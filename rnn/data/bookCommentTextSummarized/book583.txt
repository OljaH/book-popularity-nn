Imagine, there'd have been no The Playboy Sheikh's Virgin Stable-Girl if not for Edith Maude Hull's 1918 bodice ripper, which turned sheiks into literary catnip forever, for all time, and - I'm pretty confident - into infinity and beyond.This is the original "virgin ravished by sheik" romance, with all the required alpha male swagger and conceit, as well as the shamed heroine's vows of eternal hatred eventually blossoming into consuming love.
(hide spoiler)] One of our readers mentioned The Sheik in connection with this discussion, and curiosity + free on Gutenberg sucked me in.<-----I'm kind of bad that way.This book was pretty much our grandmothers' and great-grandmothers' Fifty Shades of Grey.
Oh, also: pretty much every guy who sees Diana wants her bad, including the sheik's bestie, a French nobleman, which causes issues later on.I really can't recommend it but it was interesting reading, in a kind of salacious way, and from a historical point of view.
1  Melodramatic and Very Disturbing StarsI don't know where to start with this very disturbing, highly repetitive, and very melodramatic book. Oh, the melodrama! A previous reviewer stated that she kept thinking of a silent movie while reading the reactions and internal dialogue of the heroine. I couldn't agree more! All I kept seeing in my mind's eye was this picture.  The Sheik, written in 1919, both horrified and intrigued me at the same time. I truly HATED the storyline—the racism, animal cr

I couldn't agree more!
All I kept seeing in my mind's eye was this picture.
Nonetheless, I couldn't seem to pull myself away from it either.
Still, I read the book from start to finish and I have no doubt that I will be thinking about it for some time to come.
Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest💙 I read this for the Unapologetic Romance Readers' New Years 2018 Reading Challenge, for the category of: Classic (Literature) Romance. For more info on this challenge, click here. 💙In my review of THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER, I said that Woodiwiss is often credited with writing the first bodice ripper. While she was certainly one of the first mainstream authors to publish a widely read romance with an open bedroom door *wink*, THE SHEIK has
He's half Spanish, half English, and was adopted by a sheik who fell in love with his mother, and out of love for her, bequeathed to him his name and title.One of the "conflicts" of the book is Ahmed's blistering hatred of English people, and his refusal to speak in anything but French or Arabic.
It isn't available for Kindle in English, but I did find a Spanish version, so if I ever feel like I want to work for my masochism, I'll buy that and let loose.Interestingly, the plot of this story is very similar to Johanna Lindsey's CAPTIVE BRIDE, from the escape attempts, to the rival sheik, to the fact that the sheik is half-white.
In choosing to buy books like The Sheik, through which they could treat themselves to an erotic and emotional fantasy, women readers became active participants in a woman-made market of desire.I think these ideas can be useful, but I don't think that they are adequate to explain The Sheik.I think The Sheik is about survival.Diana is trapped by the Sheik.
A man who takes what he wants with no thought to anything but what he wants and needs.He kidnaps her and forces her into submission..night after night.Ahmed is a totally arrogant "alpha-male" with a very complex personality and Diana tries to resist and defy him at all times but finds she cannot..and eventually falls for her dark and handsome captor.
So..was there any "eye-rolling" "head-shaking" on my part?Well yes, there was one for me: Diana finally makes her escape after waiting so long for the right moment..and after riding so long she must stop at the next Osis to rest herself and the horse.
EDITED: 7/20/13I decided that this book deserves a 5 star after never leaving my mind since I read it in 2011.Whew, Ahmed Monseigneur!
I have never feared a couple not ending up together as I did with Diane and Ahmed!
When Diane loves or hate it is with such a passion that defies all reasoning.
My agony was unwarranted as she fell in love with him with such compelling passion that u are blown away by its intensity!
The transition from hate to love was non existent.
I read the chapter twice just to feel the passion again.
Diana Mayo is an insult to women everywhere.
Honestly, if it were me, I would have killed him as soon as he gave her that gun and said he trusted her.How can a woman, in her right mind, see the bruises on her arm and think: "It's not his fault, he doesn't know his own strength.
If he killed me I'd still love him." How entirely disgusting.
Where?Still, I have to admit the book was a page turner, and even shocked and disgusted by their character and actions, I really was curious to know how Ahmed and Diana's "love" story would end.
4/17 Guilty Pleasures moduleIf you think 'Beauty and the Beast' has Stockholm Syndrome, this takes it to a whole new level.
I still have my grandmother's copy, a 1921 American first printing which is now falling to pieces.
I also own a 1963 mass market paperback version [on the cover: "he's pop, op, and camp" with photos from the film]; and a 2001 trade paperback reprint ed with a still from the movie on the cover (pub by Pine Street Books of the Univ.
[I don't do online purchasing for these books as it's too easy- I like to rely on serendipity to find copies:]As to the story itself- it does not really pass muster for modern sensibilities.
I encourage you to download and read this Classic for FREE from Amazon or Guttenberg.Given the time of publication in 1919, almost 100 years ago during the shocking destruction and loss of life of The Great War (WWI)and the renewed interest in the Arab World due to the British fighting the Ottoman Empire there in Arab lands, and in the context of the repressed Victorian times of the novel's setting, The Sheik was an extraordinary book.
She is taken back to their main camp, where she learns two things: 1) She's just been kidnapped by the sheik--the ruler of the men in his camp--and he wants her, consent or no.2) Her rapist is kinda hot (you see where this is going?)So the Sheik pretty much rapes Diana every night for a whole month.
So the moral of the story is essentially this: rape=love and is therefore okay.
But later on in the book, Diana is about to be raped by ANOTHER sheik, but this one is all fat and gross and ew.
Hull imprints a good depth of character in the leads, which more people might appreciate if they could stop sniveling over the 1920s-inherent content like rape, colonialism, etc.
This wasn't a politically correct era, yet Hull dared to have a white girl fall in love with a Sheik, & vice versa.
Accordingly, negative traits on both sides define the MCs' initial prejudice, which is why they need to grow & change.
The line isn't clearly defined, nor should it be -- that's what makes a gripping story.
;) So to anyone who shares a love of 70s-style romance novels: if you haven't read this yet, give it a try.
Part of the writing style is probably due to the time period, the book originally being published in the 1920s (1919 to be precise), but I will always argue that authorial laziness is partly to blame when ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’.
It’s hard to root for the couple to end up together, she is, after all, being raped repeatedly, and she is giving up her whole life to continue living in the desert with her abuser, but the sudden ending is mildly satisfying.
Just picked up a hardcover copy at the UBS. Publishers A.L. Burt Company, inscription inside "To Albert. Xmas 1923."
When I stated my love affair with reading, Barbara Cartland was the BOMB!!
As a 12 year old young girl, I couldn't get enough of her books.So when I read a story about The Sheik being the Book that scandalized the world in the 1920's when it was released ( was even BANNED in certain areas).
I so had to take a trip down memory land and read itNow, 36 years later, I can honestly say that I'm still in love with Barbara Cartland.
The Sheik was a wonderful, sweet and exciting story.
I can't honestly say this is the best book I have ever read or anything.
Yet at the same time I just don't know how I could possibly rate this any less that 5 stars!
It has everything you could possibly want from a cheesy romance novel!
Heroine raised as a boy and unaware of her womanly charms, kidnapping, rape (off page of course!
this was written in 1918), brutal hero, attempted escape, another kidnapping, an attempted rape, murder, murder, attempted murder, hero near death, attempted suicide and the best part the HEA!!!
I loved it and might even keep it around for a re-read!
What a horrible piece of tripe. Good Lord. This was simply the most painfully bad book I have ever read. True love equals rape, physical and emotional abuse and codependent martyrdom of the most depraved sort. And of course the whole time the "sheik" is secretly white because no white woman could be attracted to a real Middle Eastern. I feel ill.
4/17 Guilty Pleasure module. I was genuinely disgusted reading this book, and if I didn't have to read it for university you can guarantee I would never have touched it in a million years. Just so problematic. So problematic.
(Yes, unfortunately, I'm 99.999% sure that the author played "The Taming of the Shrew" straight and saw nothing wrong with it.) I'm not sure what made this book easier to go through than more modern entries.
Maybe it's just my brain refusing to believe a woman would write this, grasping at the straws that spawned the first paragraph of this review.If you can stomach the idea, read it ironically.
En parte por la forma que esta escrito, es de hace +/- 90 años y las autoras en aquellos tiempos eran más descriptivas en sus novelas en lugar de las páginas llenas de diálogos que estamos acostumbradas hoy en día y otro por la actitud arrogante y elevada de la prota Diana Mayo y la actitud cavernícola de Ahmed, ambos complicados personajes desde que salen a escena.El Árabe es uno de esos libros denominados bodice ripper o también llamados 'seducción forzada' y aunque sucede a puertas cerradas, la verdad es que creo que nunca le daré 5 estrellas a libros así.
Even though I grew up loving this book, I have to only give it two stars for it's long and boring sections.
For some reason, women are drawn to this story and it was a huge hit back in the 1920's when it first came out.
My sisters and I were all in love with the actor, the film, and this book when we all first discovered it for ourselves in the mid-90's.
Cheezy, I know, but it appeals to women somehow.
it's kind of a pre-requisite romance novel I'm afraid.
(I do NOT read 'romance novels' if you know what I mean).
It's rumor to be the godfather of bodice rippers, the book women whispered about in the days it was published and finally I got my grubby little hands on it!
Ok it was the ebook version but hey I got it and that's what counts.Coming into the book I knew it was rumored to have horrible violence , rape and of course a simmer hatred that turns to love.
It must have shocked the public back in the day it was published but after reading more modern bodice rippers say from the early 90's you probably won't be as shocked, I wasn't.
This is a remarkably offensive book by modern standards.
Racism, sexism, you name it.
I think, ironically, the most offensive part is the revelation at the end that...is somehow supposed to make everything that has happened more palatable?
Just the fact that Hull thought it would is obscenely offensive....That said, there's a reason this is a classic.
It's got remarkably good writing, lots of adventure, and a story and passion romance novelists have been trying -- and failing -- to emulate ever since.2 stars for the book, +1 because despite everything, you can tell why this became the sensation that it did.
The sheik kidnaps her and rapes her repeatedly over a period of little more than a month; treats her like crap, forces her to obey him, is cruel to animals and rotten to everyone around him and this woman FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM AND CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HIM?
This novel was a terrible book.
Rape is a violent, degrading act and this man's actions should never have been forgiven.
He should have been killed off and she was the stupidest woman ever.
A horrific book.
Plus, it is NOT a love story.
A man who loves a woman would not rape her.
What starts off as a seemingly feminist tale of morals, quickly descends into pulpy, semi-romantic fantasies of submission and exoticism. Diane Mayo is quite uninteresting as a main character, and her romantic liaison with an Arab sheik who kidnapped and raped her never quite comes across as plausible or even interesting.This used to be a Fifty Shades of Grey-kind of thing in the twenties. Now it's just racist and anti-feminist. Sad story.
I huge hit with women during the 1920's, I read (now own) my grandma's copy of this (to be honest) boring book. I guess I'm jaded in my romance novel experiences (I devoured them in the 70's as an impressionable teen), but what once must have been risque and titillating in the 20's is really very quaint today. I give it 3 stars in honor of my grandma, and because it is a classic of it's genre.
This book sounds like Adora’s mildly racist cousin. Also what can you expect from a book whose main character shares last name with a condiment? Not much.
(Of course not, no English girl of that era could possibly be in love with a dark-skinned barbarian!) The sheik is really an English lord, raised in the desert by Arabs and tanned by the sun.
Though he did not love her, he wanted her still; she had read that in his eyes five minutes ago, and she was happy even for that."The silent movie, and its sequel, Son of the Sheik, were wildly popular, yet many fathers and husbands forbade their daughters and wives from seeing it.
I suppose most novels with "Sheik" in the title feature most of these things, but E.M. Hull pulls them all together into one great old melodrama.While you read this book, search youtube for the great Nelson Eddy singing "Kashmiri Song" ("Pale Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar".) Also found under the title "Indian Love Lyrics".
The song is mentioned several times in the book, and a good vintage recording of this lovely song will set the mood.
There are many nice vintage recordings of this very popular old song but Nelson Eddy is a baritone (like The Sheik of the novel ;-).
