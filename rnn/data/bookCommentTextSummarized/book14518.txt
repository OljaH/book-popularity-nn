Very long, very detailed, and after a while, very repetitive.
If you stop after just a few of his books you'd probably give them 4 or 5 stars, but beyond that they start to grate.
I mean, Clancy spends hundreds of pages getting his details just right, the settings perfect etc., then he has Ryan dodging more bullets than James Bond!
I finally threw my hands up and surrendered when Ryan becomes President.
I can't remember what piece of crap that was in.I've given three stars as a compromise between my reactions when reading my first Clancy (brilliant) and last Clancy (doorstop).
The thing that makes this book truly bad is the lack of development of any of the characters, particularly Jack Ryan.
Everything he is challenged with in this story is external, and though clearly dangerous, it is only superficially so.One particularly bad section of the novel centers on Jack's plane flight home from England.
Jack Ryan is the very image of self-satisfied rich white American culture from the mid-1980s, and while that itself does not necessarily make him a bad character, the superficial way in which it is handled does.I will sum-up by saying that this book essentially reads like a bad British Monarchy fanfiction with an incredibly transparent main character.
5 star🇺🇸🌺
Executive Summary: After enjoying The Hunt for Red October, I had high hopes for this book, and found myself a bit disappointed.Audio book: I've listened to one or two books read by Scott Brick.
I've seen every Jack Ryan movie they've made (and enjoyed most of them), including this one, but this is only my 3rd book in the series I've read.
After a pretty exciting start the next quarter or so seemed to just drag on.See Jack Ryan, budding Analyst and he recovers in a hospital!
However if the goal was to mix in reality with fiction to tell an exciting spy thriller, this book fell short for me.
A 'prequel' to The Hunt for Red October that came a few years before, this takes us back and makes the common mistake of presenting a younger version of a protagonist that really does not seem consistent with the one we met in a later story.
As if that wasn't enough, the real-life prince of Wales figures and that whole storyline sinks the entire story.
To top it off, Clancy seems to have struggled with his obviously pre-defined volume this time around; very long parts of this book could easily have been cut and nothing would have been lost.
Dude books.
I call them "palette cleansers" because sometimes I just get tired of reading about FEELINGS and EMOTIONS and THOUGHTS.
This book didn't have any of those other things.
It had intrigue, machismo, swearing, guns, and violence.
Pretty much pg-13 level, nothing too too much.But it also had bravery, mystery, and for reals: the main guy likes his wife and kid.
And he doesn't cheat on her.
Two thumbs up.So, in all, a bit more insight than the movie version, but pretty much the gist of it.
And now my palette has been cleansed.
On to girl books once more.
Review to follow
3.5 to 4.0 stars. Third Jack Ryan book published but first in terms of internal chronology as the events take place before those in The Hunt for Red October. While I enjoyed some of the later Ryan novels more (especially those in which John Clark and his crew played a major part), this is still a quality thriller and certainly worth a read. A pretty good Clancy novel is still much better than a lot of the junk that is out there.
I heard that Tom Clancy hated the movie this book inspired.
This is another one of Tom Clancy's political statements disguised as a novel, with the IRA representing communism.
I suppose though my biggest problem is with Clancy's notion that Ryan is somehow able or even capable of doing half of what he undergos, just because he's a former marine with a career of 3 months and who'd never seen combat.
In reality, Ryan would have been struck dumb by it all like everyone else, and even if he hadn't, if he had gone head to head with an IRA gunman, they would have eaten him for breakfast.
Although an old novel, but this is a classic novel about Jack Ryan, a former US marines who was on a work/vacation to the UK.
A day after his arrival, he finds himself in a gun battle with 3 terrorists attacking the prince of Wales, his wife and few months old baby.
They survived the attack, thanks to Jack who sustains an injury but got the Knighthood for his bravery.After that comes trouble from...
go read it yourself to find out what happened in the end.I really like the plot.
It's a classic like from a master plotter (mario Puzo).Have fun reading.
Irish bashing aside, a solid thriller. Can't deny I had a good time with the sun, not in the sun. Too much fun. Not that you need to know any of that. Details are all mine.
After losing my Dad recently, I watched the entire Jack Ryan series on Amazon all the way through over about 36 hours.
(FYI, the show is not based on any particular book according to the show creators, so I don't feel like I spoiled anything by watching first.)I love Jack Ryan.
(I hope it stays like that throughout the series.) Jack Ryan is an ex-marine who ends up working for the CIA in a very roundabout way.
It seemed like Tom Clancy really disliked the bad guys.
There's a great opener where Jack Ryan is almost hit by a bus and barely exhales before he is swept into a kidnapping attempt on the British royal family.
But it's all downhill from there as we feel the boredom of waiting around to be discharged from the hospital, interrupted by multiple, totally gratuitous visits from members of the royal family who express their deep admiration of Ryan, but in awkwardly bantering ways.
Once he gets out of the hospital, we're taken on a tourist visit to the Tower of London which feels like a transcript of the actual tour, except for more awkward bantering at the end about how special Jack is.
I still can't understand how, after 787 pages, Tom Clancy was unable to develop even the slightest hint of personality in any of the 30+ characters in this novel.
I'm sure Clancy did plenty of research on the military, procedures, guns, planes, ships, ranks, etc.
Add to that the god-awful dialogue, the cringeworthy awkwardness of the 'sex' scenes, and the breathtakingly and unforgivably stupid yelling-at-the-crown-prince (who later wields an Uzi in a boat chase) scene, and it's probably one of the most painful 800 pages I've ever read.
So awful.
I have a theory that this is actually the first novel that Tom Clancy wrote, simply because it seems to me to be a wish-fulfillment fantasy. "Wouldn't it be great if I saved the royal family of England and was knighted by the queen." Great daydream and he turned it into a novel.Anyway, I liked it anyway. Good page-turner. It is probably a 4.5 stars read, but I rounded up.
כשנודע לי אחר כך שהוא היה סוכן(באותו זמן חשבתי שCIA, אבל הוא היה סוכן ביטוח כמדומני) והוציא הרבה ספרים נחשבים בז'אנר.
משם שבוע הספר ועוד ביקור בסיפור חוזר וגמרתי עם עשרה ספרים שלו.לצערי, תקופת הבחינות שהייתה בפתח מנעה ממני להתענג על הסדרה וכשאני לא קורא משהו שאני די רוצה, ציפיות מתפתחות, במיוחד כשזה הוא סופר שלא קראתי ויש לי עשרה ספרים(קצת אימפולסיבי והימור בראייה לאחור).
אולי זה בגלל שהספרים שלפני זה קראתי היו על גבריאל אלון ועל ג'ק ריצ'ר שהם יותר הגיבורים הטיפוסיים בז'אנר הפעולה אז הניגוד היה טיפה "בוהק" יותר.בכללי, כל הספר מרגיש שהוא יכול היה לקרות באמת בשנות השמונים.
This story is about Ryan's actions in England when, as an innocent bystander, tries to stop a terrorist (IRA-like group) action and what happens as a result in England and then back home in Annapolis.
Clancy does have a knack for keeping the pedal to the metal when he's in the middle of action sequences.Scott Brick narrated the audiobook, which made it feel a bit like a science fiction story at first (he has done a lot of them), but I got over that quickly.
I like his narration, though he pronounces "Annapolis" funny.
I read this after watching The Hunt for Red October and reading that book, too.Jack Ryan is a CIA analyst who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and unexpectedly thwarts a kidnapping attempt of the British Royal family while on seminar in England.
He becomes a hero to the British people and an enemy of the IRA (Irish Republican Army), who put out a death warrant on him.Ryan returns to America, but the IRA send their thugs to 'take him out,' and accidentally target his family in the process.
This book started and ended with a bang but lost me in the middle.
After the quick start with lots of action, the next 150 to 200 pages felt like filler pages.
A lot of them could have been taken out or condensed down and the book would have been better.
The last part of the book really picked up though and made for a good ending.If you are looking for a deep intellectualy book then Patriot Games probably isn't for you.
Ryan Jack isn't a super deep character but he is a pretty smart one who wonders a lot about why things are the way they are.
It really deserves more like 4.5 stars. I’d forgotten how good Clancy was at pacing and building a plot. His books are pure pretty caesura land can bog down in the details here and there, but in general they’re excellent and pull the reader along in a compelling way. Really enjoyable.
I may be rating this a bit low because compared to the movie and screen play it was a bit dull.Recommend only to those who are going to read "the jack Ryan Universe"; it explains how he got into the CIA.
Bei Clancys Kapiteln mit Jack Ryan als Liebling der königlichen Familie fühlt man sich hundert Jahre zurück versetzt, aber ohne diesen ganzen monarchischen Mumpitz und die Männerfreundschaft zwischen JR und PC, funktioniert das Finale nun mal nicht, wie sonst sollte der Prince of Wales sich zu einem Privatbesuch bei Jack Ryan verpflichtet fühlen, der den Terroristen viel bessere Zugriffsmöglichkeiten als beim vom amerikanischen Touristen vereitelten Angriff auf den königlichen Rolls-Royce bietet?Zwei königliche Familien im KreuzfeuerZwischen diesen beiden Extremsituationen, bei denen sich der spätere Serienheld als Mann bewähren darf, beschreibt TC Ryans Weg vom Skeptiker, der die Agency ab und an für seine Zwecke nutzt, zum Überzeugungstäter, der beim Auslangsgeheimdienst insgeheim schon als Kronprinz gilt.
Tom Clancy’s Patriot Games4.5 stars Tom Clancy is known around the world for his fast paced action books. (Several of his books have been made into movies, and one has even been made into a video game series!) This is one of his earlier books, and I anticipated a book just like those who have made him famous with his writing style, such as Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, and others. I wasn’t disappointed. This book, Patriot Games, is a great book, as most of his others were. The Theme of
Tom Clancy’s Patriot Games4.5 stars	Tom Clancy is known around the world for his fast paced action books.
While in the hospital, Jack gave a pep talk to the Prince of Wales, who was the one person he saved from assassination and later becomes a friend in the story, which proves the main character is nice but tough.
It was similar to the Tom Clancy games, which was based off of books like these.
Also, you need to have a basic idea for what guns are and types of them to find out what Tom Clancy is talking about in his book.
I’m pretty sure I’m going to leave Tom Clancy alone for now or at least until I’ve read all of Vince Flynn’s books.
I think Tom Clancy likes to waffle; perhaps he’s paid extra for going over a certain word count.
I jest, he is very detailed in his descriptions and it seems like he’s put a lot of time in for his research.
I read Rainbow 6 a couple of years ago and remember enjoying that quite a lot, that book was longer than this too, but the last two Clancy novels I have read (Hunt for Red October and this) have soured my appetite for any more.If you like this try: “Transfer of Power” by Vince Flynn
It's been years since I'd read this book. I think it was my favorite after The Hunt for Red October, but that may be just because it's been so long since I've read any Tom Clancy. I want to work my way back through the all again. It's been so long, but it's almost like reading them the first time. This one was written long enough ago (1992) that the Irish "Troubles" were still a daily event in the news. Seems like such a better time back then before global terrorism was the norm as it is today.
Sooo gud.... baik film & bukunya, bro/sis... Alurnya enak sekali diikuti, khas dengan detailnya yg paten ala Tom Clancy... Pokoknya oche gtu lhooo... Oh ya, di squel ini, jack ryan mulai diperankan oleh Harrison Ford... and this is the 2nd Tom Clancy's book that i had read.....
The plot itself can be distilled into a decently concise set of events, yet Clancy somehow manages to spread out the prose's volume to the scale of Moby Dick's word count.The themes of military ethics, and searching for humanity in the hearts of criminals made an appearance, and there was a nice sense of coming full circle in contrasting Jack's encounter with Sean Miller in the final showdown with their earlier encounter in the courtroom.
The fact that Jack could finally relate to Miller was an important item of character development, and Clancy pulled it off well.Although I liked the character of Jack, I found him hard to relate to.
Tom Clancy's novel, Patriot Games, is the second book in the critically acclaimed Jack Ryan series.
Now, Ryan must deal with terrorists not only attacking him but also attacking his family.As stated earlier, the novel can be very boring at times.
This scene occurs every day that he is in the hospital, and can make the book repetitive.
Despite having scenes that are repetitive and boring, the novel rebounds many times and is able to keep the reader hooked and engaged.
Overall, the novel strikes a point where it attempts to but doesn't have enough variety to make a lasting impression on the reader.
While on a family vacation Jack Ryan (main character) has an attempted terrorist attack happen right in front of his eyes, with his family.
The book was very well written showing the 2 different sides of the “battle” throughout the story.
The book is written in the late 80’s so you can see the technological difference from then till now.
My favorite part of the story is toward the beginning when Jack thinks to himself that it would be nice to be knighted and the Queen of England actually knighted him.
Another great Clancy book.
Jack is in the wrong place at the worng time and saves the Prince of Wales and his family from being kidnapped.
The book is about people seeking revenge on Jack for interfering in the kidnapping attempt.
The book transpires over land and sea and multiple countries as Clancy books are wont to do.The good bits: lots of tension and suspense.
All the while cursing and praising Mr Clancy for writing such compelling scenes.
The bad bits: Cathy.
I really didn't like her character in this book.
If you love Clancy then this is a must!
