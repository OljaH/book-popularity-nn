Whilst this book impressed me greatly, as did the first of the series, I found that there were still those little things that majorly irked me, even amid the fast-paced sci-fi and action told in a gripping and imaginative way; it was these little things that again prevented me from awarding the novel the 5 stars it would have otherwise deserved.So what's the problem?I can sum it up in two points:1) Sam is a lame protagonist.2) All the girls are 'cute'.Let me explain.Pointer number one: Sam is o
Whilst this book impressed me greatly, as did the first of the series, I found that there were still those little things that majorly irked me, even amid the fast-paced sci-fi and action told in a gripping and imaginative way; it was these little things that again prevented me from awarding the novel the 5 stars it would have otherwise deserved.So what's the problem?I can sum it up in two points:1) Sam is a lame protagonist.2) All the girls are 'cute'.Let me explain.Pointer number one: Sam is one of those over the top do-gooders that just don't exist in real life, let alone at fifteen.
The Gone series is the type of series that has you marking down your calendars waiting for the next installment. Both Hunger, and its predecessor, Gone were gripping and fantastic. Hunger, while darker than Gone, really dove into deeper topics. The cast of the series is diverse in its variety, and you are free to pick your favorites. The dialogue, while nothing fantastic, is realistic and easy. Same as the writing. Yes, the writing has some grammatical mistakes and is far from lyrical, but it serves its purpose. Great book that I recommend to all.
This was a YA dystopian story which followed on from Gone.I felt sorry for Sam in this story, he had so much responsibility and little reward, and the fact that the other kids ignored him instead of helping him must have been frustrating.The storyline in this was mainly about the kids all going hungry as the food ran out, and Sam trying to do something about it.
We had killer mutant worms in the fields, Caine trying to take over the power plant, and this weird entity called ‘the darkness’ playing a role too.
This was an interesting story, but the pace was a bit slow in places.
Now that I've had time to sleep, given my contacts a chance to thoroughly soak and really given myself a chance to absorb that which I gobbled down last night, I must say that I am completely happy with the fact that I didn't wait until the paperback version came out.
Of course I have no idea if it is going to be alright, but I wanted to give him some sort of assurance that he is not a failure and he's doing the best that he can and that's a very good thing.There was another scene that got to be.

HUNGER is an amazing story because of the realistic characters, the spectacular details put into the setting, and the way it shows the theme of accepting hard responsibilities..
He is overwhelmed with responsibilities like finding a way to feed every kid with food supply decreasing, and protecting people from the upcoming gangs.
The setting is described in a way that makes the reader feel like the action can be happening in their own city or town.
He has to prevent arising gang violence, avoid being killed by his twin brother, This amazingly written novel is praised for its life like characters, the extremely detailed setting, and the theme of accepting difficult responsibilities.
So I basically just used an entire Sunday to read the book.
well, it's about a lot of things, but basically it all started in "Gone", the first book in the series, when all the people over the age of fourteen dissapeared.
There is just so much going on in this novel, I can't wrap my mind around it.
And the darkness is hungry.If you have to read one book during the entire summer, read "Gone".
Then, right after you're done with Gone, read "Hunger".
well whatever, just read the series!
for the next book in the series!
i'm tired of this series already and will probably quit. this book was almost 600 pages when it should have been much shorter. there are paragraphs of repetitious nonsense. worse still, this novel lacks a balance of good and evil, justice and mercy, right and wrong. mostly, bad things happen - over and over again - without much good happening. and when something positive happens, it does not balance out the previous 560 pages of negativity. it is exhausting to read, but not in a "literary" good way.
Things aren’t getting any easier in the FAYZ (Fall-out Alley Youth Zone) since the big Thanksgiving Battle against Caine and the other Coates Academy kids.
The kids in Perdido Beach and Coates Academy are left eating what canned food is left.
No one is in good spirits and when Caine recovers from his encounter with The Darkness and makes another move for power, things only get worse.Sam is suffering from all the stress, Little Pete’s powers are getting scarier every day, some of the kids that haven’t developed powers are beginning to start trouble, and important people are switching sides.
Jesus, I was always thinking oh please don't die!!This mutant bugs are just ewwwww!The ending was crushing I was like no no no Lana you have to save them!(view spoiler)[And Lana!
When Dekka asked for her help, I was like Lana is going to help her...but NO, she ran way to the gaiaphage...this thing is gross..and I still don't know what it is exactly.
(hide spoiler)]Zil and his crew...ooh I would kill them with my bare hands!
(view spoiler)[SOMEONE HAS TO SAVE HER!
When they went to bury her I was like she's not dead!
(hide spoiler)]I hope Duck's alive!
Though not as good as GONE: too many different plots and points of view made this book kind of hectic.Michael Grant is definitely an author with a knack for action-driven stories heavy on suspense and excitement.
I *do* like the large ensemble cast of characters, BUT in this story, I think there were a little too many perspectives, too many characters to keep track of, and I think that sometimes scenes that really should have gone to the "main characters" (like Sam and Astrid) were spent on all these secondary characters.
-- 2017 --Ook bij het herlezen bleef Hunger spannend.
Ik houd van de manier waarop Michael Grant een wereld vol diverse en realistische personages weet neer te zetten.
Ook de manier waarop nieuwe personages zoals Orsay en Duck aan het verhaal worden toegevoegd voelt heel natuurlijk.
Even with all the strange paranormal powers, I feel like this book is realistic; I imagine a world like grown ups would be like this.
All the fighting, the hungry kids, it was kind of scary but realistic in my opinion.I thought the writing style was amazing - it was impossible to put the book down.
But man, I think Hunger is waaaay better than Gone.
The only problem I got while reading it was there is a freaking huge number of characters.
for this particular book.(Posted here).I guess the only weak point of the book is Sam and Astrid.
Its a little evil but I somehow been glad when Astrid got hit and Sam was whipped.
I hope Michael Grant can redeem these two characters since they are the leads.
But somehow I think I need to read something else first so that I wouldn't get the impression that HUNGER and LIES are not the same thing.
I like rereading books that I've enjoyed, and I wanted to reread the first two before reading the next two in the series.
But when I had free time, when I could've easily picked it up and read, I didn't have the desire.
It's an extremely unique idea; intriguing, powerful, intricate, horrifying, incredibly dark.
Like I said before, it's so incredibly unique, and once I really got into the action, I couldn't tear myself away.
I really like this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark, action-filled stories with sci-fi, mutations, and a lot of horror.
I don't know what it is about these books, but I am officially hooked.Between the mutant powers that kept sprouting up, the evil alien blob who lived underground, and the kids cooking the family pets...I just couldn't put it down!Every time I go to recommend this to a friend, I end up giving away the entire plot, so I'm gonna just shut up.For once.Read it for yourself and decide...
Putting this down for now. I'm just not in the mood to reread this anymore :(
All of the characters I had straight-up given up for dead -- Edilio, Dekka, Diana, Lana, even Sam, as I had a moment of thinking "man it would be a cool move to kill off the leader in the second book" -- were brought back, thanks to Lana's power.
“How long before we have kids doing worse than killing cats?”  When Astrid didn’t answer, Sam said, “Yeah, so I’m worried.***  “You know, we should have hung out more, back in the old days,” Howard said to Albert.
(hide spoiler)] All other characters  I like Edillio but I think he is a bit forgettable.
The same goes for Dekah for me.I did like Brianna in this book and (view spoiler)[ hope to see more between her and Jack.
Orc seems, maybe, like he's trying to be better overall though.I'm not sure how to feel about Albert at this point.
(view spoiler)[ I felt so bad for Duck and Hunter!
I really hope Duck is not dead and I feel bad that Hunter got exiled!
(hide spoiler)] I am really interested to see what role Brittney has in future books!Petey also is having some crazy dreams!
Definitely better than the first book, and there are a few things that occurred in this one that made the first book make more sense, relevant characters etc.
Sometimes I do have to remind myself they're all 15 and under, the way some of them act makes me be like oh my god you're far too young but at the same time I'm sure they'll have had to grow up in a sense very quickly.Didn't absolutely love it but was definitely an enjoyable read and I'll be continuing the series.
I think Lana is the best character so far. Very strong personality and strong will. The line " I am Lana Arwen Lazar. My Dad was into comic books, so he named me Lana for Superman's girlfriend Lana Lang. And my mom added Arwen for the elf princess in the Lord of the Rings. And I never, ever do what I'm told" is the best!Brianna has the cutest personality.Diana, a masochist.Caine, a sadist.Caine & Diana, tend to swap places.Drake, plain mean.Kids, swapping sides because of.... FOOD?
Blown away again?! Wow.First Impressions:1) Michael Grant knows how to build the climax and write an ending!2) 590 pages, and I was engaged through most of the book. Woah.3) Heart-wrenching! Emotions overflowed. Anger, frustration, indifference, pride, fear, happiness, desperation. AHHH!!!4) Some of these kids I just want to punch in the face.5) When you think things can't get more over-the-top, Grant throws more weird, crazy stuff in your face.6) Seriously. This was good. Possibly better than the first..Check out my video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeeCUR...
4.5 starsThis is easily my favorite of the series so far. Onto book 3!
4.5 starsReally captivating story, but I liked book number one better. And I guess I wanted more background story about how the Darkness came to be. I hope that I'll get more answers in the sequels. I will continue the series in a short while, just having a break with another book. ^^
I really loved all that character development in this book.
I love Sam, Astrid and Edilio but I also have taken a liking to side characters Brianna and Dekka.
Dekka on the other hand is also a fun character, she can levitate things with her mind, who doesn't love that?
She is another person who could very easily be your best friend but she she seems like the type of friend that will be honest with you about anything and that's why I love Dekka.
Anyway this is still a fun, sadish, gross and entertaining book and a great sequel!
"Superpowers don't always make you a superhero." It's been 3 months since all the adults disappeared. Gone.But Perdido Beach has even more major problems.

Gone.But Perdido Beach has even more major problems.
Will the zekes lead everyone to starvation?Meanwhile, Caine has a plan to lower the morale of Perdido Beach by shutting off the power.
And what is the gaiaphage?Hunter is a mutant that can fire microwaves from his hands.
Or will someone save him?Also, the Darkness has been calling to Lana, and she decides to go to the mine shaft to try to kill it?
Will the Darkness take control of her?This was soo good!
It's nice to have a comic relief scene after all that action and dark times.
This is one good book that you wouldn't wanna miss.
Hunger had just as much excitement, chaos, and action as its predecessor, with a little bit more characterization.I loved how the main character, Sam Temple, evolved in this book.
Despite this, however, Sam still manages to keep himself together enough to deal with all of the issues going on in the FAYZ, including the new problem of the mutants versus normals, which emerges in this book.I only had one problem with Hunger, and that would be that the ending didn't seem very realistic to me.
**minor spoiler**the ending seemed all wrapped up with a neat little bow.
**end spoiler**.Overall, Hunger was definitely a worthwhile read.
If you enjoyed the first book in the series, I'd recommend that you check out the second.
I loved it!
The characters are well developed, interesting.
The writing is captivating enough to keep you interested until the end and leave you wanting more.
Overall, loved it, I recommend reading!!

*minor spoilers*I felt like I had to plow through the book because absolutely nothing was getting done about 2/3rds of the way through, and I personally hate reading about idiots (coughZilcough).
It wrapped up nicely, but at the same time, set up questions to be answered in the third book.side note: One thing I really like about these books is the diversity of the characters.
Being an Asian myself, I like seeing Asian characters in a book since in all the YA books I've read, only a couple have had an Asian play an important role.
The fact that it was never content to have a single crisis ocurring at once, or the way that it calls the thinking reader to question what exactly is right and wrong and good and evil.
There used to be a spooky saying that once committed to it, women were the fiercest, least sympathetic warriors, well kids make the meanest, most believeable villains, perhaps because there's much recognizeable truth in their willingness to cause chaos for chaos sake without respect to anyone else's feelings.
Kids also make the best psychopaths.
Any way you slice it, this book is a good engrossing read.
