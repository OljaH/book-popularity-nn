Sloppy Firsts  is not only the type of book you finish wanting to read it again (or pick up the sequel because of its cliffhanger ending), but it is also the type of book you finish feeling wiser about the world in general and I love that.
Nevertheless, the best part about  Sloppy Firsts  is the fact that the two most influential people in Jessica’s life, Hope and Marcus, are conspicuously absent for most of it.
It’s funny while tackling serious issues, hilarious while representing a true form of high school and teenage life, and it has one of the best female heroines to grace Contemporary YA Fiction.
The main difference that stood out is that this book is much ruder - in a funny way - compared to Louise Rennison's pretty tame stories.
Like this where Jessica is asked to sign the yearbook of a fellow student who has a crush on her:Pierre,I've always admired your ability to conjugate a verb.
Oh yeah, and the other difference between this and the Georgia stories is that there are some serious issues in this book - like death and family matters - whereas, Georgia wouldn't know serious if it hit her in the face.
I thought it was going to be about a teenage girl's sex life.
As a teenage girl myself, I can say that we pretty much are all annoying.
This book reminded me that I wasn't the only confused, lonely girl in high school.
I would be reading along, laughing and musing with Jessica, and stumble on a quote that pretty much sums up my exactly feelings.
Jessica seemed like she could have been an actual person.
She was a fully fleshed-out characters, as was the majority of the cast.
Overall, I'm really glad I walked into Goodwill that day.
It's difficult to read that stuff since we're so attuned to it today, but back in 2000 I didn't even know what slut shaming was, let alone that it was a bad thing, so yes, this book is a product of it's time.
However, the love interest is an interesting character and brings about several positive changes in Jessica's life so I do like him as a character and I bet a lot of other readers would do a fair amount of swooning.
The only thing that annoyed me a bit in this one was the cliff-hanger-like ending, but because I loved the book so much, I decided to be forgiving about it.A few notes on the German translation: After a while, I got used to it, but at the beginning the frequent use of English words like ‘prom’ (Although we don’t have proms in Germany the way they have them in the US, there is still a German word for it.) felt weird.
Also, what was the thing about the abbreviations of the swear words Scotty uses?
Re-read 9/20/17: So upon re-reading this forThrowback Thursday, my rating has gone down from 5 stars to 4 stars due to some pretty problematic elements that exist in this book (slut shaming, slurs, cheating, etc.).
These are things that I didn't notice back when I first read this book about a decade ago and tbh I'm a little embarrassed that I have recommended this book to so many people since then.
WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID: I still thoroughly enjoyed this book and I love Jessica and Marcus (and even Bridget and Pierre).
The synopsis just didn't sound that special I suppose, because on the surface, "Sloppy Firsts" is just your regular run-of-the-mill YA story about a smart 16-year old girl (Jessica Darling), her relationship with her best friend who is away, her parents and cheerleader so-called friends, her obsessions over boys, all in a diary format.
And the fact that Jessica manages to push all THIS away with a firm hand just proves one more time why I love and identify with her so much.The main negative about "Sloppy First" is its the setting-up-for-the-sequel ending.
I've put off writing my review for Sloppy Firsts for a long time.
I hadn't even heard of this series prior to starting my blog.
Yes, Marcus.
The journal-style writing makes it easy to become completely immersed into Jessica's internal cynicism and outlook on life.
There are so many quotes that have caused me to burst into laughter--this never happens--or made me write down a quote or 352 in my review journal.
This is a series I think everyone should read.
I'm taking my time with this series, because I don't want it to ever, ever end.
Whether it was Burke or Bridget or Marcus or Manda or Sara, I was hooked, lined, and snickered, and I found myself reeling in a big mouth bass.Whether I actually did or not is hard to say, but I found myself bouncing along the halls with my head held high and my corduroys on rye and a picture perfect wave across the sky helping me find my way home.If I really stop to think about it, I probably shouldn’t have fallen in love with this novel, but you can’t always choose what books you love, and in this case, I tried to say no, but I ended up saying yes.
It's McCafferty traveling back in time and stealing pages from my high school diary -- not the proper one I left behind for my mother and, okay, posterity because I had a heightened sense of self, but the real one I kept locked in my head, full of doubts, fears, hopes, wants, desires, and prejudices.
From the time Jessica Darling thinks "Manda thinks that reading feminist manifestos makes up for her borderline ho-bag behavior" and refers to her as "The Headmaster" on page ten, I knew I was in book love.
Well now, this was refreshing!My namesake Jessica is a very likable protagonist, whom I could easily relate to.
Her BFF Hope was shipped off to Tennessee and now she’s stuck with a clique of seemingly dumb girls she doesn’t really like (The Clueless Crew), her crush doesn’t even know her name and is absolutely unattainable for her, she feels misunderstood by her parents and her perfect older sister, who totally overshadows her, is being a pain.
(****spoiler in the next sentence*****) Why couldn't she have thrown up on Paul Parlipiano's shoes in the second or third month of the book and gone from there?
(***spoilers over***) I also thought the writing style was trying too hard to be hip and clever.It probably didn't help that I read this right after several really good Sarah Dessen books so I couldn't help but compare the two authors.
While it had its good points and I did find myself wanting to know what happened after Sloppy Firsts left off I don't think I'll be running out to pick up Second Helpings anytime soon.
Had stupid grin on my face for the last half of this. Must start book two now. Have feeling may not emerge until series finished. Sorry can't talk good, am too excited.FEELS.
Thank you thank you thank you Chelsea for making me read this <3 I related to it so much more than I ever thought I would.
At page 88 I wondered why I was still reading it...then at page 108 I wondered how a writer could write such a pointless book.
Doesn't make it entertaining or good.At some point a nice little character named Marcus helped the book pick up a little and then the story line ended as abruptly as the book with promises of another chapter in the Jessica Darling angst-fest...no thanks, I'll pass.Edit: I did find one line that was worth reading and proved meaningful..."I watch my life depart minute by minute....I anticipate the end of everything and anything...I'm continually waiting for something better that never comes.
Some men go through their mid-life crisis by buying a nice red sports car, and marrying their 25 year old secretaries.
I go through my mid-life crisis by doing Yoga, eating coffee Häagen-Dazs ice cream, watching John Hughes films, and lately...reading YA novels.SLOPPY FIRSTS is wonderful!
Shhhh don't tell my boyfriend.I gave this book four stars, but it really is out of the embarrassment of enjoying this book- at the age of 46- as much as I did.
It should be rated at 5 stars...and at some point I may change it.
If I was 16 years old again I would say......"Jessica Darling is TRE'COOL"!!!
What I expected was a chick lit, a cheesy story of a teenager and her ramblings about boys.
But this is a coming of age story.Jess is a stressed teenager whose best friend has just moved away and whose parents try to make her be something she is not.
She tries to mold herself into being what everybody expects from her in order to fit in until a junkie guy, Marcus Flutie, makes her realize her priorities in life.I liked this book for various reasons: first, even though i'm 34 and therefore well past my teenage years, Jess is a character i could easily relate too.
oh lord, i really wanted to give this book 5 stars.
something is holding me back, maybe because it feels weird to give a new YA lit book that much praise?
4 1/2 stars, 4 1/2 dammit!
i LOVED this book.
LOVED IT.
it's just really refreshing to read a book about a typical teenage girl who has regular problems like a best friend that moves away and crushes on random boys, including one of her weird guy friends.
i had ordered the next two in this series before i'd even finished the book.
(EDIT: FIVE STARS IT IS!
I liked it, but I have to say it was completely different from what I had expected - but not in a bad way, not at all.
But I would have decided on a different title-and-cover-combo, if it would have been my call at the publisher's table eleven years ago.
Jessica Darling is anything but darling–so much so that her father calls her Notso.
He takes it as a personal insult when she breaks her leg one night and is out for the rest of the season.And then there’s Marcus, the class junkie, who keeps showing up wherever Jessica is and knows way too much about her.
Marcus, who might be the best thing since Hope left...Biting, funny and well written, this is not standard chick-lit fare.
This is a great book for teens who read the teen lit stuff and want to bridge to more serious stuff (and contains lots of good vocab words).
Disclaimer: Snark and gifs.Dis book.I'm sitting here looking at the blinking curser trying to sum up my feelings for this trash.Sums up my sarcastic feelings of this novel.Jessica is an annoying main character.
So much wangsting.
So much judging.
I mean this girl hates her friends.
So much fucking slut shaming.
She also is straight edge all the way, and judges everyone who has sex and does drugs.
*hulk smash*Basic Bitch.In Jessica's world feminism = slut.
YES!!!Also drugs and sex r bad.
mmmkay Marcus is my fave character.
I would read a book about him.Drugs are bad tho.
I hope I don't kill the love for this series by admitting that I am a middle aged woman who loves it.
Although Jessica Darling is less than half my age, I would have loved to be friends with her in high school...or even now.
Jessica is an acerbic, rapier witted narratrix.
I started this series back when I was a librarian for teenagers...and had a solid excuse.
If Jessica continues to balance the snark and the insights in her own special way, I am a fan for life and will follow her adventures into the nursing home, if possible.
REREAD: October 8, 2017:did I really just reread this only seven months after reading this for the first time? yes, yes I did. and it's still a spanking five star fave. Jessica Darling is such a great protagonist and oh Marcus Flutie. ORIGINAL review feb 23, 2017:Wow. I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did. This was great.
This was hilarious, and adorable, and endearing. It made me bust out laughing, and occasionally want to cry. I didn't want it to end.I also can't believe it just ended that way! I want to know more. I NEED to know more!I'll most definitely be reading the rest of this series, no doubt about that!
At first I was even rooting for Scotty.If Scotty had wound up with Jessica, and if Bridget had become Jessica’s best friend, this would’ve been a true original, a “classic” as Marcus would call it.
Most importantly, this book would have succeeded in rejecting the biggest chick-lit tropes known to man.
However, I am willing (!) to not know Marcus (!!) if it means that McCafferty makes Sloppy Firsts into the one and only chick lit that takes me off guard.But she didn’t.And that’s why this book is pure chick-lit.
I got caught up in this book.
It's well-written and engaging, even when the characters are, well, teens—by which I mean selfish and a little mean and so caught up in their own pain they don't recognize the hurt they're giving others.I liked Jess, but only barely.
Indeed, the humor and wit of the book are crucial to how engaging it is and pull you seamlessly through the hard times as Jess grows in maturity and understanding and courage.Indeed, this was cruising on a steady four stars the whole time I was reading.
Until I got to the ending.
I struggled to rate this one. There were times when this book was everything I wanted it to be and other times it just wasn't. I rounded higher because I want to read the second book right away and that must be a good sign. For some reason coming of age novels are my go to books for Summer. edit: After reading second book in series, lowered rating to 3. Second one much better.
I feel slightly disappointed with this book, I had such high hopes going into it, I’m contemplating whether I should read the rest of the series or not now.
Even after her grueling training sessions, when she can’t sleep in the middle of the night, Jess gets up and goes running, hoping that she’ll tire herself out so she can sleep.
Turns out that he and Jess have far more in common than she originally thought – not that she was thinking of him, no sir, someone like Jessica Darling would never be thinking of someone like Marcus Flutie – and talking to Marcus in the middle of the night seems to be the only way Jess can get herself to sleep.
Sloppy Firsts is an adult series about an intelligent, angst ridden, sexually repressed 16 year old teenager, misunderstood by most, and admired by a few, Jessica Darling.
Just remembering that cracks me up, cause let’s face it, who hasn't done that?Most disturbing, Jessica's best friend Hope has moved to TN and Jessica is left alone, with no one to help her endure the Clueless Crew, Scotty's advances, or dissect the weird occurrences with Marcus Flutie.Jessica just can't get happy.
She suspects schizophrenia.Reading Sloppy Firsts was a lot like reading the recesses of my own mind.
