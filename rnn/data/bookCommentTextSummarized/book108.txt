A good history but a bit boring read.
Some timeless insights (and hard common sense) on the traits and thinking patterns that make a good owner operator type CEO.
I almost gave up on this book because it started off as random advice with no context. But once the story started everything started to make sense and I found myself really enjoying it towards the end. The early automobile industry reminds me a lot of Silicon Vally today. I think this book is a great read for anyone in the tech industry or who wants to be a CEO some day.
I really enjoyed this book and even better to be read after My Life and Work by Henry Ford.
