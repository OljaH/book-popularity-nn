3 StarsI like sexy books.
Y'all know that.It is also well known, that I enjoy reading about damaged, hot, arrogant, alpha males.But, huge BUT....
I like some plot too!
He breaks out a freaking contract!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Well, sure...
These two knuckleheads (more so Gabe) hide behind the freaking contract and just refuse to face reality...
Admittedly, this book is saved by the pretty good sex, a grovel to end of grovels and a fairytale (view spoiler)[marriage proposal (hide spoiler)].My exact feelings during the book:By the way, I'm definitely reading the next!

You don’t ever shut me out.” 21% “Say my name, Mia. Who owns you?
*gag*Then at the 35% we have Gabe the “hero” rape her mouth, brutalized her with all his manly, manliness of beastly peen, some self-loathing ensued, he got over his feelings and decided he’d do it again.*sigh* …not.At the 38% mark he goes all alpha-caveman (because we’re told that) but the truth is: he’s an asshole, control freak, bordering on abusive.
Gabe treated her like a whore throughout 75% of the book.
3 1/2 starsI struggled with portions of this book and had a very difficult time with the hero, Gabe, and his jerky and selfish behavior.
I can honestly say, I don't think I've ever read a more jerky and selfish hero.
There was nothing sexy or appealing about him or his behavior!
That said, I ended up enjoying this story more than I thought I would.
Note: I know some may compare this book to Fifty Shades, but this story is NOT a Fifty Shade's "knock off" in any way shape or form.
Trust me, it's its own story and a brilliantly written one at that!
Jace's friends Gabe and Ash have been like brothers to her growing up, but now that she's older, Mia can admit to herself that she's had more than sisterly feelings towards Gabe.
And Mia, bless her heart, is up for the challenge.:)Now, I must admit, there came a time when I was getting just a wee bit bored reading about Gabe and Mia's sexual exploits.
Maya Banks kicks the book into high gear eventually, when Gabe is forced to admit his feelings for Mia (but not until he makes a huge mistake that nearly costs him everything.
I will admit that I didn't quite understand Gabe's feelings about not wanting to get "involved' again.
I was a little nervous about this one. The last couple of the “dominating billionaire” books I’ve read have been so so for me, and Maya Banks can be a hit or miss author for me. I’m so glad I took the chance.I really really enjoyed this one. Gabe   Mia  I loved the set up (I am a sucker for the “in love with my brother’s best friend” thing) Gabe was definitely your quintessential alpha male. Add to that a past which has left him with no ability to trust in a relationship, and an obsession with h
I loved watching Gabe struggle with his real feelings for Mia. I wanted to smack him more than once and tell him to stop being such a blind fool, but I still loved him.
The chemistry between Mia and Gabe was smokin’.
You don’t come with your eyes closed.
I want to see everything you have when I’m inside you.
“Don’t fall in love with me, Mia,” he warned.
I don’t want to hurt you.”…“That’s awfully presumptuous of you, Gabe.
Let me say this – sometimes having an asshole hero can be fun.
(and also no way as dominant as Gabe…)Gabe from Rush is just a plain asshole.
He has been lusting after his best friend’s sister, Mia for years and now that she is 24 (and he is 38 I think) he feels it’s time to make his move.
Mia has been lusting after Gabe as well.
I don’t want to feel bad when I read.
I want to experience situations that I may not like but dying to know how the hero/heroine will resolve the actions – but I don’t want to feel ill.
I don't like the characters at all, and so far haven't been able to identify a plot outside of sex.
And when Gabe says he's going to give the contract to his lawyer I burst out laughing.
No lawyer would do anything with a contract where a person signs away their basic human rights.
Gabe could draw up any contract he wants, but it would be a formality, not a legality.
SMH And, speaking of independence, Mia takes a "job" as Gabe's personal assistant and sex is a requirement of her job.
I don't like the characters or the story, not for me at all.
3  stars – Contemporary/Erotic/BDSM RomanceThoughts After Reading:This was a decent erotic romance, but I didn’t really connect with the characters. Their “relationship” felt a bit trite, dull, and emotionless, and I actually got bored with the sex scenes. The angst and drama seemed needless and calculated, although it resulted in some good groveling by the hero. I love Maya Banks, but this didn’t quite live up to my expectations. Hopefully Jace’s and Ash’s books will be better.Thoughts Before R
3 ½ stars – Contemporary/Erotic/BDSM RomanceThoughts After Reading:This was a decent erotic romance, but I didn’t really connect with the characters.
I love Maya Banks, but this didn’t quite live up to my expectations.
Hopefully Jace’s and Ash’s books will be better.Thoughts Before Reading:I’m a big Maya Banks fan and really looking forward to her Breathless trilogy, but I’m not crazy about the covers.What’s with this new artsy trend in romance/erotica covers anyway?
Even previously released authors are having their book covers reimaged.
All cold sex, absolutely no chemistry or sensuality.The guy - Gabe - is an arrogant, selfish asshole who doesn't care about anything except fulfilling his control-freak needs and banging his best friend's sister. He whips out a contract before every sexual relationship so the women can't accuse him of abuse. And he is jealous to the point of being genuinely scary. There is also nothing outside of the sex - no flirtations, no funny conversation or banter, just sex. It was boring and I hated Gabe.
Gabe’s purpose of Mia’s non traditional working relationship is so she will be by his side at all times with the condition that he’d have her when and how he wants her; body and soul.
He could say one thing all he wanted, but he was a damn liar and he knew it.”The flow of the story lacks luster because it’s a continuous cycle of Gabe initiating rough sex with Mia, treating her like a whore, feeling remorseful in the moment, then repeating the behavior again.
This book tells the story of Gabe, a billionaire Dom with a serious attraction to his best-friend's little sister, Mia. Of course, Mia is about as off-limits as a woman could be.
Predictably, Mia chooses to agree to the relationship with Gabe.
Little by little, Gabe introduces her to his world of kink.The story slowly progresses with a few smaller climactic moments along the way.
Then, every bit of progress that this couple had made seemed to evaporate.I was disappointed in Gabe's behavior more than once while reading this story.
I liked Mia, but without liking both of the main characters, this long story just got kind of tedious.
She was an obsession, and it made him uncomfortable to admit, but she was a drug in his veins he had no desire to cure himself of.   Her emotions were a mixture of holy fuck and oh my God. ▬Same same with how I feel after reading the book.There are some similarities with FSoG but this is different. It has its own level of "fuck up-ness". tsk!tsk!tsk! The blurb says Gabe have this obssession with his bestfriend sister, Mia. He propose an agreement to her. To own her. Mia with her huge attraction
▬Same same with how I feel after reading the book.There are some similarities with FSoG but this is different.
The blurb says Gabe have this obssession with his bestfriend sister, Mia. He propose an agreement to her.
This book is full of struggle, a lot of groveling and at times I just want to shake Mia to wake up from her dreams turning to nightmare.
Best line (ATTA GIRL MIA!):“I risked everything for you.
One day you’re going to wake up and figure out that I was the best thing that ever happened to you and that you made the biggest fucking mistake of your life.
I actually wanted good things for this couple....."You're so fucking beautiful," he said in a rough voice.
His partner Jace has a hot little sister (24 year old Mia).
Gabe has known Mia most of her life and never really looked at her as more than a kid sister.
Gabe suddenly realizes the beautiful sweet thing that Mia is and he wants her....if she will just agree to sign the contract and keep their relationship a secret.
But can Mia keep this contracted relationship just a sexual thing?
I really need an deep emotional connection in my reads to feel good chemistry.
That is a book of the same type as the Fifty. Wealthy men in suits, possessive, dominant, wild hot scenes and a submissive women. Quite a ride, good to go back to this kind of a book. “Some crushes just never went away. They built, instead, into something permanent, obsessive and all consuming.”  ***Quick Review:***Series:  The first of three books in the Breathless series.Grade:  Erotic Romance.

Wealthy men in suits, possessive, dominant, wild hot scenes and a submissive women.
Mia Crestwell, twenty-four, younger sister of Jace.Secondary characters:  We know here Jace Crestwell and Ash McIntyre, two friends, about whom will be the next parts.Steamy: Yes. A lot hot scenes.
(view spoiler)[ There are all kinds of hot-bdsm-type scene.

When hot nights and increasing feelings had already begun to overwhelm, Gabe decided into something that could destroy them both.Final thoughts: It did not go like I thought it would.
HOLY.HOTNESS.BATMAN. Gorgeous alpha businessman lusting after best friend's younger sister.Explosive sexual relationship.Fan-f*cking-tastic grovel to end all grovels. GO READ IT.
3.5* STARS!Plus:+ Great plot and fast paced.+ INTENSE. SEXY. HOT.+ Cheap thrills.Minus:- Mainstream hero.- Too obedient submissive wannabe- Not really BDSM.Overall: Maya Bank is one of my recommendation for sexy erotica books. I love her Sweet series and I think Rush is worth to try for you fans of Billionaire dominant :)

4 STARS ****  Rush by Maya Banks .The series :Breathless has Three books in it.Rush ,Fever, and Burn .Gabe Hamilton, Jace Crestwell and Ash McIntyre—who are best friends and business partners.
He wanted 24 Mia Crestwell- Jace's little sister.
He lusted over her, and the feeling was very mutual,after a very bad divorce, he started all his relashionships with woman in contracts, and Mia is no exception.I don't really have anything to say about this one, it wasn't original or wow in the story or the idea, but it was for sure hot and fun to read.
It had enough story line along with the spice to make the book intresting.
She signs the contract with her eyes wide open.So begins the spicy life of Mia and Gabe.
Mia's brother comes back from a business trip to the suprise of his sister working for Gabe as a personal Assistant they don't tell him about the naughty bit.
Untill mia's brother and friend come upon them in Gabe's lounge and she is tied up the s hits the fan as they say.
...I was suprised at mia's choice she is a very sweet person and brave to sign the contract.
is nervous, concerned but goes through with it anyway...cause it is GABE....He is all she has wanted, feels nothing ventured -nothing gained.Mia's character gave me problems too.
And she is his to do Whatever he wants...I am not going to go into all the things about this book that take place.You can read my journey with Gabe and Mia better through my updates.What I am going to say is just when there might have been a breakthrough in Gabe's behavior and some real understanding of who he was, what he was feeling and where this might go...
I hate to give an author less than 4 stars.
Especially Maya Banks - just went through some of her other books that I have read and they all got 5 stars.
Need to rate the others that I have read like the Highland series but I know there were high stars also.
I just felt I had read this before.
OK, I like the sex scenes but after the Paris encounter just went off the whole book ...
Yep. Will I get the next in the series - probably not, especially at those prices.
Need to find something totally different to read now.
alpha-hole (courtesy of  Broughttoyoubymybrain )the alpha hole is very often confused with the alpha male. They have the same characteristics of the alpha male only they are assholes. The Alpha-hole always takes things too far. He often does and says unforgivable things, has a 'black out' temper, is possessive to the point of insulting, and never grovels. The alpha-hole is usually matched up with a nice doormat who'll take his shit with a smile.***************************************************
If you like that type of thing or are a forgiving sort you might be able to enjoy this book more than I did.
Mia has always been “forbidden fruit” but that didn’t stop Gabe from secretly wanting to take a bite.
Now that she’s 24 and the fruit has ripened sufficiently Gabe decides it’s time to make his move on his best friend’s little sis.
At times he reads the words as if he’s in a hurry to end this gig as quickly as he can,which was fine by me because I pretty much felt the same way.
I feel like this book is such a ripoff of that that I was wondering why I was reading this book over that one!I have found that I fully HATE "Relationship Contract" romances.
Though the whole book I keep wanting to throw it into the fire for her stupidity, his controlling ways and MANY other things!
I feel like this level of emotion could of been reached without that stupid paper and having that be a part of their life and why she never thinks nothing can come of this relationship.
Gabe is a hotel mogul..he, along with Mia's big brother, Jace and their other best friend, Ash, build and run hotels in the US and overseas.
She never once argued or rebuked a single thing...she just complied like a good little girl.
Their relationship dynamic changed...it actually turned into something likeable, and drama, along with a little suspense, ensues..THAT is what i'd been waiting for throughout the entire book!
First of all, the hero talked like every other "damn" hero in Maya Banks contemporaries (save for her HQN Desires which ban the damns and the rest).
. .MORE SPOILER AHEAD *stop reading if you don't want to know!* So after a lot of internal things and much telling by the author and not showing, we get to see total humiliation to Mia by her being caught by HER BROTHER Jace when she's being whipped by Gabe.
As another reviewer said on Amazon, Gabe wanted to own and command Mia to his will and selfish liking, but hold no responsibility to what comes with being a master.
I've had this on my shelf for a while waiting for the urge to read a controlling-billionaire-meets-innocent themed book to return.
At one time this set up was in every book I read and I'd got more than a little jaded with it.
He's a self made billionaire who makes all of his women sign a contract giving him complete ownership.
And with business associates too...nope, just didn't get that at all, seemed OOC for someone who makes his women sign a confidentiality contract to suddenly start slinging his wiener around following a business meeting, but what do I know.
Ohhhh my emotions! Deep breath.Okay I don't know what I expected going into this book, but damn was my heart shattered to bits in the best and worst ways.I truly felt like I knew the characters--especially Jace, Ash, and Gabe within the first chapter! Gabe as a character was presented in a nutshell without leaving the readers feeling like we were TOLD who he was instead of learning about him. I don't know how Maya did it but, damn, what a great job she did!This entire book was to-die-for incredible. The title speaks for itself.
No me gustó el tema
And he has decided that their time is now.Mia has always had a crush on Gabe, so when he offers her a job as his personal assistant, and then presents her with the chance to be with him in the way she has dreamed of for years, she is stunned.
The progression of the relationship comes as no surprise as Mia falls hopelessly in love with Gabe, and in return he is stunned at his emotional response to her.
Sure, it’s not the most original of storylines, and there’s not much going on outside of the relationship, but the dual POV keeps things interesting, and I really enjoyed the way it all played out.
I enjoyed this book. The beginning reminded me a lot of Fifty Shades of Grey, but as the story progressed it took a different path and the story line managed to shift into a different yet interesting direction. I also enjoyed *Gabe* and *Mia's* characters and I thought they had great chemistry. I recommend this book and I will definitely be reading the second book in the series of *Jace* and *Ash's* story once it's released --> Love you Jace!!!******* 4 Stars******
Gabe Hamilton is a thirty eight year old dominant business man, who is business partners with Mia Crestwell's brother (Jace Crestwell) and best friend (Ash McIntyre).
I think it was a good read and I'm definitely going to check out the next two books on Jace and Ash.
I want to take care of her, make sure she never has to worry for anything that I can give her...All I can think of are daughters who look just like her...I've never felt this way about another woman.
