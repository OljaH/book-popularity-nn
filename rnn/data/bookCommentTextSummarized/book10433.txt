I was hoping I wouldn't have to dedicate lengthy periods of time to properly get into it to appreciate and enjoy the prose.
It didn't happen because even on those periods when I had a few hours to kill the last thing I wanted to do was read more of the Ring/Sword of Shannara.
I gave up halfway through the second book because it wasn't getting any better.
When I'm reading for leisure I don't want to feel like I have to earn excitement.
There are perhaps two names that I could read without feeling slightly nauseous at how bad they were.
Brought out emotions in me that signify a great novel.THE WISHSONG OF SHANNARA: The story revolves around Jair and Brin Ohmsford, the children of the main characters from The Elfstones of Shannara: Wil Ohmsford and Eretria.
The siblings, each possessing an inherited magic, must save the Four Lands from the evil magic within a tome called the Ildatch, a book created by demons containing their essence.The wishsong is my favorite of all the magics in Shannara.
Inherited genetically from their Ohmsford heritage, the wishsong works differently for Brin and Jair.
The Sword of Shannara 2.5/5 Stars*************Coming into this series, I had already watched and read a lot of mediocre reviews.
I was well aware that this book was very heavily inspired by Lord of the Rings and I'm glad I was prepared for this because even though I knew it, throughout the book I found myself saying 'Lord of the Rings', 'Lord of the Rings,' and 'oh, more Lord of the rings!'I wish I liked The Sword of Shannara more than I did because I do feel, despite being inspired by Tolkien's Middle Earth, that Brooks really created an amazing world with a fabulous history.
I also feel that Wishsong has a lot more real Allanon moments.
Finalmente è finito.Mi dispiace per la valutazione poco generosa ma il palesissimo plagio a Il Signore degli Anelli e la totale prevedibilità della saga mi hanno talmente irritata che ho fatto davvero fatica a portare a termine il terzo volume, tralasciando anche ben più di qualche paragrafo qua e là.Probabilmente se l'avessi letto da ragazzina - e magari prima del SDA -, l'avrei apprezzato molto più, ma dopo 6 mesi dall'inizio della lettura posso solo dire di essere parecchio contenta di lasciarmi questo mattone alle spalle.
I went specificly looking for an Epic Fantasy series that could engross me as much as A Song of Ice and Fire, The Lord of the Rings, or The Wheel of Time.
I found this highly reccomended and went into it expecting to love it.
I am unsure why this gets listed as being on par with the other series I listed.
The writting is really sub-par.
You don't know from one sentence to the next whose thoughts you might be hearing.
I read the entire first novel and am going to take a break from it, and I don't know that I will ever return.
A Druid named Allanon comes looking for the half elf Shea so he can get the sword to destroy the Warlock Lord.
Closing this up before I tell the whole story, Menion Leah finds a woman he saves and falls in love with, a few of them die and the day is saved when they finally get the sword and kill the Warlock Lord.
He asks Brin to come on a journey with him to use her wishsong to destroy a book or the same ole junk is going to happen.
I then learned the show was based on a book series, and I knew I had to read them.
I think the timelessness of his work is the depth he gave Arda, not the strength of the novels' writing.Anyway, the Tolkien similarities aren't what made me quit the book.
I actually love adverbs and don't feel that they deserve the bad rap the get, but my god...
Honestly, it's a shame the series turned out to be such a disappointment.
It's a shame that a show produced for MTV of all things has me more invested than its source material.
Witness, for example, the third book in the trilogy - in which the heroine must take a powerful magical artifact and hurl it into a river of fire in order to destroy it.Yes. Seriously.Almost every element of the trilogy has some parallel from that famous trilogy, which is a shame, because the first several chapters of the Shannara trilogy started out pretty great and roped me in.The biggest difference is that LOTR's Gandolf was kind of a bad ass.
Couldn't finish the third installment. It's basically a poorer version of Lord of the Rings. Scenes that are almost identical to Tolkien's but without the storytelling ability of Tolkien. Each book starts exactly the same way. Exactly. The. Same. Way. To be fair it was written awhile ago when Tolkien was basically the epic fantasy template and I have heard the series greatly improves as it goes on. Maybe someday I will continue it.
I'm a huge fantasy fan and someone recommended this to me with the immortal tag line " If you liked LOTR you'll love this".Well of course I would.
A young hero is sent away from the home he loves because his life is in danger from an evil lords creatures ( Check ).
They have to go through a dark forest filled with danger where they are saved by a random stranger before one of them is nearly eaten by a tree ( Check ).
They have to go through the mountain and not over it because of the dark lords spies ( Check ).
Lo stile scorrevole accompagna l'intera storia e la trama risulta semplice ma estremamente visiva nelle descrizioni e nelle caratterizzazioni dei protagonisti.
Godibile e nulla più, lo riconosco, ma è riuscito a intrattenermi.— Le pietre magiche —  Un po' meno coinvolgente del primo volume, nonostante la tematica di fondo sia interessante.
Finale toccante, ma incapace di riabilitare l'intera storia.
— La Canzone di Shannara —  Più dinamico del precedente e meno incisivo del primo, si lascia leggere.
In conclusione: medesimo schema di fondo in tutti e tre i romanzi, con un Brooks che rende piacevole la lettura arrivando ad una risicata sufficienza.
I like fantasy based books.I didn't like this one.It basically tells the same story three times while switching the coveted object and the names of the characters...
It was pretty obvious that the author tried to emulate Tolkien...
tried and completely failed.
How I even managed to read all three stories, I'll never know, and now it's something I'll never be able to erase from my memory.This book was given to me by a friend who obviously just wanted to get rid of it.I don't know if I have a friend I actually hate enough to give it to.
just 60 pages in so far, but it's already terrible. A rope appears out of nowhere, then disappears when one would expect it to still exist. Somewhat repetitive encounters with monsters. Pages-at-a-time of plot lifted almost verbatim from the Lord of the Rings. Reading this is a chore, which I might as well avoid.
Well nothing can equal Brook's stories when it comes to high fantasy. He is a master. You simply won't be dissapointed by any of his books. Who doesn't love elves, griffins, orcs and demons? (Ok not the demons but they are necessary for the story). If you want to be taken to another world and time - this is it
After seeing the trailer for this (new TV show on MTV!) I really want to read it!
I recalled enjoying the books and for years have wanted to reread them, but the reread has left me wondering what exactly left such a powerful impression.The Sword of Shannara - 4 stars - definitely introduced to me a more contemporary fantasy storyline that was unlike anything since The Lord of the Rings.
To me it lacked the more personal character development, but for what it was it still was very good.The Wishsong of Shannara - 5 stars - THis was my favorite of the trilogy.
Technology as we know it has fallen and has sent Earth into a time similar to the medieval era.The story begins with a mysterious, forbidding, cloaked man arriving in a small village with a message of warning.
There is an ancient evil—once banished—that has returned to the Earth, and Shea alone holds the key to unlock the power to defeat it.And thus begins an exciting adventure, following this young boy who has been thrown into an all new world from the likes he is used to—with dangers at every turn and new, relatable allies to aide the cause of his journey.
The gnome, dwarf and troll species have always lived on earth hidden from man, the book never explains where the elves come from.
Maybe that will be explained in a future story.________________________________________________________________________In the "Elfstones of Shannara", Wil Ohmsford, the son of Shea is called upon to take up the elfstones and save the world from the invading demons.
As in the first, it becomes a story of self discovery and how best to use the magic.________________________________________________________________________In the "Wishsong of Shannara" brother and Sister, Brinn and Jair have been born with elven magic.
Their journeys will save the world from the dark power of the ancient book, the Ildatch.
10% = Negative Stars?I know that I am in the vast minority when it comes to these books but I didn't like them and it was slight torture reading them. Maybe my expectations were too high, that is very possible. Anyway, labeling this as 'Not my cup o' tea' because obviously some large group of people enjoyed this one.
They are very similar in style and content, but where I noticed differences, I will point that out.I decided to buy this trilogy after watching the Shannara Chronicles TV series — one of the few times that I’ve purchased a book after watching a visual media production.
This makes for a good action-adventure story, but I, personally, need more character dialog and interaction to prevent stories from being “just” hero quests.Also, my favourite aspect of this series, is underplayed: the setting of the world itself.
While Elfstones was a good read and much better written than Sword, it had many of the same plot devices and many of the characters from Sword were recycled into "new" characters in Elfstones.
I'm guessing that Wishsong will be similar and I'm afraid that if I read them all at once, I'll get annoyed at the similarities and won't enjoy it.
While the plot was similar to Sword and many of the characters similar if not the same, he does such a damned fine job of telling his story that you have no choice but to get wrapped up in it.
At the very beginning, I did think it felt kinda like a Tolkien rip-off, but that fairly quickly subsided.
What struck me the most was the character development.
I really liked and related to the main characters in all 3 books of the trilogy.
Brooks seems to really love jumping around during exciting moments though, to other story threads, to keep you reading 'till the end.
These stories may not make you have some sort of epiphany about life, but they are still highly entertaining.
I'd recommend this trilogy to anyone, especially those into epic/high fantasy.
This is like a weird acid-tripped reader's digest version of The Lord of the Rings.
Replace "The Ring" with a sword, the wizard with a druid, and hobbits with humans and apparently that is enough to not get sued for copyright infringement.
The characters definitely carried me through what was an annoyingly familiar story.The other two books in the trilogy are more original than the first, though repetitive plot-wise:  must find  in order to SAVE THE WORLD!
The writing and storytelling improve with each book, however, and the next series (Heritage) is much better, but probably wouldn't make much sense without starting from the beginning.
The Sword of Shanarra I actully read back in 1979/1980 time frame and I have to say it drew me into the story just like it did 30 years ago.This time I noticed that Terry Brooks seemed to like the word awesome alot.
I didn't notice this so much the first time I read it probably because I was a teenager and that was literally a major part of my own vocabulary.The use of awesome did not distract from the story at all and I mean nothing negative by it.
Difficult one this - I read these books as a teenager and really liked them.
It's actually 3 books, and the first - the sword of Shannara is really just a thinly veiled knock off of Lord of the Rings.
Re-reading it as an adult was a bit of a disappointment to be honest, but the next book (Elf stones) is actually really good...
(still half way through the final book wish song).Some of Brooks recent books are brilliant, but mostly seem to be based on the same world as his first book.
I do think it's a shame he shackled himself to a book which he wrote as a journeyman author....
A commonly recommended series, I wouldn't disregard it since it has some interesting aspects, such as the role of druids as leaders and various ancient talismans used by characters who are forced to develop in order to prove their worth. (This does not mean that you grow to like the characters, though.) However, the future/add-on series that eventually loop into a yet another, seemingly unaffiliated, further series slowly degrade in the quality vs. quantity of publishing. Quite sad.
This was a fun series and so easy to read. Each book is a slightly different but similar adventure describing an against all odds battle between good and evil. While I enjoyed the first of these the most, the world Terry Brooks has invented is full of interesting characters and has a well developed backstory. One thing that's very interesting is to see his development as a writer since these were three of his earliest novels before he pursued writing as a full time career.
If you can force yourself to sit through the first half of the book, the rest of it is awesome! The first half is very slow because it has a lot of set-up for the rest of the series.
Chris Casler got me into this series. It's awesome, and I've enjoyed all of them so far. Keep in mind if you're going to start it that it's a very long series. This is only the beginning.
Terry Brooks never failsTerry can write one hell of an epic fantasy.This book was a great ending to an amazing trilogy! I had some much fun reading these books!
