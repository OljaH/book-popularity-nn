Excellent both as a study of Rembrandt's work and as a portrayal of the man and the culture in which he lived.
The book is ok.Not the best book on Rembrandt.Rembrandt was in a christian sect some think and also a book on Rembrandt should talk more about Calvenism and the freedom it gave artists.The big wonder is how did he paint his work,no one knows,we only know he worked very slow,many months on a painting. Well he is the greatest painter in the history of the world.
My favorite artist - brilliant!
Rembrandt was one of the most complex and multi-faceted artists of the 17th century. From his initial period in Leiden to his earlier and later phases in Amsterdam, the stages of Rembrandt's career mirror the artistic and intellectual developments of the century. This brilliantly written and detailed book takes you through the artist's life, giving exceptional insight to his life's changes and how they were reflected in his works. This is lavishly illustrated and brings a much deeper understanding to the paintings of one of the great masters. I felt this was the best book I had read this year.
Explored it a lot as a kid.
Rembrandt was een geniaal schilder en dit boek onderstreept dat alleen maar
Loved this book. But I love anything Rembrandt.
I wish there'd be more space for his biography.
Sort of dry but a very good deal on glossy color prints of this artists work.
i think this story full of sadness anf scare material things around those people who exsited in this story also the importance of characterestics.
very good
The paintings are beautifully reproduced, but the prose is turgid.
