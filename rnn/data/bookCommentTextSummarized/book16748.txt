The phrase is meant to pinpoint the exact moment when a TV series starts to go downhill.Passage To Dawn inspired me to come up with a similar phrase:"Training the seal."� It's meant to pinpoint the exact moment when a fantasy book series starts to go downhill.
"Training the seal"� refers to an incident in this book when Drizzt trains a seal to dive under water and find a magical statuette.
The seal incident is one of the many scenes that make Passage To Dawn the low point in the Drizzt saga.
Let's take the scene where Drizzt meets Cadderly, for example.
Another great volume in the ongoing Drizzt series. I read this for the first time back in 1998 or so, when I was in high school. I've since read it about 3 times, and it's worth it.This is the book where they're on the ship, going around the ocean for the first time. It's a fun book, quite a departure from what's come before. We do find ourselves back in the cold north later on, however. If you've come this far...keep going!
This has been my favorite of the Drizzt saga.. so far!! Can't wait till I can buy book XI!!
Together he, and Catti-Brie, one of the fairest women Drizzt had ever met, her adopted dwarven father, Bruenor Battlehammer, and their halfing friend Regis, the formidable team has fought Demons, evil wizards, a never ending horde of trolls, won a Drow war, killed a few dragons, on their adventures.
Catti-Brie is still only in her twenties, Bruenor and Regis would live for at least another century and Drizzt would live way longer than that!
The complex pasts and feeling of these characters are awesome,and the way they handle different situations are tactful, smart, and cool-headed, unless Catti-Brie or Bruenor are trying to throttle the guy talking to Drizzt.
Drizzt Do'Urden, the dark elven ranger, and Catti-brie, the human adopted daughter of the dwarven king Bruenor Battlehammer, have spent the years chasing pirates aboard the ship Sea Sprite with their friend Captain Deudermont.
Once there, Drizzt and Catti-brie are given a poem by an old witch, which hints that someone dear to Drizzt is held captive by a creature of the Abyss.
Despite the 16 or so years that have passed, and knowing that his father's spirit was released from the evil deity Lloth's grasp when he destroyed his reanimated body, Drizzt nevertheless assumes that it is his father who is held captive.
The whole story was fun and new, despite the fact that it slightly mirrored some of the earlier Drizzt adventures.Again, Salvatore's humor, wit, twists and tales of adventure, loyalty, friendship and good triumphing over evil truly drew me in.
I love that Harkell had an even larger and much more important role in this story, and I enjoyed the introductions of both Cadderly and Danica, and Ivan and Pikel.But the thing that really made this novel for me was the twist.
But, I allowed myself to get caught up in the story as Drizzt saw it, allowed myself to believe Drizzt's interpretation of Errtu's riddle, and thus allowed myself to be "tricked" by the "twist".
My new years resolution this year is to finish the Drizzt series (up to 13 since that's all I own and I will not buy more) and the Fire of Heaven Series by Russell Kirkpatrick (forgive me if I spell the name wrong).
I hate Drizzt.
Wow Salvatore, You're brilliant!"Ugh how much I do not want to read these books x_x--------------------------------------------Not much to say.
His book is just as bad as I thought it would be.
Also Catti-Brie is 27 in this book and she still acts like an ignorant teenage.Just like his character Salvatore hasn't grown at all.
So this is my least favorite Drizzt book so far. I don't really know why this series needed a 4th book. Some it was fun but some of it carried on for me. I am on my way though to catching up with the series!! http://angelasanxiouslife.blogspot.co...
Il finale é uno dei più emozionanti che abbia mai letto.Stupendo.
the whole of this novel i spent thinking the prisoner was Drizzt father and i wont spoil who it really was but i must admit it gave me literal goosebumps which a book has not done for a few years now.
there is a particularly touching moment with drizzt and his father towards the end of the novel which i think bring a lot of closure to their relationship.
i can usually be found on the floor after finishing one of these books, trying to continue with my life.)
I pulled out my old hardcover of Passage to Dawn and read it again recently.
Salvatore is a master at pulling the reader into the adventure.
And, I smiled at seeing other old friends such as Danica, Cadderly, Stumpet, Bruenor, Regis, Wulfgar, and, of course, Guenhwyvar.
Of all the books in the series, this one always felt like a class reunion more than a new adventure.
However, like any class reunion, it's hard to walk away without renewing old friendships, reminiscing on past adventures, and marveling at how far you've come since the old days.
Salvatore has definitely come far.
It didn't really fit in the series, I quite liked the ending of the last book and it could have been a nice ending to a trilogy, but Salvatore went on to tell what happened after the battle.
The first part was entertaining, but the identity of the prisoner was too obvious, I even feared who it was in the epilog of book three.
I believe to have heard that later on in the series R.A. Salvatore goes on to thin the ranks of Drizzt friends again, I'm looking forward to this :)One of the weakest Drizzt books I have read till now, but it certainly won't stop me to read on.
Yet another amazing installment of the Drizzt series by R.A. Salvatore!
In this one, Dirzzt and his friends are once again caught up in the evil machinations of the demon Errtu, and have to band together to defeat him.
I loved this story, as I have loved all of the Drizzt books so far.
I love the fight scenes that Salvatore crafts, he really knows how to make you feel as if you are there in the action with the characters.
And I love love LOVE the close relationship between Drizzt and his friends.
It never fails to make me feel warm and happy!
A nice break in the Drizzt series from the constant evil Drow killing, and always a nice change being set anywhere other than Menzoberranzan.Felt a little cheap having Crenshinibon and Errtu as the big bad evils again.When the true identity of Errtu's prisoner is revealed, I found it very emotional and joyous, if a little rushed over in the aftermath of the reveal.The seal taming part was a little stupid, and probably could've been accomplished in a different way... maybe with a return of a wizard.Overall still a great book in the series, can't wait to start book XI.
First I want to say I'm a long time R.A Salvatore fan and also a Drizzt fan (no not a fanboy fan, fanboys are weirdos).Ok let's go....I thought the best i can say for this book is it has a couple of moments that did entertain.
but all in all I found it very cartoon like and a bit soap opera like.
I mean Wulfgar!
on Ice?
seriously?
hey next time order a Wulfgar on ice.
mmm good!
not.so read this one for the sake of the good times of old and let's hope the next is a bit more....
Although I still liked the book, I'm starting to lose interest in the series. At this point I just want to say that I read all...30? 40? Rather than genuinely wanting to see what new challenge Drizzt and his friends overcome. We'll see how many more I can get through before it grabs me again like the first 6 did.I did enjoy the naval battles and journeys. It was a refreshing change of pace.Definitely saw the "big twist" coming a mile away.
Was anyone actually surprised that it was Wulfgar? I mean it would have been a much bigger shock if it had been Drizzt's father. Even without the barbarian subplot. I enjoyed most of the book except that part.
This long running series is really starting stagnate. The characters have been through the same dramas and plot devices before, but even more condemning, they are now beginning to irritate.
Not my favorite. What is it with some authors and the need to bring back the dead? There is nothing wrong with continuing a story without some character. Just move on already!
"Is this my home? I know not. Another stepping stone, I would guess, but whether there really is a road that would lead me to a place called home, I do not know" (9). My Rating 2 stars Book Series Book 10 of the Legend of Drizzt (30+ books). My Thoughts I don't like giving a Drizzt book this low of a rating, but this book was a dud for me. The beginning was painfully slow. Of course, Salvatore's books get more exciting as the story progresses, but this book pushed my patience. I skim-read 20 pag
I don't like giving a Drizzt book this low of a rating, but this book was a dud for me.
I skim-read 20 pages because I was so bored!The first third of the book is about Drizzt and Cattie-Brie on a pirate-hunter ship, and this ship that they're on goes on a wild goose chase in search of a legendary island.
The last third was probably the best (as is with most Salvatore books I've read).
I was pleasantly surprised by the last 10% of the book.
There are over 30 Drizzt books, and I think this one is a dud.
A bit of a return to form for the series after what I thought to be the overly long and uninteresting Siege of Darkness.
Good to be back on the road with Drizzt and friends.
I enjoy that it's basically guaranteed that everything will turn out okay and get wrapped up in the end in this series.
With all the grim-dark fantasy all over the place now, a fun, light-hearted adventure really does the trick sometimes.The seal thing is...kind of unforgivably bad though.
There are about 1000 other, better solutions to that problem that could have been employed here.
Some new, likable characters (Cadderky and Danica) and great interactions between the wizards on the ship (Robillard and Harkle), but the impossible odds that are always overcome get more ridiculous in each book. Worst of all, (view spoiler)[after having the courage to kill off Wulfgar and allow the relationship between Drizzt and Carrie-brie to begin to bud, it is unforgivable to bring him back from the dead (hide spoiler)].
The shard makes a comeback. Ruby pendant, khazid’ hea, the shard, icingdeath... so many sentient artifacts. It’s great to see the driving force of these. This book does a great job of taking you out to the sword coast and showing you adventure in the high seas. Island zombies, witches, demons, and the return of an old character which was very unexpected.
I'm not sure if it's just me but I'm starting to feel like these books are becoming a bit samey. This one in particular was very predictable. It is a good read, and I did find myself stuck to my book for the last few chapters, but I think I'll take a break for the series for a couple of months. Worth a read if you're a Drizzt fan
I did enjoy it. Not as much as when I was 17 , I used to be more naive and the characters seem very naive now that I have read it a second time. I do appreciate the adventure and my live for Drizzt has not diminished with age.
This says that it is the 4th book of the Legacy of the Drow but it takes place years after the battle at Mithril Hall and far away. Much seemed to be a rehash with Erttu and the Crystal Shard returning. Ok but hopefully the series picks up.
Hanging on the end of me chairOnce again Salvatore leaves me with the urge to skip writing a review so that I can get to the next installment of The Companions of the Hall. Never have I enjoyed a series more.
This is my second read of the series, to prep for the most recent release. Enjoyed the read, no different the 1st time through. I love the way Salvatore writes his action sequences, each will bring you to the edge of your seat.
Quickening reads--good story line, more insight into characters, progress to the Legend of Drizzt
Como siempre, Salvatore te traslada al mundo de Forgotem Realms y te sumerge en un mundo apasionante. Seguir a Drizzt es siempre un placer.
