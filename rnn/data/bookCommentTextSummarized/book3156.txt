The people, of course, were desperately poor, for the year had been one of the hardest the unfortunate country had ever known; a prolonged drought had been followed by terrible hailstorms on the very eve of harvesting; the price of corn was prohibitive, and the winter that ensued was so severe that even forest trees suffered from the frost.
Of course they were poor!
I have read The Scarlet Pimpernel and I liked it but I decided that I am not interested in other books of series.
I struggled with them.It wasn't a story about Scarlet Pimpernel, there was only a small connection to the series.
and then there was this!The story is framed by Sir Percy, who's supposedly telling it, but you never really feel his presence again till right at the end.Andre is a poor boy whose temper is often getting him in trouble with the higher-ups.
This aristocrat, de Marigny, is a pretty heartless guy, but he has a daughter who's really sweet, Aurore.
I sound sarcastic, but I really did just eat it up, it was a pretty compelling story of its type!
