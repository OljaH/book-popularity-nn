(A-) 84% | Very GoodNotes: James Bond teams with noble savages against aberrant hybrids: the trans-human recluse and his bi-racial henchmen.

James Bond, the monologuing evil mastermind bit is taken to almost comic proportions.
And so fun.** - I went back and watched the 1962 Terence Young film starring Sean Connery and Ursula Andress.
Great fun, surprised at many things: the low budget production that nonetheless holds up well, how beautiful was Andress and how young Connery.
After wandering around meeting the colorful locals (there will be something here to offend everyone, from the description of Jamaicans as "lazy children" to every single Chinese person being part of the Yellow Horde), Bond makes his way to Crab Key, an island owned by the mysterious Dr. Julius No. Dr.
You just know the ceiling lasers and submarine cars can't be far behind.Dr. No was still fun in all its racist, sexist, cheesy pulpiness, but it lacked the details and thin veneer of plausibility that earlier novels had, and boy has Fleming's writing gone downhill in this one.
Unfortunately, strict patterns of behaviour can be deadly if they are read by an enemy."- Ian Fleming, Dr. NoIt is weird to visit a book that is so well preserved by a film.
Maybe it was because it was the first James Bond film, but it has always stuck with me.
But, still, it was hard to read the book and not think of Ursula Andress, the very first Bond Girll on film, walking out of the ocean.
However, as I've aged, I seem to have gravitated more towards John Le Carré's view of the world and away from Ian Fleming's.
I'm kind of worried about what goes on in that brain of his...ANYWAY, we (the readers) know from the beginning that it's foul play - we witnessed the man and his female spy/secretary get murdered by "Chigroes" (black/Chinese) who then stole all the secrets and burnt the place up; all this is Chapter One.Bond reunites with Quarrel, his old friend from his adventures in LIVE AND LET DIE.
BY THE END OF THE BOOK, Bond loves her broken nose and is actually sad to think she might still want it fixed.
And yes, Fleming gets his facts wrong but he's not averse to making up for it: He has Bond change weapons and includes the weapons expert as a character (many thanks to Troy for pointing this out to me during our buddy read).He also puts forth some wrong facts about crabs, only to have Honeychile correct them later on in the story - I would not be surprised if he only learned about his error while writing the book and then chose to include the correction as a twist.Lastly, let's not forget about the villain of the piece: Dr. No.
Rating: 4* of fiveAgain rating the film from 1962.
And in so many ways, neither has the film.
Ursula Andress, the most-remembered woman in the cast, plays Honey Ryder (!), and she is the last of three women to find 32-year-old Connery irresistible.
Her emergence from the sea in what was for the day a teensy bikini, but for today's audiences might as well be a burqa, led to the current Bond iteration's scene with Halle Berry splashing up out of the sea in, basically, nothin' much.
How things have changed in 50 years.I found myself drooling over the decor.
3.5 stars ***2018 Summer of Spies*** Probably the silliest Bond that I have read so far, with Dr. No being a caricature of a villain, very over-the-top! Fleming must have read some of Sax Rohmer’s Dr. Fu Manchu, another super-villain of the early 20th century (and a character who drew protests from the Chinese embassy and Japanese-Americans for the overt racism).However, I’ve awarded half a star more than I did for the other Bond novels that I’ve read so far, both for the depiction of Jamaica (a
Fleming certainly gets the mangrove habitat and the guano business details right, probably as a result of his travel with two experts on this expedition.
Small islands are indeed a haven for colonies of sea birds and their guano has been exploited for fertilizer since the 1800s at least.I have to also acknowledge Fleming for being willing to change things up on the advice of experts—Bond gets new guns in this story, on the advice of a Bond enthusiast who was also a firearms expert (Geoffrey Boothroyd).
Ah, at last the bad guys are really starting to turn into the caricatures I know and love from their movie versions. Metal claws for hands is an awesome touch (no pun intended...well, maybe a little). Doctor No's overly detailed explanation of his operation, as well as his super elaborate method of execution is hilarious. The movies really took that aspect and ran with it. Kudos to them!
Even if we’re the ones that are supposed to have a good time, it sometimes feels like you’re punching a time clock and staring at a dark spot on the concrete wall while you bide your time waiting to make your grand exit from the funhouse.I’ve found I like myself better when I don’t read too many Bond books in a row, otherwise your Dr. Yes might turn into DR.
A piece of movie history I stumbled over yesterday.
They were doing the casting for Doctor No, the first Bond movie, and Julie Christie, who was just starting to get seriously famous, was suggested to play Honey Rider.
Albert Broccoli looked around for alternatives and noticed that Ursula Andress was also available.Now, if it had been me, I'm afraid I'd have picked Christie in a flash.
She was obviously a far better actress, and her rival also spoke with a thick Swiss-German accent.
But Broccoli saw more deeply into the situation: Andress had bigger breasts.
Entertaining book, if you can get by the casual of-its-era racism. Of all the Bond books I've read this one definitely made him seem the most vulnerable.
I know you’re happily surprised and relieved that no white beautiful people die in the making of this story.Things I liked/found amusing/interesting:*The story is pretty lively—it’s a thriller with fifties pulp foundations—silly, but at key points, especially 1) when we meet “the girl” and 2) when the action gets going, Fleming earns his money.*Dr. No is one of the most formidable of Bond nemeses, smart and powerful.
Yes!*The ludicrously named Honeychile Rider (okay, it’s not as ludicrous as Pussy Galore, but close) is of course supermodel-beautiful, whom Bond finds, conveniently, almost completely naked (she’s wearing a belt with a knife attached) (in the 1962 film Andress is wearing an almost chaste—by today’s standards—bikini) on a deserted beach.
I mean, I've started this project with my brother in which we're watching all of the James Bond movies in order, and then I'm reading the book of the same movie, after watching it.
(Yes, this means reading the books out of publication order, but I can't stress about everything.) So the first movie is Dr. No from 1962.
It's so 1962 it hurts at times.But in a lot of ways, the movie is toned down, Hollywood-ized, in comparison to the novel of 1958.
And somehow reading Bond's actions or thoughts or behaviors are even more ridiculous than watching them on the screen by Sean Connery.
In this installment Bond finds himself on a lazy vacation in Jamaica to mend from his last mission, or so M thought...
This may have been my least favorite installment so far.
The love interest genuinely made me uncomfortable.
Bond actually says that he views her as he would a child, and yet he wishes to bed her anyway.
I wish we could have had more of him in the book.
I would have loved to be shown more of how his mind works.
The trap in this book was as unique as its maker.
Again, I wish there was more of it.
After a long period of convalescence M decides that Bond is due for a "working vacation" in Jamaica to follow up on the disappearance of another operative, Commander John Strangeways, and his mistress.
The assumption is that Strangeways has run off with his beautiful assistant, but it's determined that Bond might as well look into it and get his feet wet again.
It's not long before Bond is captured on Dr. No's island, along with the beautiful Honeychile Rider.
Evil villain, dashing spy, beautiful woman, exotic setting, heat well and serve.
"Smith and Wesson ineffective against flamethrower." True.
But that doesn't prevent James Bond and Honeychile Rider from besting the mad and ruthless Dr. No.
Best to avoid the Bond series if you're squeamish about creepy, hairy, many-legged scritchy things like tarantulas, centipedes, crabs, and scorpions.
Also fearsome sea creatures like piranhas, giant squid, and octopi.
The bad guys always find diabolical uses for the uncute members of the animal kingdom.
Dr. No has a more comprehensible plot and and slightly more satisfying ending than the other two Bond novels I've read, so it gets an extra star.
The book is worse with a wafer thin espionage theme and an unimaginative mad scientist villian who is so dumb that untrained village belles can outwit him!Bond comes back after sick leave and agent M shows passive aggressive by taking away his favourite weapon and assigning him a 'vacation' assignment in Jamaica.
There he comes to know that the previous agent was investigation Crab Key island belonging to Dr.No before the secret office was abandoned.
The problems with the story is that there is no excitement despite the forced danger on the island.
Also, the Bond girl Honey has such a ridiculous back story that I was surprised this was made into a movie.

I've been reading the Bond books in order of publication (this is the sixth - though the first that I've written a review of on goodreads).It's certainly not the most exciting of the stories but, when you read it, you can understand the appeal of the story to filmmakers - Doctor No was the first of the Bond films.Basically, the plot goes as follows - British secret service man on Jamaica goes missing, Bond is sent out to investigate.
Turns out a maniac by the name of Doctor No runs on the island, and has predictable world-domination plans.
In fact, Bond really doesn't get his end away in the books anything like as often as in the films.
Fleming actually wrote things like "BLANK-" in the books, but if you are a creative potty mouth like myself you will chortle away as Bond say thing like "take that you flangewank" before shooting someone.
Doctor No is the first James Bond 007 novel I have read written by the original author, Ian Fleming.
You can find an often cranky interview Fleming had with Chandler on YouTube.
James is dispatched to Jamaica to deal with a minor problem of one of their colleagues having skipped off with his attractive assistant with no word.
Of course, things turn out more complicated once James arrives in Jamaica.
I may read further into Fleming's series at some point, but in the meantime I enjoyed taking this ride with him.
Who do evil villains spend so much time gloating -- especially when your audience consists of the resourceful and vengeful James Bond?
If I were an evil villain, I would calmly dock a large caliber bullet somewhere between 007's eyes.
And I would enjoy his girlfriend, the cute Honeychile Rider, before doing the same to her.I realize now why the Bond movies are so different from the books: Ian Fleming is writing for a pulp audience, so he could imagine sequences that no self-respecting film director would touch.
The James Bond literary franchise is a series of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer.
James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel Casino Royale; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964.
The original Dr. No novel diverges in some significant ways from the movie that kicked off the James Bond franchise.Bond, still recovering from a brush with mortality in his previous adventure, heads to Jamaica to look into the disappearance of the Head of Station, an old friend.
Fleming puts the star of his novel through a lot more physical torment than his movie counterpart endures (at least in that first incarnation of the franchise; the recent Daniel Craig movies are much more in the spirit of the source material).
While the celluloid Dr. No was the shimmering launch to a big ticket movie franchise, its novel counterpart falls in the middle of the Bond series.

Let's ignore that, this is of course the 6th book which became the first ever Bond movie and I remember watching the movie few years back and liked it good enough.
The issue is that even though these are smaller books nothing much happens in these, Also my God Bond drinks and smokes like anybody.
I like these good enough but none of the 6 books so far have gripped me completely.So have a wholesome fun and follow the Bond's journey with me and then Keep on Reading.
I am familiar with the story of Ian Flemings Doctor No through growing up with watching the James Bond films.
Since reading the book I can see some of the failings in the film and the way they dumbed down the character of Quarrel & Honey Ryder.
If you are familiar with the film, Quarrel is the gentleman that travelled to Crab Key with James Bond.
The book portrayed Quarrel as being more resourceful he was a more interesting character but the film did not reflect this.
