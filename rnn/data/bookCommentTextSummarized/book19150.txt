I'd contrast this with another favorite, Ilona Andrews, who had a clear arc for a seven-book series and a sense of where it was headed in both story and emotion.
Mercy will have asides in every book telling about her history, the fae reservation, werewolves, the wolves' coming out and her relationships with Samuel and Adam.
The exception to agency is Blood Bound, where the evil and conniving Marsilia engineers an elaborate trap, although clearly she still hates Mercy.
Patricia Briggs does not disappoint us in Silver Borne, the 5th book in her fabulous Mercy Thompson Series.  We continue following Mercy’s life and the world that she lives in…trouble always follows her as she throws herself into saving or helping her friends. This story goes deeper into the secretive and dark and dangerous fae world…. Mercy has something that the fae want back – a book she had borrowed from a fae friend, who is in danger because of that.

Patricia Briggs does not disappoint us in Silver Borne, the 5th book in her fabulous Mercy Thompson Series.
Mercy has something that the fae want back – a book she had borrowed from a fae friend, who is in danger because of that.
In between trying to find her fae friend, she another problem thrown at her by Adam’s wolf pack, who are most unhappy about her Adam making her part of his pact without their consent.
I love the chemistry between Adam and Mercy.
The world building and the characters are so well developed that makes it so real and believable.I just love this series.My favorite quote:
Still love ❤
Still love ❤️
I flew through this in 3 days! Love Adam - sigh!
It combines two or three plotlines:First, we have Mercy's ongoing issues with her failure to be fully accepted by her mate Adam's werewolf pack, which become Adam's issues.
So Mercy has three problems, all of which are hitting the boiling point.My favorite part of the book was the Sam/Samuel part; the werewolf politicking and fighting would have been more fun if it were more fresh.
The Silver Borne artifact part of the plot wasn't at all memorable.
Same old, same old. I love Mercy but these books are starting to show a clear pattern. I wish PB would shake up her plotlines a little with something (or someone) fresh.
I really enjoyed this book. My passion for this sub-genre has been waning because there has been SO much of it out there, but Mercy is one of the originals, and a really good heroine, working-class, compassionate and never perfect. I think I actually enjoyed this installment in the series better than the last, the characters were really fleshed out, the mystery was well-plotted. Nothing HUGE happens, but being comfortable with the world and the other characters is nothing to sniff at. Enjoyable, and all in all still one of my favorite Urban Fantasy series!
Maybe the author thinks everybody is sick of vampires.
I'm sick of the damned Fae. Their presence has ruined this series for me.
I've always liked Zee pretty well, but I disliked extremely the whole long sequence with the Fae towards the end of this book.
The previous book revolved around the Fae also, but at least it had a better overall plot than this one.I don't like that Briggs has made her werewolves have split personalities.
I felt unsatisfied and disappointed at the end of this book, and I won't be jumping to buy the next one as soon as it releases.
I still cry when I read a great many of Sam's storyline in this book.My one complaint, and overall it's fairly minor, and probably something we just didn't see the consequences of - is (view spoiler)[her taking Jesse into Elphame!
The Pack; Samuel, the fae - it's all perfect and heart-wrenching and suspenseful.
It makes it harder to separate everything out for me.Mercy's newly mated to Adam and brought into their pack.
I also liked that it wasn't dragged out for a long time (more than one book).The fae "mystery" story-line was probably the weakest.
I never get tired of this series!!! The introduction of coyote is like icing on the cake!!! 5 stars!!!
Another great instalment! This book involved the fae and the vamps didn't even get a bit part! It's interesting that when I read the first book in this series, I was almost put off continuing by all the werewolf politics. Here in book 5, there is a lot of werewolf politicking, but now that I'm happily ensconced in the series, it was interesting to read.
****Spoilers if you haven't read the previous books****Mercy navigates Pack dynamics and the animosity of some of the members.
Being a coyote brought into a werewolf Pack doesn't make several happy, but there are a couple unhappy for another reason.
Adam and Mercy's relationship strengthens in spite of some outside interference and I'm always impressed with the loyalty and love between them.
Samuel's mental condition takes a turn for the worse, but Mercy is a good friend and Adam is helpful with his support.
Mercy is also dragged into Fae issues, once again.Thoughts back in September 2013:So, so, so good!!
Love this series!
I love everything about this book!
Briggs is my drug of choice! I loved this book! It made me very glad that I had also read the Alpha and Omega series!
*** 4.10 ***  Another wondrous Mercy Thompson adventure and another book added to my "really pleasant read" shelf.
The power structure is shaky since Adam brought Mercy in and she took her place as the alpha's mate.
What would the other wolfpacks think???So, while it seems that the people who should have her back are doing everything but, and random Faes are also randomly targeting her with malicious intent, she is also faced with trying to find a reason for her best friend to stay alive...
We learn more about the Fae and pack politics, and we also see the growing devotion between Adam and Mercy.
Can Mercy help Samuel regain control before the other werewolves find out what has happened and what does the powerful fae want with the book?Although this review won't contain spoilers for Silver Borne as this is book 5 in the Mercy Thompson series it will be impossible to review without giving spoilers for previous books in the series.
Having come up against the fae before she is understandably wary when she finds herself being targeted again but she is determined to protect her friends and find out what is going on.My favorite part of this book has to be the interaction between Adam & Mercy, I just love them both as a couple & it is nice to watch their relationship develop since their mating in the last book.
I adored this installment of the Mercy series, and it is definitely one of my favorites.
Samuel has been on the back burner a bit since Mercy became Adam's mate and getting a peek into his very old mind and the strife he is dealing with was great.
Mercy herself grew a great deal in this book as well.
Yes, the solutions through out these books tend to be a bit convenient but are well thought through, developed, and make sense.
There was so much character development in this book, and a much clearer understanding of Mercy's interaction and place within the pack.
4.5 stars - great! This book was yet another winner for me in this series. I really loved it. I laughed a couple of times. . .I cried possibly a couple of times (but definitely after the end). :-)I wrote the first paragraph of this review immediately after finishing this book. Time is not doing it any favors. Had I written this review yesterday, after finishing it, it probably would have been a five-star story. Now, though? Now I'm thinking it was just 4.5-stars-great.The main reason for this d
Sure, Mercy is not the strongest of protagonists, but surely we could read about her getting into some other type of trouble?And I'm afraid that my feeling tired of the "thrall" storylines is now coloring my impression of this book.
I mentioned laughing out loud a couple of times.
:-)Here is what happens: (view spoiler)[Ariana shows Mercy and Adam what the book was hiding - the small silver bird from "Silver" - and.
No vampires at all were in this book, but Stefan was at least mentioned.
Mercy knows that if he doesn't come around quickly then it will be the end for Samuel so she wants to give him some time to sort things out.
There are also a few issues concerning the pack and Mercy's relationship with Adam.
Adam and Mercy do love each other and take some steps to get things worked out.My favorite parts of this book were the sections that dealt with the pack and Adam.
This is a series that really needs to be read in order since the character relationships are a large part of the story.
They must not let said fae queen (once called Daphne) get her hands on Silver Borne, a magical artifact of great power, crafted centuries ago by Ariana, under duress.
Secondary characters include Samuel (werewolf, Bran's eldest), Zee (powerful metal-work fae "gremlin" warrior disguised as old mechanic), Jessie (Adam's 17-year-old daughter), Ariana (a "good" fae), etc.
After so much worry -- thinking he'd lost Mercy several times -- Adam's wolf is finally content.
Even better, Mercy has learned to enjoy the sex, the mating bond, and the pack bonds.
"I thought you were dead," he said..."Stupid," I said. "As if I'd die without taking you with me."He smiled faintly. Mercy has grown on me throughout this series. She still isn't as much of a smartass as I would like, but she is becoming more and more fun as time goes on. In this book, she is dealing with Samuel's issues while trying to figure out where Phin, the bookstore owner, has gone. On top of that, she has Adam's pack messing with her because some of them are not happy with her status as
And, as usual, Mercy ends up dealing with bad guys, getting hurt, going off on her own, etc..etc...
I feel like the author has to make up reasons to get Adam out of the way for Mercy to go running off on an adventure without him every book because he would just take over and spoil everything.
I'm just saying...It is nice to see Samuel have a story, but he is in wolf form for much of the book and so we don't get to have him speaking - which is a bummer.
My reviews for these books are getting kind of repeatative, how many ways are there to say I LOVE THIS SERIES!
Mercy & Adam- I love that rather then them having an immediate love-you-till-you-die connection that it seems to have grown and in this book you really see how deep the bond between them is.
I love how Sam has developed from a possible love interest for Mercy to such a good friend and I can't wait to see how things pan out for him.3.
Mercy is the best type of heroine in that she's so atypical, it's impossible not to love her.
If I ever hand any doubts about their devotion or the strength of the mating bond between this unlikely duo, then all my questions were answered in Silver Borne.
Suffice it to say, this series is effing amazing.I'll end with a favorite quote from Adam to Mercy:"He sighed.
"I don't think an apology will do, Mercy.
And, under the circumstances, you wouldn't do anything differently, would you?""No.""And you shouldn't have to apologize for being right," he said with a sigh.
Posted on Under the CoversIt’s the return of the Fae in Silver-Borne!
Like I said before, I don’t usually like fae stories, but Briggs is always an exception.
With Mercy as the newest addition of the Columbia Basin Pack, she’s still getting used to having Adam inside her head with the bond and learning to deal with the other werewolves in the pack.
As a result, there’s trouble within the pack as members step out from the shadows and confront Mercy on this.
I’m sensing something here, but I don’t want to call on it just yet!
I absolutely love Patricia Briggs' writing, her Mercy Thompson series (and the Alpha & Omega books set in the same world) is one of my favourite urban fantasy series and I tend to reread it most years to get ready for the latest release.
I really like it but I think I might have to try and come up with a design with a Coyote paw print to match Mercy's tattoo next LOL.
On the other side Mercy's got a handful of wolves who've got no reason to love her, a powerful unidentified fae who wants something she's got, and a pack of demons riding her friend Samuel--all of whom prove darker than she at first thought.
But in the end it's up to Mercy to put the pieces together and beat the clock to save her friends and those who rely on her from their monsters--both the ones they can see and the ones they can't.I don't know what goes on in Ms. Briggs' head when she sits down to write a new installment in this excellent series, but what comes out is pure, unadulterated magic.
I love this series.
It didn't even register what she had done till I read this.This book specifically cleared up things about Samuel and it was a relief.And of course, most importantly, I love the humor-there's nothing more fun than a smart mouthed heroine!I'm going to put off reading the next one for as long as I can since I don't want to be done with the series so soon!
★★★★ (This is a review of the audiobook.) Lorelei King narrates this first person POV, and I think she just keeps getting better at speaking as our little coyote-shifter garage mechanic, Mercy. She has a lot of voices in this adventure, which concentrates on the fae – but, definitely not this kind of fae (view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] – plus werewolves (of course), and a (view spoiler)[witch; but, real b!tch-witch, rather than this kind of a witch (view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]

Nevertheless, Ms. King handles them all nicely.
5 "Traitors, Fae Magic & Self-Sacrifices" Stars for the story and narration!Wow, Patricia Briggs really outdoes herself in Silver Borne!
Moreover, its not just the fantasy that makes this 5th installment in the Mercy Thompson Series special, but also its attention to the romantic connections and its impact on the life circumstances of several of the key characters of this series.As always, Lorelei King does a fabulous job of bringing this unique, magical world to life!I can't wait to continue with both the Mercy Thompson and the Alpha & Omega Series!Source: Library Copy.
As always, I love Mercy and her world. This one is no exception. From tricky fae to sexy werewolves, Briggs' world never ceases to entertain.
