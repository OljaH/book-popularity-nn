Here is where Manly Hall is a true spiritual beacon to those disillusioned with the blind dogmatism of religion.
"Know Thyself" rings out from every page and Hall pulls on his exhaustive knowledge of the Occult and practically everything else to uncover who we really are.
To understand the scope of his philosophical understanding of the universe is to understand the vast grandeur of God and although I may in time forget every word I have read, I am left forever with a feeling that I glimpsed something TRUE...
Know yourself and read this book.
Great Alchemical prints reference book.
This is an erudite work on the body and its various organs from the occultist's viewpoint.The author being from an older generation, the book is immaculately well written.The esoteric material is derived from the works of alchemists/occultists/cabalists etc.,including Parecelsus, Vesalius (the father of modern anatomy)and Robert Fludd, from the Middle Ages or perhaps older as well as from ancient Hindu texts.
I found this material extremely dry and difficult to comprehend.
