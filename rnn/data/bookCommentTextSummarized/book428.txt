At least a little - I'm definitely not suggesting that you should read this book and then never pick up a Christie novel ever again, but if you find yourself in a situation where you're going to spend a month on a desert island and can only bring one book, and the only books you've been offered are from the Agatha Christie canon, you should pick this one.
The narrator, Dr. Sheppard, is in his garden when someone throws a vegetable marrow over the wall.

As in all of her cases involving Inspector Hercule Poirot, Christie unearths layer upon layer of the case, leaving her readers guessing until the very end.
This time, in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Christie leaves me hanging until her final paragraphs, creating a thrilling case.
To solve this particular crime involving blackmail, drugs, and forced marriages, Ackroyd's niece Flora turns to Hercule Poirot to get to the bottom of the murder.
Roger Ackroyd was definitely a captivating Christie case but not quite at the level for me as Orient Express was.
The Murder or Roger Ackroyd is one of the most well-known mysteries written by Agatha Christie and the only one to be featured in the 1001 Books To Read Before You Die list.
As with all her mysteries, it leaves you guessing until the end who the killers is and in this particular case, the way the murderer was unraveled was particularly interesting.
Sadly for me, I already knew who the killer was as I accidently found out from an audio course on Crime and mystery novels.
If you enjoy Agatha Christie’s novels this one is a must.
Agatha Christie had me from the first page, hook line & sinker and she never lost my attention until the very end.
If there are others out there, like me, who are late in the game of reading this I do not want to spoil that experience for them in any way.This is only the second Agatha Christie book I have read and my first Hercule Poirot.
I want to go back and read it again, just to see how many clues I missed along the way.
If you have not as yet taken the Agatha Christie plunge, look no further.
Agatha Christie offers her readers an invite, an invite to come and solve her tantalising murder mystery.It was a real tricky one, though I did have my suspicions very early on.
The actual murder event was ever so discreet, tucked in between two paragraphs in plain sight that will always be missed on an initial read.
Christie gives you just enough information to keep you second guessing yourself but not enough to finally confirm your suspicions, at least, until that memorable reveal: the grand unmasking of her killer.
This will not be the last Agatha Christie novel I read.
Nunca había leído a Agatha Christie, así que me puse a leer acerca de ella y review de sus obras par
لا شك أن هذه الرواية هي من أجمل وأغرب وأعقد ما قرأت لأجاثا...النهاية كانت صادمة وخارجة عن كل التوقعات , وكان التشويق سيد الموقف في كل صفحة من صفحات الروايةهذه الرواية إبداع حقيقي من السيدة أجاثا...أنصحكم بها يا أصدقاء..
My 2018 Review ooh 4.5 starsSo as part of my Hercule Poirot challenge, courtesy of Jessica in "Reading the Detectives", I decided to read this book for the 2nd time in 13 months (why when I have so many books I want to read I don't know, but I did).
Maybe a third time, but give me a few years.My 2017 Review 4 starsWhere to start, well I saw a few other people wanted to read this as a Buddy read, so whilst on a Miss Marple kick (challenge) I thought why not.
This Hercule Poirot is a genuine tour de force, a classic of the genre, for a very good reason that you will understand perfectly as soon as you have finish reading it.
I saw a few reviews, before I read this book, saying it was the best Agatha Christie they had read and I think I agree!
I raced through it in a few hours though still making sure I absorbed every fact and every clue.Not that it did me any good.
I had plenty of ideas as to who the murderer might be but in the end none of them were correct.
Poirot kept his secrets right to the end and only then did things become clear.
It was actually an amazing conclusion to a really excellent story.Thoroughly enjoyable and yes, one of the best Christie novels I have read.
My second thought was: "Agatha Christie understands evil in a way that is a little frightening!"This time through, I remembered how it turns out (which is not always the case!), and was able to watch the clues with the murderer in mind.
After you have read the book, you can read about it's reception on the Wikipedia page devoted to it, but there are numerous spoilers, so don't check it out until you are 'in the know':http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murd...Many consider this novel to be Agatha Christie's best, though I have also heard many votes for "And then there were none" (Originally published as "Ten Little Indians").
A mystery that lasts till the last page and ends with an unprecedented plot twist.One of the favorite books that I read in 2015. Nothing much can be said about the story or plot, or anything for that matter, without dropping a major spoiler. But trust me, it's bloody clever. Agatha Christie will leave you dazzled. One of her finest.Highly Recommended!
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd definitely my favorite Hercule Poiriot mystery(so far).
Agatha Christie once again leads readers to a small English community where EVERYONE has a motive and open windows and locked doors make this the kind of mystery that needs our favorite Belgian detective.
Our story is narrated by local doctor, Dr. James Sheppard who lives next to Poiriot and soon finds himself as the Watson to the Belgian's Holmes.
I do believe that A.C. might just have created my favorite literary character cast as I found each of them utterly delightful.
Although Caroline Sheppard is perhaps my favorite!

I feel like Agatha Christie is just very consistently good, but that might also be that I’m exclusively reading her books that have been recommended to me?
We know the beats of this story; we know that at the end, we’ll have a nice detective reveal, and it’s always fun to see more.I will say that this kind of made me want to punch Poirot in the face sometimes and I feel bad because I liked him so much in Murder on the Orient Express.
What I think is clever about this reveal is that once you figure it out, it’s a nice moment of going back over the book and realizing… wait.
Soo, I have heard a lot of wonderful things about this book and about this great ending. I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie stories and they are the "Perfect" cozy mysteries for me. Whenever I read a cozy mystery, I end up comparing it to Christie novels. My personal favorites are And Then There Were None , Murder on the Orient Express. If you haven't read these, go ahead and give them a try. So as this book is counted in top 1000 mystery books, I definitely wanted to be ahead of Christie or sho

Whenever I read a cozy mystery, I end up comparing it to Christie novels.
I started this book with determined air and put on my thinking cap with vigor.Was I able to guess the ending?
There were few smaller mysteries along the way and some of them I was able to guess correctly.I had a lot of theories and suspicions for the main ending but none of them came to be true.
Η αλήθεια είναι πως έχω συναντηθεί με την Αγκάθα Κρίστι και στο παρελθόν, αλλά μπορώ να πω, πως μόνο αυτές τις ημέρες την γνώρισα.
Όταν πριν λίγες μέρες έπεσε στα χέρια μου ένα βιβλίο της και δέχτηκα να το διαβάσω, έπαθα πλάκα.
Η Κρίστι είναι σαν την ηρωίνη, έτσι και πέσεις σε ένα βιβλίο της θα θες κι άλλο.
Όσα αστυνομικά και αν έχουν γραφτεί από τότε, αυτά θα παραμένουν αξεπέραστα και δύσκολα στην επίλυση τους, ενώ οι ατάκες της Αγκάθα θα συνεχίζουν να έχουν την ίδια ζωηράδα που είχαν και τότε.Τα αδίκησα, και καλά να πάθω που τόσα χρόνια δεν τα άγγιζα.
ما هذا بحق السماء ؟؟!!!!مما خلقت تلك الأجاثا !!!!
حسنا أصدقاء الجودريدز أنا هُزمت :D ..لا بل هزيمة منكرة والله :D ..شيء مؤسف أن تضيع كل المجهودات هباءا منثورا ..
ولكن من ذا الذي يتحدي تلك السيدة !!
ثم تصفعك علي وجهك بالنهايه .
شعور الغباء جميل بحق :D !
علي العموم لا أدري ما يقال في شيء كتب من ثمانين عاما بتلك الكيفية !!
لا أدري والله :) اذا لننسحب في هدوء ونضع تلك النجمات الخمسة ونلتزم الصمت .:D الي اللقاء في صدمة جديدة يا شباب..
Leída en dos sentadas, es una de las novelas de misterio que más me han gustado.
La verdad es que no es un género que lea normalmente, pero sí que me va conquistando poco a poco, y creo que es la novela justa para hacer que me enamore del género y continúe con él durante más tiempo.A Agatha Christie tan solo la había catado con Diez negritos, y pese a gustarme, eché en falta un final que cambiase completamente la historia.
Está claro que voy a seguir leyendo novelas de esta mujer.
Rating: 4* of five **THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT EPISODE AS WELL AS THE BOOK**The Publisher Says: In the village of King's Abbot, a widow's sudden suicide sparks rumors that she murdered her first husband, was being blackmailed, and was carrying on a secret affair with the wealthy Roger Ackroyd.
It's now up to the famous detective Hercule Poirot, who has retired to King's Abbot to garden, to solve the case of who killed Roger Ackroyd--a task in which he is aided by the village doctor and narrator, James Sheppard, and by Sheppard's ingenious sister, Caroline.The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is the book that made Agatha Christie a household name and launched her career as a perennial bestseller.
This is another brilliantly written murder mystery by Agatha Christie.
The plot is well structured and calculated with a mind blowing plot twist which will put you quite in a shock.
She has a great ability to lead on the plot without giving any hint or clue to who the guilty party is until the very end; and in this case, it was a shocking discovery.
This story too had an interesting set of characters.
And from what I have read of the Poirot series so far, this is where Poirot's brilliancy shines in its height.
It was an extremely interesting and intriguing read.
صفحة 327 كان رد فعلي زي الصورة اللي تحت دي حرفيًا وعارف إني مش لوحدي اللي عملت كدة :D الصراحة أنا مع
She got me! That cheeky beeotch! She got me!
Poirot, the famous Belgian detective immediately.
‘Ralph may be extravagant, but he's a dear boy, and has the nicest manners.’I wanted to tell Caroline that large numbers of murderers have had nice manners, but the presence of Flora restrained me.”Poirot agrees, of course, and nominates Dr. Shepphard as his chosen companion in the investigation, so that’s how we see the story unfold, through Dr. Shepphard’s telling.
This is near the end of the story and gives nothing away, except to show it is quintessential Christie/Poirot style."‘The number is complete', said Poirot.
You don’t need to have read any previous Poirot stories to enjoy this.

Remarkably, after only two novels, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, and The Murder on the Links, we find that Poirot has retired and taken a house, The Larches, in the fictional village of King's Abbot, near the home of his friend Roger Ackroyd.Unlike the previous Poirot outings, the narrator of this tale is village physician John Sheppard.
It is most definitely in Ackroy's back.The game is afoot when Ackroyd's niece Flora approaches Poirot to ask him find out who killed Roger Rabbit.
In 1990, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd came in at fifth place in The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a ranking by the members (all crime writers) of the Crime Writers' Association in Britain.
I guessed the murderer!
It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them. ♥💌Agatha Christie💌
