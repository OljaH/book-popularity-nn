The architecture of the room, indeed of reality itself, seems to bend and warp to center on the three young men, RAND, MAT, and PERRIN, sitting at the bar.)RANDWell, you two have to at least admit that Towers of Midnight is the most action-packed book in the whole series.MATNo question there.PERRINI won't argue the point.

All of these books are like best friends to me Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
*** 5+ ***A buddy read with my WoT family @ BB&B!!!
So close to the end...This was soooooo good!
I am left with no words which I have not used before, to praise this series, world, magic, characters, plot, writing, and pure genius of the author and the series creator!
Anything I attempt to say would only be useless fan-girling, so I am just going to repeat one thing - to all Fantasy fans, you have to read this series!!!
It is the one I consider as the standard all other series have to live up to!
I wish you all Happy Reading and many wonderful books to come!!!

It is so easy to get caught up in the happenings of this familiar world and its massive cast of characters really do feel like old friends by this stage!
Mat: I still feel like he is the character that suffers most in the change from Jordan to Sanderson.
I feel like Sanderson misread her in much the same way he did with Mat. She was used as a comedy relief character, which did provide some amusing moments, but that was definitely to her detriment.
I'm just sad we only have one more book to go as I feel like this world still has another 20 books worth of great stories in it!Rating: 4.5 stars.
January Read With the Fantasy Fanatics of  Since I started this series people have asked me if it was worth it. I mean there are a lot of books and they are all in the 750-1150 page range. This series is no small undertaking an in the middle when I was reading books 7-10 I really wondered if it was worth it. The worldbuilding is fantastic and complex but it really didn’t seem like anything was happening at all. But then we hit books 11, 12 and now 13 and I can say without a doubt that unless boo
This series is no small undertaking an in the middle when I was reading books 7-10 I really wondered if it was worth it.
I have waited for him so long and now we have someone to really root for in the big battle against The Dark One. I adored Rand in this book he has finally come into his hero role and he is finally a man worth following.
(hide spoiler)] I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again I really I just think of him as a sperm donor for that lovely lesbian couple that is Elayne and Avienda.Nynaeve was fantastic yet again in this book.
Part of me wants to hurry up and read the last instalment, to see how it all ends and whether the light will win and who will survive.
I will miss the characters, the banter, the adventures, the silliness, even the moments when I wanted to strangle the idiots.
With only one book left to go and so many unanswered questions I'm extremely excited and more than a bit apprehensive of the end to come.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
There are seemingly endless stretches where Jordan would devote a page or two to an Aes Sedai raising an eyebrow -- or worse, almost raising an eyebrow.On top of that, the emotional range of the characters has expanded greatly.
And they also leave me wondering how cool the series might have been if Jordan had focused on bringing about these changes, instead of either ignoring the issue or having the characters cling to their states of denial.
A central idea of the series is that Rand Mat and Perrin are ta'varen.
I just finished reading this one and cannot recall any event of some significance whatsoever.The first chapter returns to POV of a lowly and completely irrelevant farmer who provided a ride to Rand and Mat in the first book of the series and promptly went to oblivion since then.
Now that I finished the second Sanderson's entry of the series I am sure the promise was quite realistic: the first half of this novel does not have any excuse for its existence and could be removed from the final edition without any loss whatsoever.The second part starts with some very exciting and ultimately satisfying action from Mat. Unfortunately as soon as it stops, so does the plot movement.
I'm about a third of the way through this book and I've got to say that while there are some wonderful moments, Sanderson is carrying on Jordan's tradition of beating a subject or plot point not only to death but till it falls apart and starts to stink!I am heartily sick to death of Perrin's self flagellation and flat refusal to accept ANY reality...after 10,000 pages don't you think we can please, please stop going over and over and over the same ground!
This is the penultimate book in the Wheel of Time and it is excellent.
All of the characters are starting to come together for the Last Battle and they are all developing into rational thinking beings at last.
(Actually Elayne still is painful but there is hope for her yet.) Brandon Sanderson has done an excellent job here of taking over the writing from Robert Jordan.
The style is similar enough for continuity but more exciting and page turning than Jordan's.
I don't think I can resist going straight on to the final book.
I love both Jordan and Sanderson as writers, and I am so happy that Sanderson was the one chosen to finish this off because he's incredible when it comes to bringing all of the plotlines back together and making them all fit into place and all the characters begin their final journeys.This book really felt to me a lot like it was Perrin's book.
Characters are finally coming into their own, and showing real growth rather than the stale stubbornness that was becoming the hallmark of Jordan's last releases.It's difficult to write in enough depth about this book to make a good review, because so many of the elements that make this book good are inherently spoilers.
Rest assured, however, that I can, once again, heartily recommend Robert Jordan's series without reservations.
These books have saved the series from irrelevance, and have solidified these books, once again, as the sole, unquestioned best epic fantasy series available.
Oh god, half of this book must have been devoted to Perrin.
Totally random and failed attempt to do something exciting.Nothing happens in this book.
This one is pure drivel.The way Egwene defeated Mesaana was pathetic.
Like Elayne's failed attempt to pretend to be Mesaana or whatever.
That was idiotically stupid.Also, we barely get into the minds of any of the Forsaken this time around, except for short random blurbs from Graendal.Similarly, only one chapter with a non-Egwene Aes Sedai.Mat's trip to the tower?
Half a chapter.And GOD DAMN IT PERRIN SHUT UP.
It felt like Robert Jordan had lost control a bit and the story had started to wander in so many different directions that it took away from the main story line but that has improved so much since Brandon Sanderson took over and I think his books have probably been my favourite books of the series (certainly of the later ones anyway).The pace is so much better now, he's tightened up the plot and is focused on the main characters we've been following since the beginning.
They were so horrible that they manage to make me hate a show I actually liked a lot!
They grab awesome characters that I loved and put em in retarded situations that had nothing to do with the actual original plot of the show!
I think I have like 1 friend on my friend list who knows what a filler episode is!
But after a while started to write stuff just to get the votes… yes this is a better way to express what I think I’m trying to say here!
Like Matt being actually funny, and some good fast paced battle scenes… but then fillers!
It's just that I read A LOT of pages in a matter of days, and A LOT of things happened in those pages.Notably: the redemption of Perrin and Faile.
He doesn't just do it for Perrin and Faile, though, but for pretty much every remaining character, who all need to be in relatively good places leading up The Last Battle.
He seems like he's grown up (probably helps that he has 400 years of memories now).My only real complaint, besides the amount of time needed to redeem Perrin as a character, is that there wasn't enough Mat. Going in to the book, I was by far the most interested in his storyline.
I like the series, but I won't read large paper novels anymore.
I simply don't have the space or the wrist strength for it.11/20 - Found the hardback in a used book store.
Tor will NOT have my money twice (and maybe not at all), and I don't want to support the hardback format.
This is going to take a while...11/28 - Finished!
It's one of my favorites in the series, right behind Book 1.
Thank God Sanderson is finishing this and not Jordan!Mat's back to his old lovable self.
Rand stopped acting like a child and grew up.
But no--that's for the next book.The scene at Tar Valon well encapsulates what has been wrong with these books for a while: we know that something is going to happen, but instead of getting to it in some interesting way, the characters talk about it a lot, and then a bunch of minor things happen before we get to the important bit.
Sanderson has now twice managed to create individual plots for his characters.Rejoice, these are conflicts that will find resolutions.Perrin is fighting white cloaks and evading a Forsaken.
Of course, there are a couple plots that are not resolved, including the Black Tower corruption, Rand's quest, Lan's quest, and Aviendha's quest.But 2:1 ratio of resolutions to ongoing conflict is still a pretty good for a "Wheel of Time" novel.How are our favorite characters doing now that they've been away from home for thirteen novels?Well, Rand is pretty zen now.
Yet, even in those books where I name called Jordan a cash cow, this world was one I wanted to delve into with no interruptions.
I'm enjoying these more than the last several by Jordan!My biggest quibble with The Gathering Storm was that Sanderson hadn't captured Mat, and he's come a lot closer this time.And I just love what he's done with Rand, who I was actively disliking before Sanderson picked up the reins.
If I knew 13 years ago what I know now, I probably would never have begun reading the Wheel of Time series.It's really fun.
I don't really have much more motivation to read the series anymore beyond the fact that I'm committed to it.This book was fun.
Some exciting things happened that we've been waiting for for a long time.
I didn't think it helped the pacing.
It just brought me to the brink of utter despair wondering if it was ever going to end.I plan to read the final book when it is published next year.
I've read the entire series to myself.
E ovako se pise. Bravo Sandersone. Hvala Dzordanu na ovom grandioznom serijalu i na svim idejama koje su sve lucidnije kako se kraj primice.
I had to remind myself that I really did want to see what was in store for Perrin and Mat, and I could be patient for the rest.So where The Gathering Storm focused primarily on wrapping up Egwene's threads and furthering Rand's, Towers of Midnight wraps up Perrin and Mat quite nicely, while still leaving them enough to do in the last book.
Perrin does catch up eventually, but it could be a bit confusing at times.One aspect that I found different in this book is that the characters don't all have the same goals, priorities, or views on what needs to happen.
I can't see how Mr. Jordan could afford to tie all the strings together in just one book, keeping in mind the events that take place in the Gathering Storm and the Towers of Midnight.
Also, after creating hype about it from the last 2 books, the events in Tower of Ghenjei left me thinking that this should have been more difficult and time taking.Rand has become this powerful entity who dominates the creation itself with his presence.
The star of the last book, Egwene al'Vere is back to being herself, thinking she knows the best.
Don't send the mob to my house but... I think it was best for Jordan to go off and die before finishing this series. The series as a whole started off great, but somewhere around book five it went stagnant. Part of the problem was Jordan was dragging his feet the second problem was there was no character maturing. All the main characters continued to act like they did in the start of the series. Sanderson turns this around with a flare of despair. The characters mature and the story line moves forward again.
Certainly, I teared up many times over the course of this book because it had begun to settle on me that the adventures were ending, that we are approaching the finale of this series.
Also, Morgase x Tallanvor confirmed.It was about time also that the whole Whitecloaks chasing Perrin around storyline was finally resolved because its almost too stupid beyond words how long it has gone to begin with.
The pivotal Magnificent characters Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, Thom, Moiraine, and Lan. How far we have come.*SIDE NOTE: AGAIN!
Win. So much win. SO MUCH WIN.Every single word was magic. From the beginning of the prologue to the ending of the epilogue.Perrin redeemed himself. Bloody gorgeous, his POV chapters were. Mat was a different type of funny, all for the better. And Rand? Bloody brilliant. From the very first chapter. Beautiful.This was one of the best reading experiences this year. Right up there on par with Stormlight Archive. If the last book is as good, I am very very glad I picked up this series.Take all my stars. The fusion of Jordan and Sanderson is heavenly.
Towers of MidnightBook 13 of The Wheel of TimeBy Robert Jordan and Brandon SandersonA Wheel of Time Retrospective by Eric AllenJust a mere year after the release of The Gathering Storm Wheel of Time fans were treated to the next book.
Which is especially impressive, considering he also published a thousand page book of his own within months of this one.Towers of Midnight does some rather strange things with timelines, which caused a lot of people to complain and attack Sanderson.
Executive Summary: While I feel like The Gathering Storm moved at a rapid pace, this one suffered a little bit from moving some pieces around, but nothing like the middle books of the series, and the end was fantastic.Audiobook: Another fantastic job by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. They're what's made this reread not only possible for me, but even more enjoyable. Full Review During my original read of this series, I found this book to be the weakest of those written by Brandon Sanderson. Tha
Perrin was my favorite character for most of the early books on my original read, and this book finally brings his storyline back to a really enjoyable place for me.The other major, highlight was Mat's story.
Mat became my favorite later on in the series, and has remained so throughout my entire reread.
I've been eagerly awaiting the events of this book since I first started my reread a year ago.But Mat and Perrin weren't all I enjoyed here.
