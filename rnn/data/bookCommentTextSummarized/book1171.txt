Right?Her next door neighbor, a young woman named Mary Amber, helps her prepare the feast but she's not so sure Marilla's company is coming.
And when Aunt Marilla goes out to the street to receive a telegram that her nephew is not coming, she's crushed...until she spies a discouraged soldier walking aimlessly down the street and invites him instead.
When Mary Amber discovers a part of the telegram that tells her this is not Dick, and thinks he's scamming Aunt Marilla, she gets really nasty, confirming everything Lyman now thinks about women.
Funny how I remember this book so vividly from so many years ago.
Here we have the besotted aunt, who cannot wait for her nephew to come back from the war, so that she can do a little matchmaking with her sweet next door neighbor, Mary Amber.
Of course Mary Amber spots the deception but puts another spin on things entirely.
Lots of misunderstanding ensue.I love this book, and always have.
It's a sweet parable that really gives you something to think about how we treat those around us.
And it's so short, it's the perfect read when you just have a little bit of time.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*“The Big Blue Soldier” by Grace Livingston Hill“Aunt Marilla Chadwick wants to find a young man for her lovely young friend, Mary Amber.
A young man is returning from the war, very discontent and weary because of some of the injustices that have been done to him while he was away fighting for our country.
A lonely old spinster, Miss Miralla, and her next-door neighbor, Mary Amber, minister to this young man’s needs through a delicious home cooked meal and constant servings of homeopathic remedies when he becomes gravely ill.
I like the fact that GLH isn’t afraid to use unusual words, thus building my vocabulary, and that I don’t have to wade through a lot of curse words or explicit sex scenes just to enjoy a good book.
This is shorter than most of her stories. Cute, simple romance.
Just one of the many Grace Livingston Hill books that I ALWAYS LOVE.
A really quick read by Grace Livingston Hill about a down and out soldier taking the place of a preoccupied rotten nephew and the neighbor girl who tries to hide that she knows about the duplicity.
Sweet, fluffy, harmless.
Not one of her best
