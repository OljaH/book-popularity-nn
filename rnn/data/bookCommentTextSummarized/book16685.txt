This book has it all!
Magicians, demons, serpent-people, elves, Dragon Lords, dwarves, alternate dimensions, magical portals, romance, deception, revenge, sea battles, mountain battles, battles of wit, fire oil, catapults, flaming moats, political intrigue, and even evil cannibals!Sometimes I have seen where people say that Feist's series starts losing some steam around this point, but this was an action packed climax for the Serpentwar Saga.
In fact, a lot of that plot that seemed finished comes back for further resolution in this book.

I know, the idea is to hold the enemy at Nightmare Ridge; but it just feels like the person writing the account of one of the most important events in Midkemian history was perhaps looking the other way when it happened.And this is where I'm going to go slightly off range.
It's like Feist was actually there, writing this book on the back of one of Roo's wagons, as the enemy chased them.
In recent books, Feist has taken the piss with convenience characters like Nakor, who once again here produces a codex that handily explains everything for everyone.
These books aren't without faults and/or minor annoyances, but I still enjoy them and seem to have become invested in making my way through all of these linked series' ....eventually. Of the serpentwar saga, so far I've enjoyed this one the most. But Silverthorn is still at the top of my list overall.
Rage of a demon king is the third book in the 'Serpentwar Saga' and it takes the reader on a thrilling & exciting journey to Midkemia.
This is by far one of my favourite books by Raymond, as it is full of compelling drama, non-stop exciting action & brilliant iconic characters that bring this story to life.
If you enjoy compelling and exciting fantasy fiction then Raymond E Feist is masterful & completely brilliant in this genre, so i urge that you take a look.
The Demon Queen's hordes have landed and the plans for the defence of the kingdom move swiftly.
But Pug the magician and his friends begin to realise that something doesn't quite add up.
Why is the Demon Queen so intent on reaching the fabled Sethanon?
And while they struggle with the big picture, Eric struggles with falling in love and being raised high in the military ranks, a whole kingdom to defend with the bodies of his men.
And Roo, a trading Empire crumbling around him, realises that maybe its his family that are more important after all.Another great story.
Third book in Serpentwar series combines everything you need from fantasy - good story with twists, magic, epic battles and romance. Best in the series so far :)
This is basically the climax of two books of buildup in the Serpentwar series: the long-feared massive army finally arrives for a colossal invasion.Though the army in question includes hundreds of thousands of people, almost none of them are actual characters.
The struggle against overwhelming force is fun enough to read: the heroes have prepared for this for two and a half books before it arrives, and use both cleverness and determination to hold the day.
But I can't help but feel that a massive war like this would have been more interesting portrayed as a struggle between two different groups of people, with their own motivations, even if one was more evil than the other.
Rage of a Demon King's chief focus is on the war effort between the Kingdom and the vast, invading army of the Emerald Queen.
Despite the emphasis on action, Rage of a Demon King at times struggles for impetus, and for its own identity within the series as a whole.
Feist's characters are always easy to get behind though, with a plethora of likable protagonists and Midkemia's always-evocative locations making for an enjoyable read that thankfully avoids the hyperbole of many modern fantasy titles.
I really don't like Roo's character and considering book 2 was all about him I guess that played a part.
This being the 11th book I've read by Feist, I can say he still has major issues with characters that don't have any depth or purpose in the plot but there was a large improvement in this novel.I was so relieved that Roo had his comeuppance with Sylvia, even though his emotional reaction to it was nonexistant.
character development in a Feist novel!
My favourite was the invasion and battle scenes, they were nicely staged and I was able to imagine them easily.
And of course the demon boss battle.
Book 3 in the Serpent War Saga sees battle joined between the army of the Emerald Queen the forces of Krondor. In this instalment much of the political threads of the previous two books are put aside for battle after battle as the inferior numbers of the defenders attempt to hold back the large hoard of attackers. In parallel to this the wizard Pug and Miranda are joined by Marcos (who wasn’t dead after all) and try to find out what is really behind the struggle and to deal with it. The two dif
Book 3 in the Serpent War Saga sees battle joined between the army of the Emerald Queen the forces of Krondor.
The two different strands face many trials and battles but none will prove as tough as Erik’s as he returns home and comes face to face with the Von Markmoor matriarch who has already sent assassins after him.
As the battles rage many fall by the wayside including some well-loved characters.
This was a real page turner with the tide of the battles turning first one way and then the other.
Interested to see how Feist concludes this four book storyline of the wider Rift War Saga.
Much more action than the previous book, and much better balance between the characters and storylines.
There's still some stuff about the gods that I don't fully understand, but I suppose there is more to come on that in future books.A few annoyances:-Can we have more interaction from the dwarves and elves?
I was expecting some dwarvish action that was hinted on early, but it never really came.-If the whole of Midkemia was really going to be devoured and destroyed, why is it that the Kingdom, and specifically the humans in the Kingdom, are the only ones who have to fight the foe?
At least a heads up that they would probably be destroyed if the enemy succeeds.
This one had a better pacing than 1 & 2 and for me was more interesting.
I find Roo and Eric boring so far, though at this point it is through their backgrounds and on to their parts in the war which are more interesting.
There is also more about all the previous characters and descendants.
This series is a part of a much bigger series and so far has been a very long and winding road.
New characters over every turn with a few recurring.
Everything connects and winds together.

This is an epic series so you expect characters to die and family members, grand children, to carry the mantle. In saying that, there are a few deaths here that are so hard to take that I actually had serious tears. They were so artfully done that I can forgive and understand but ouch, they hurt.I adore this series and have to say that you aren't fully a lover of the fantasy genre if you haven't read Feist.
War is coming. The serpent priests and various demons from another dimension are heading to the kingdom and so they need to prepare. We follow some of our favourite characters, who all seem to have remarkable aging properties, as they prepare for an invasion, and our disloyal friend Rupert as he continues to make great wads of money but then has to give it up for the war effort.Really good fun, and the descriptions of the invasion as it progresses are good stuff.
I enjoyed this book, thinking it one of the better of the most recent few of the series. However the ending was a big disappointment. In order to set up for the next book the the most powerful heroes of the book had to suddenly and incomprehensibly become nearly useless, weaklings with no imagination. It's pretty frustrating to see an author dull and twist characters in order to manhandle the story to set up for the next book. It just felt unnatural and unauthentic.
Third volume of a four-book series, this novel is basically one long battle with some progress with Roo's and Erik's individual stories. Revelations and intrigue abound with some further character development.It's worth reading the previous two volumes to fully comprehend what this book is about and, although not a great fan of books about battles and fighting, I found it important to see it through to the end (640 pages plus). The fourth part awaits.
Well worth getting read.You are left on edge as you read it and wonder what happens next, but you think you know but you are wrong. He always finds a way to leads in a different direction, the book is well worth it.
Another great epic tale of heros and villians, as Krondar prepares for the coming invasion. Almost everyone plays a part in this story. I read the e-book version and there were a few editing issues, but overall a great read.
Too much happening to too many un-charismatic characters whom I could only muster some empathy towards one or two and whos deaths only touched me a little, and still I continue to explore
The saga continues as does the devastation of war. #3 has everything a good story needs, plenty of action, demons, magic, Elves, and Dwarves.
Hooray! After the disappointing book 2 of the Serpentwar Saga, Feist returns to the style and characters that I love his writing for.
BEWARE: epilogue is at the beginning!Great book but the Kindle version has the epilogue immediately after the prologue. Spoilers! I knew the end before I even started!
This series just gets better and better (like Nakor). The number of pages in the goodreads entry is incorrect (there are 642).
The payoffs are getting powerful!
This is not the edition I read. Need to correct details: --> J'ai Lu
And I hope he gets back to mercantile deviousness in Shards of a Broken Crown.What I enjoyed about this book is that while the focus is clearly on the powerful and great of the land doing heroic doings to 'Save the World'��™, Feist also shows us the effect on the little people, those forced to leave their homes and goods behind, just to stay alive and the regular troops, who follow orders and end up far from home not even sure what they are fighting for.
Both entertaining, well-written novels, with nice twists and turns around every corner, but nothing compared to Rage of A Demon King, where Feist puts everything together.
The story is told from all sorts of different views: we have Pug, the greatest magician the Kingdom has ever known, who is now on a quest to find Macros The Black, Eric who is trying the best he can to keep the enemy army at bay, Rupert Avery who single-handedly supports this war when it comes to money, and the entire royal family – William, Arutha, Prince Patrick and Robert -, most of whom are constantly wondering how they can prevent the war, or atleast make it less bloody.
So this was the third book out of six... and this book was just confusing and I really couldn't grip what the book was about. I hope the fourth book is better :)
