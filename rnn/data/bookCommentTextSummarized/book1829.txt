More importantly, the story highlights the decline of Roman morals during the beginning of the Late Republic; the transition into a monarchy was starting to take place, and Sallust shows us how corrupt Rome had become even at this early period.
It also highlights the early careers of Caius Marius and Cornellius Sulla, two Romans who began a private feud during this war, and who later dragged it into state politics, helping to usher in Rome's first Civil War.The Cataline Conspiracy-This takes place a generation after the Jugurthine War, when Roman politics has reached a new pitch of excitement.
This edition contains the War with Cataline; the War with Jugurtha; six orations and speeches from Sallust’s fragmentary Histories, and several pseudo-Sallustian works appended to the end.
If that were so, we should have a much fairer state than theirs, since we have a greater number of citizens and allies than they possessed…But there were other qualities which made them great, which we do not possess at all: efficiency at home, a just rule abroad, in counsel an independent spirit free from guilt and passion.
We make no distinction between good men and bad, and ambition appropriates all the prizes of merit.” (War with Cataline, 19-23) I wish I had paid closer attention the first time I read this as a Classics major.
Sallust himself pointed out that Romans as a culture were disinclined to produce brilliant historians, and unfortunately in his case it may be true. The writing is only at times riveting or poetic. On the other hand he is writing fairly close to contemporaneously to the events he studies in the case of the Cataline conspiracy and withing living memory with his work covering some of the African wars. If you consider this a frank and fairly detailed long-form journalism rather than a literary pleasure in itself, you will not be disappointed. It is worth a look.
