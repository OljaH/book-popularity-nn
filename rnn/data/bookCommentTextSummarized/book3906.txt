“The finest of all works touching on eroticism.” –  Albert Camus Presumably the character of Irene was inspired by Louis Aragón’s passion for  Nancy Cunard  who was his mistress at the time he wrote the novelette and whom, earlier,  Aldous Huxley  turned into Myra Viveash in his effervescent  Antic Hay .The tale is something between a recollection, reverie or daydream.To sleep, to dream…Already a fine sweat beads the flesh at the horizon of my desires. Already the canvas of the spasm appear in t
They have walked, those travelers, carrying gunpowder in flasks and shoddy wares in crates with rusty nails, from towns of terraces and long paths of water damned by black docks.
The mirage appears, and its beautiful fountains… The mirage is sitting naked in the pure wind.
A beautiful mirage of man entering the quim.
A beautiful mirage strong-limbed like a pile driver.
A beautiful mirage of springs and heavy melting fruit.
Irene is like an arch above the sea.Irene's Cunt, despite its ostentatiously shocking title, isn’t dirty or vulgar – it is rather poetic than pornographic.And although Louis Aragón in his later years repudiated the novelette, it remains one of the key texts of the entire surrealistic movement.The erotic idea is the worst mirror.
its such a moving story about irene and her best friend, her c**t. Biten by a radioactive spider her c**t comes to life in this hillarious and tragic holocaust black comedy romantic drama.
It's just such a great title. Who cares about the content? Oh if you must. It's like this lost surrealist masterpiece by Aragon who was a tortured kind of guy. If only I had been around then. Modern guys are just so fucked up. Irene has apparently a nice c##t. Well so have I. Nobody ever wrote a book about it. Just about sums up why I left England.
Some other reviewers gave the basics, a paraplegic man is used as captive audience by his wife and daughter who engage in a range of perversions with farm hands.The real story is his increasing enjoyment of these supposed 'tortures', his growing sense that he holds the reigns of power, a shifting of erotic sensation onto the changing colors and smells of the seasons, and finally his ascent into "the blue kingdom of the flies", a godlike psychic state.
The final chapters are luminous and morse-code-like, signalling a new reality.
Aragon used a pornographic setting as the most suitable jumping off point to this erotic-spiritual epiphany.
The French have a way with things we won't even talk about.
Escrito como los dioses, con una furia y un ritmo de poesía que se lleva todo puesto. Te obliga a leer cada vez más rápido, y a detenerte en cada metáfora. No hay ni una página que no sea sublime. No exagero: Cortina, suspiras como un seno. Se diría la proximidad del amor. Cuando una inminente tormenta hace rodar ya en el oscuro escenario de las nubes sus poderosos hombros de luchador, cuando una tormenta pesa sobre una región oprimida donde el malestar se despereza en las casas aisladas que pre
Escrito como los dioses, con una furia y un ritmo de poesía que se lleva todo puesto.
No hay ni una página que no sea sublime.
Cortina, suspiras como un seno.
Dicen que hay que cerrar puertas y ventanas cuando se acerca una tormenta.
θα μπορούσα να διαβάζω αραγκόν αιώνια ακόμα κι αν δεν είχε γράψει ούτε μία λέξη.
Beautiful and strange. Eroticism, obsession, imagination and the abyss. True to surrealism in its dream-states (it begins, 'Don't wake me, for God's sake...') and its depictions of flesh, from poetic admiration to the grotesque. And outside-inside, inside-out. In one part, an invalid's sex life lives only (but vividly and even gleefully) inside his head. Camus liked it. I did too.
Don't remember this at all. No doubt I read it b/c it was porn written by a Surrealist. The back cover tells me that it's about a paralyzed old man who gets his sexual experience by watching other people have sex thru peepholes. The real translation of the original French title wd be "Irene's Cunt" but Grove probably cdn't get away w/ that at the time.
I make no apologies.The story is told by a man who seems to have given up on life.
Even these things seems to bore him, and eventually he holes up in his room and withdraws into a fantasy world in which writes and creates the story about a powerful family who operate a large farm.
He sits helpless and drooling but revels in his own mental interior life, seeing and imagining the sexual exploits of his wife, his daughter Victoire and his granddaughter, Irene.
Later the story perspective shifts back to the main narrator, the original man, the loner/writer, who begins to describe Victoire and Irene, mother and daughter.
i requested this book through interlibrary loan and i was v embarrassed to receive it from the librarian. she made me say the title of the book into the loudspeaker and everyone in the library gave me looks of judgement. it was worth it though because i enjoyed reading irene's juicy taco with my gay boyfriend. im a noob but i would say if u enjoy lautreamont or story of the eye, you'll find this book worth reading, and worth being humiliated by your librarian
A surrealist text that opens up with stream-of-consciousness word play that transitions into an actual narrative.
I believe the gist of the story revolves around the syphylitic paralyzed old man, his daughter Victoire, and his grandaughter Irene.
I believe the brothel scenes imply how the old man contracted syphilis.
It not is not quite as shocking as Story of the Eye but I found it profoundly more sad: the paralyzed old man is teased and things are done in front of him as if he is not even a human.
His own daughter grows to hate him and he ends up lusting after Irene.
Jestli jste alespoň jednou v životě milovali nebuďte mě jestli jste milovali!
It is a strange mix of surrealism, art, autobiography and rather sexually explicit with little developed story – Albert Camus apparently liked the novella.
Really the most shocking thing about this book was its title but the actual novel itself was pretty sedate. There's nothing in here much worse than Henry Miller and even though it's labeled as "Surrealist Erotica" on the back I didn't feel it was "surreal" at all. But maybe I'm looking at it through a 21st century POV instead of 1928, when this was published. Aragon was one of the founding members of Surrealism but that doesn't make this book surrealist. It was a decent short read, but pretty much a sidenote to his more important work.
Despite the somewhat shocking title, this is acompelling and brief novel of delicate and lyrical eroticism. A similar theme of a man afflicted with paresis is in Hamsun's Hunger- who becomes a voyeur to his family . While it has a dreamy quality to it, I do not consider this a surrealistic story,
dear mr. aragon,forgive me to write you a few lines.paris peasant was so much fun.and irene's c**t just wasn't.to state it bluntly.the french are famous for oh la la.and you spoiled it.why? if a girl let you down,don't be angry! it's a gameremember.so give it an other try.
My edition included "The Adventures of Jean-Fuck the Cock" (I may have liked it more than Irene's Cunt) and some very NSFW art by Andre Masson.
معرفش العيب فيا أو فى الكتاب بس أنا مفهمتش أى حاجة خاااالص
With Irene's Cunt, fierce in passion, implicitly critical, and anonymous, he was partly breaking free of the movement.
Irene's Cunt is not quite a manifesto, it is very short, a fragment of a longer text.
The 100 pages are composite and entertaining in form.
I really appreciated the density of the text, its sensual rush, its powerful poetical moments.
The couple pages of the ode to the female sex are maybe the best here, but the other chapters are also enjoyable, not so much for the story they hint at but for their stylish erotic tension.
The introduction touted this as a sort of companion to Story of the Eye, but in reality it was less interesting. The story that was included in my edition at the back was more interesting, which features a 6 foot tall sentient penis wandering the streets of Paris.
There is a link between having an orgasam (its fluids and 'slow-slidings') with writing (verbal vomit, a poetic deluge)Irreverent and humorous. I enjoyed the voyeurism, the obsession, the images where the narrator spills and rants. The dream is terrifying. O delicate text of Aragon.
Un texte immense qui aurait été épuré par le temps. Tout ce qui est superflue, maladroit, redondant, agressif a été érodé, gommé. Seul l’essentiel demeure. J’aime les associations, insolites, inattendues, décalées..L'absence de verbes donne des idées, ouvre une porte. On se sent à la ligne de partage des eaux, on ne sait si le flot va s'orienter vers la mer mediterrannée ou vers l'atlantique. Il y a une certaine pleinitude dans le désespoir.. J'ai tout simplement adoré !
Este é daqueles títulos que li porque um amigo me recomendou, porque o título me cativou e porque há muito sentia curiosidade pelos movimentos surrealistas. Na minha opinião o livro começa bastante bem, vai-se tornando confuso e engraçado pelo meio, mas perde toda a piada quando o autor se começa a perder com descrições absurdas, confusas e bastante chatas.
J'ai été captivée et fascinée par ma lecture au même titre que repoussée et dérangée à certains moments. Je suis arrivée à la fin avec une sensation de faim au vue de la brièveté du livre. Une narration incisive et inhabituel sur l'érotisme et l'amour que je vous recommande fortement : http://bookymary.blogspot.co.uk/2016/...
I read this book, first, because it was really short and a nice diversion during the run-up to finals week and, second, because William T. Vollmann cited it as a major influence to his not-so-short book The Royal Family. Vollmann mentioned in an interview that he thought the book had some "pretty sentences." I think that is about all that can or should be said about it.
Hasta en los momentos menos aventurados, "Le con d'Irène" me asombra. A la segunda vuelta y en versión original (con una little help del diccionario), se ferocidad poética me ha gustado todavía más. Bella y económica edición de Mercure de France. Sugestivo el breve prólogo de Sollers.
