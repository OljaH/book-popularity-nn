Disclaimer: Jeaniene and I are BFF. There are many Draculas but there is only one Vlad. Hehehehe.Loved it. It reminded me of Halfway to the Grave in the best possible way: it has the same blend of action and intimacy. There is a lot of violence, but the focus is on Vlad and Leila. This book is like watching the leading couple lost in a kiss while things are blowing up all around them.
I love Jeaniene Frost. I've read every book she's published, and they are all on my keeper shelf. From the beginning her version of Vlad has captivated me. I'm so glad he got his own series. He is one of my favorite heroes. Bad to the bone, delicious, sarcastic, keeps himself set apart (for good reason!) but wow, when he falls for a girl, he FALLs for a girl. It's magic to read.
5 Electrifying Stars*Spoilers*First read 3/2/2014 Reread 12/2/2015"I'll ask a second time," his deep, slightly accented voice said. "Who are you, and how the hell are you inside my head?"-Vlad "What made you choose the name Vlad?" I asked, unable to resist adding, "It's not the most original vampire name you could have picked, after all." Instead of being offended, that little smirk was back. "I'm the only authentic Vlad. Everyone else is merely an envious imitation."-Leila and VladOnce Burned,
I have loved Vlad since the first time I read about him in the night huntress series.
My most trusted staff members have their rooms there, too."-Vlad What this book is about When Leila was young she touched a downed power line, it didn't kill her but it left her with some life changing side effects.
But she tells him that some vampires are looking to kill him and have kidnapped her, and she ask for his help.
This book only made me fall more in love with Vlad.
OMG I loved that Vlad was Leila's first and that he treated her like it was a gift and not a burden.
When Leila is kidnapped by other vampires, she is forced to use some of her other 'gifts' that came about after the energy absorbed from the power line.
*swoon*As things get even more dangerous for Vlad and Leila, Vlad brings her family to his castle as well for protection.
Again, Bones loves to tease Vlad and he grabs the chance to tease at him when he teaches Leila how to block Vlad from reading her mind.If I had one complaint about this book, it would only be the ending.
This was very frustrating only because we have waited so long as it is for Vlad to have his own book.
5 stars – Vampire/Paranormal/Urban Fantasy RomanceThoughts Before Reading:I am practically panting and salivating for Vlad’s book!Thoughts After Reading:I am practically panting and salivating for Vlad’s next book!Like I said in my status update...Bones might be the reigning king of chapter 32, but Vlad is the Night Prince of chapter 23!
Inferno hotness!But in all seriousness...Bones is one of my all-time favorite Romancelandia husbands, and even though Vlad made a powerful showing, Bones still rules my loins supreme.Although I wouldn’t be opposed to a Bones/Shawna/Vlad ménage...just sayin’ I’m totally game for that, Ms. Frost, should you ever need a new character to shake and kink things up a bit in the Night Huntress World!Vlad is enigmatic, blazing hot, darkly possessive, and compellingly cruel, and I enjoyed his relationship with spunky Leila.
Vlad, Vlad, Vlad, VLAD!!!!!!!!!
I gave this four stars.*Rocks backwards and forwards*What is happening to me?!
What am I turning into?I just really liked how plot-heavy is was.
I liked Vlad as a character but I thought it was Leila who really made this novel.
It's not the usual backwards and forwards.Her: "I really like him but I don't know if he likes me."Him: "Wow. I really like you."Her: "He's just saying that because he wants someone.
I wish it were true."*Sexual tension**Interruption**Lots of sex**Plot resolution**Happily ever after*It can get a bit tiring, but this wasn't and I really want to see where Frost takes it from here.But...but...
I had it on my bookshelf for ages, so I decided that I should finally read it. I loved Vlad in Cat&Bones books. I love him in this book too. And Leila seemed a bit less annoying than Cat. So this was a pretty nice surprise. I just hope that Vlad will keep his bloodthirsty and cruel personality. That's why I like him so much. Thought, he is starting listening to Leila way too much. Come on she is a human; he lived for centuries. Who is going to be right and have a better plan?
Having met Vlad before in the Night Huntress Series, I was really excited that he would be getting his very own book.Once Burned the 1st book in the Night Prince Series begins when Vlad rescues Leila, whose gifts may be a way that vampires could take him down.He takes her to his castle in Romania, where he promises to protect her and also to give her the real story of Vlad aka Dracula……   The story is told by Leila’s POV – transformed instead of being killed when she touched a power line, she’s
The story is told by Leila’s POV – transformed instead of being killed when she touched a power line, she’s left with a gift of her right hand sending bolts of electricity to anyone she touches.
I actually liked her a lot!!!Loved the interaction between Vlad & Leila and the secondary characters…most of all…Cat & Bones…swoonnnnnnnnnnn!!!The story ended pretty suddenly and I suppose one could say that the epilogue leaves us with a somewhat cliffhanger…but knowing that we are going to get more of Vlad and Leila….that was enough for me.Can’t wait for book #2.My favourite quote:
At least that's what Jeaniene Frost wants us to believe. "If I felt nothing more for you than lust, Maximus would be on that pole for a week, and you, my lovely interloper, would not be here with me now."Hardly the words you'd find on a Hallmark card, but they caused a glow of happiness nonetheless.3.5 stars. Okay, so I might be exaggerating just a little. Vlad Tepesh (a.k.a. the Dracula) was still up to his pole-impaling ways, although he didn't come off nearly as menacing as the legend portra
After finding myself starting to lose steam with the NH series (I still haven't read book 6 after being extremely disappointed with book 5), at least this book felt like we were heading into some new territory.The first half of the book was a lot of fun.
It wasn't that the second half of the book was boring (okay, maybe a couple of chapters were...eh, that's minor though) but I was already starting to feel like I was ready to be done with the story once Vlad and Leila hooked up.
My mouth is literally watering whilst thinking about Vlad - he is one sexy a$$ed mofo. Can't wait for this^^
I was a bit skeptical at first (aren’t I always?) about Frost using such a huge historical figure as a protagonist, but she handled that part well: she stayed very close to what the world knows about the real Vlad III Tepes.
Frost chose to put emphasis on his other traits like arrogance and ruthlessness – all understandable, of course, he is Vlad the Impaler after all – but he seemed too cold somehow, and I didn’t get the attraction between him and Leila at all.
*BEFORE*OMFGWTFBBQBOOYAH!!!!......I don't like beards.But I like Vlad.So I just imagine Vlad without a beard, until Frost mentions his stupid beard, and then I get annoyed all over again.I <3 Jeaniene Frost.*POST-READ*IT'S NOT A BEARD! (Yes, I know I'm super late lol) I love him. That is all.P.S. Leila's slap was definitely one of the highlights of the book. You go, gurl!
I think I'm probably the only person on the planet who hasn't read Jeaniene Frost's Night Huntress series, even though Cat and Bones get rave reviews.
But I found Once Burned, the first book in her Night Prince series available via audio from my library, so I decided to give it a shot.
Fun, sexy, intriguing, the world, the people, the plot....everything combined made this a very entertaining read.
Vlad is one crazy alpha vampire and in my opinion, he stole the show.The audio was terrific.
A pretty impressive narration.I'm looking forward to reading and listening to more by this team.
Her good friend, and vampire Marty (who is all of four feet tall) can handle her electricity to an extent, allowing her to perform and touch him without fear.Her odd abilities get noticed by the wrong type of person, and she ends up being kidnapped by not so nice vampires.
He is enamored with her, and with all of his arrogance he knows she will eventually be in his bed.Since Leila electrocutes everyone she touches, she has lived a lonely life.
I don’t mind that with her Night Huntress series but I really wanted to hear Vlad’s voice and thoughts.While Bones and Cat make a very brief appearance, we meet some new people in this book.
But maybe the scariest monster that she knows is Marty, the four foot and one inch co-worker who has been protected her for years like a daughter and who is also a VAMPIRE.Yes, Leila knows about vampires and she knows that she needs to avoid them.
Unfortunately Leila is uniquely gifted and theses vampires know that.
He does not really care about these four idiotic vampires, but he senses that Leila is unique and he wants her.
An admirable heroine.Leila is not the kind of heroine I would like to see next to Vlad.
The Vlad I know wouldn’t even spare her a second look.I get that Frost had Megan Fox in mind when creating Leila’s image so one could say that Vlad was simply physically attracted to her.
See the difference?Vlad wanting to make Leila HIS.
No, I’m not buying it.Audience: Did you not like Leila??Anzu: No, I did not like her.
And that’s how it’s done!You know who would be a good enough woman for Vlad?
Posted at Yummy Men & Kick Ass Chicks It was in 2011, what seems like forever ago, that Jeaniene Frost wrote some of the most *squee* educing words on her blog ever. “I am also contracted to write the first two books in a new series featuring – you guessed it – Vlad as the hero.”OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!I swear, there was a small worldwide earthquake the day Jeaniene announced that caused by all the women who *squeed* upon hearing that news.For any of you read the Night Huntress series, you are we
“I am also contracted to write the first two books in a new series featuring – you guessed it – Vlad as the hero.”OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!I swear, there was a small worldwide earthquake the day Jeaniene announced that caused by all the women who *squeed* upon hearing that news.For any of you read the Night Huntress series, you are well aware of whom Vlad is.
And even though the end of the book didn’t end with a clean HEA, I think Leila is a great match and I am anxious to see how she breaks down his walls completely.Vlad has power over fire but he’s not the only one with fun abilities.
Once Burned is the first book in the Night Prince series, a spin-off of the Night Huntress series, and is featuring my favorite character: Vlad!
We already had glimpses of Vlad’s past from his time with Cat (main character of the Night Huntress series) but we got a more throughout display of his history in this novel.
We are also blessed with a glimpse behind the hard shell Vlad always keeps up because even though he won’t admit it, he falls for Leila.
The main story line revolve around finding the vampire who ordered Leila’s kidnapping with the ultimate goal of killing Vlad.
I'm Disappointed.
Is that it?I get it, Its a series we've got to leave some stuff for the next books, but that doesn't excuse ...ummm this lack luster start to a series.
Frost has great characters to build off of but doesn't deliver Its really quite annoying.
The book was boring and the characters weren't even that likable.
I expect way more of a paranormal vet who has a much anticipated novel.
I mean , the novel is half assAnd don't get me started on the end.
I think i will wait for Kresley Cole to put out her two awaited novels, Those NEVER disappoint.
3.5 starsThis was a strong start to the series, but what it lacked was the Hero POV.
Because that was lacking, he felt cold and distant.
I had a really hard time connecting.
He is not known for being warm and fuzzy and is pretty silent so it is understandable the heroine and I both had issues figuring him out.
The dead ex does not play a huge part so not really an issue for me like it normally would be.There was a lot of action, the heroine was pretty brave and I liked her special abilities.
3 1/2 Tepid Stars for Vlad Tepesh!!Don't expect to get that same feeling when you first read about Cat and Bones, this book can't hold a candle to Halfway to the Grave, but in it's own right it was pretty good!
I did feel though, the Vlad in Once Burned was a different Vlad who we met in the Night Huntress series.
The end fell a little flat, but it is a continuing series, so hopefully it will come around in the second book as Vlad and Leila continue to explore their relationship!
(because I'm scared to lose my favorite friends over this book...) I think it's a fun read, and I love the actual Vlad history and locations throughout Romania that Frost writes about.
It was steamy, to be sure, but I think Vlad has shown himself to be a better guy than he is in this book.
There's a great deal of action at the end of the book.
All in all it's a fun read, but I don't think it does Vlad justice.
My favorite scene with Vlad is when he talks Cat down from killing herself in At Grave's End, night huntress 3.
Repeat that whenever Tepesh is around you, and he'll run screaming in no time." With the unforgiving gift of Psychometry, with one touch Leila can sense the persons most unforgivable sin, or regret or future and therefore she avoids contact with everyone she encounters at all cost, except her work partner Marty.
"if it's not, I'll kill him and return to you directly." He's ruthless and demands loyalty, he's possessive with what he deems "his", his witt kept me laughing while readung, his charm had me swooning his every word, his mysterious side left me yearning to know more about him, and his arrogance that made him such an ass has pushed me into full fangirl obsession mode with Vlad.
With Shrapnel and Marty, there’s plenty to flesh out a whole series.Vlad’s enemies are closing in and there’s a very thrilling climax to the story when we get to see Vlad at his very most deadly – angered by the threat to Leila.
After the big showdown, things are left very unresolved between Vlad and Leila and I think it pays to remember how we left Cat and Bones at the end of Halfway to the Grave and remember this is just the first of a series and that there is a long way to go yet – got to keep that sexual chemistry fizzing for the next one.
And while it was, thankfully, not a disappointment, it wasn't as great as I'd hoped it'd be either.I feel like this isn't the Vlad we've come to know and love from Night Huntress.
Nonetheless, I keep reminding myself that Once Burned is from Leila's POV and while we've seen the many facets of Vlad's personality before, she hasn't, and the book is naturally going to reflect that.I have lukewarm feelings for Leila.
This book most assuredly did.Once Burned is the long awaited Night Huntress spinoff, featuring Vlad.
I could believe it when I watched her fall in love with him.Leila is human, but she isn't normal.
But Vlad isn't quite willing to let her go after that.
The plot is interesting, the writing is conversational, and the pacing was so good that I didn't want to put down the book, even hours past my bedtime.Night Huntress fans will be happy to know we get cameos from some familiar faces.
Vlad is the star of this book.
“That one tickled. If electrocution is your way of flirting, I commend you on your originality.”  Leila Dalton learned at thirteen that life is full of darkness. A tragic accident left her body scarred, her dreams in ashes and with the terrifying ability to channel electricity and see the past, present and future of a person with a mere touch. When Leila inadvertently saves a woman’s life, her sudden celebrity status makes her the focus of evil men who needs her to find the world’s most feared
And when Vlad meets the beautiful Leila whose powers seems to match his own deadly ability to control fire, a fierce passion ignites, one that neither can deny.
Because we only get Leila’s POV and Vlad is so good at hiding his true feelings, it was difficult figuring him out, but through her brief glimpses into his past and present a lot was explained about him, how broken he is, and that made me just love him even more.
I loved how possessive and protective Vlad was over Leila, and the sexy times were scorching!
But the Night Huntress series (by the same author) is better.http://www.amazon.com/Once-Burned-Nig...This was pretty good paranormal romance.
I wasn't expecting the POV to come from someone other than Vlad, but I guess he'd be pretty tough to write.
Leila was one of the more likeable female PNR protagonists.
One huge thing that was missing was the funny Vlad from the Night Huntress series.
I guess with the plot, it was understandable, but Vlad's sense of humor is one of his best qualities.
Without it, he's just an arrogant jerk, actually.
A hot jerk, but still.
Upgraded to 5 stars upon a reread. I can't believe that the majority of my friends haven't read this series, it's so amazing. Humor, adventure, and hot at the same time. I'd write a real review but I'm too lazy.---------6/14-----------------4.5 starsVlad was cool, Leila was awesome. That is all.Follow me on ♥ Facebook ♥ Blog ♥ Instagram ♥ Twitter ♥
