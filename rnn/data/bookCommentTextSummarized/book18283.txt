5+ stars!  This series is 100% NA greatness! It’s got everything you would want in an NA read. It’s funny, sexy, sweet and the characters are not at all annoying which seems like a rarity in most NA books anymore. Elle Kennedy really excels at writing these college/hockey books. The Deal was fantastic for me, but I have to say… I loved The Mistake EVEN MORE than the first book. As much as I liked Garrett, Logan really just made this book for me. When I read about John Logan in The Deal, I knew I
It’s funny, sexy, sweet and the characters are not at all annoying which seems like a rarity in most NA books anymore.
As much as I liked Garrett, Logan really just made this book for me.
When I read about John Logan in The Deal, I knew I wanted his book.
He has a great set of friends and he’s loving life.
I kind of love that she didn’t give in to Logan so easily.
I also loved that she was supportive of him and what he felt he needed to do with his life after college.
Really good college romance! I have to admit, I still loved The Deal better (it had more of a "spark" to it), but this was a fun read too.Review to come :)
Aside from Hannah and Garrett (from book 1) the guys in this book – including Logan – have getting laid at the top of their to do lists and all the girls can’t help but want to get nailed and desperately want to lose their virginity, like the heroine Grace for an example (this is literally the first thought of hers I read).
I won’t hide that book 1 also touched on this kind of setting, but at least in that book the author didn’t allow her main characters to fall victim to that kind of mentality unlike Logan and Grace here.
But he’s still mending his heart, trying to get over Hannah and doesn’t know if Grace is just a sexy distraction or something more…In her usual fashion, Elle Kennedy delivered very steamy, get ready to change your panties New Adult romantic comedy, that will make your heart swell, your lady parts beg for attention and laugh out loud like crazy lunatic.The Mistake simply doesn’t disappoint.
I am sure that every person who has read and enjoyed The Deal, will love and cherish next part of Off – Campus Series.
I love the college drama because it brings back memories.
:) Okay, here is quick 2 sentence sum up of this book: One evening Logan ends up at the wrong apartment where he meets Grace.
A MISTAKE is made that leads to Logan trying to woo his way back into her good graces.
THE DATING GAME questions with Logan and Grace:
I don’t know … yeah.
HOW HAS DATING LOGAN "CORRUPTED" YOU?
That seems like an appropriate amount of time.”~Now that you’ve gotten to know Logan and Grace a little better have fun reading about them in THE MISTAKE.
John Logan is the hot, handsome and popular college jock who is pining for his best friend's girl.
Besides, this is New Adult, virgin heroines and manwhore heroes are staples, but that's where the similarities with other NA books end.
John Logan and Grace Ivers may be your typical college-age kids but they both have goals, ambitions and life outside "finding the one".
I simply love the banter not only between Grace and Logan but also between Logan, Garrett, Tucker and Dean.
I wonder whose book is next?ARC provided by Elle Kennedy in exchange for an honest review.Logaaaannnnnnnnn!!!
But after stumbling upon Pearl's and Nicoleta's awesome reviews (click their names to read them!) I decided to continue with Logan's story and oh boy I am so glad I did!
Having a thing for his best friend's girlfriend was driving him nuts, and when he met sweet and funny Grace he thought that he was using her as a distaction, so he messed up.
The Mistake was one of the sexiest books I've ever read but still it wasn't just about sex!
I totally understood why it was so hard for her to trust Logan, and her stupid jackass scene made me love her even more!
There are always high expectations when you read a sequel to book that was so good that you worry if the next one will manage to keep up.
And when Logan made his mistake, she stomped her feet and made him work for it, though she knew she would be giving him a chance.- I loved Logan.
That boy sure knew what to do to redeem himself.- I loved their relationship.
Seriously, these four hockey hotties know how to make you laugh and melt your heart at the same time.- I loved the story.

So when one night trying to forget about his messed of life he meets Grace, he’s surprised how he can’t push her out of his mind.
Until they meet again and this time Logan is settled on proving Grace that she’s the girl for him.
I believe this series is on its way of becoming some of the best NA books of the moment.

4.5 AMAZING GRACE STARS...Technically I am old enough to be Logan's grandmother!!
The cover is perfect to depict Logan so I am not even going to waste my time on Pinterest looking for him ...Loved meeting the characters from THE DEAL!
no wonder I fecking loved you.There are some real LOL moments in this book.
I gave the last book 4 stars.
I think Logan's struggle and his commitment to family was really heart wrenching and that is why it was maybe a better read for me.Cannot wait for the next book in the series.
4.5 Stars  He absolutely makes me nervous. He's John fucking Logan, one of the most popular guys at this college. And I'm Grace fucking Ivers, one of thousand of girls who are crushing on him.  You know what I love? A sexy bad boy. Know what I love even more? A good grovel. What else? A sassy and sharp witted heroine that makes the sexy bad boy work for it. So this book? My golden trifecta. If you've read The Deal, then you remember Logan, Garrett's best friend and roommate and also the poor bas
Unfortunately before Logan realizes just how perfect Grace is for him he manages to fuck things up so perfectly there may be no fixing it.I'd say this book is split in 2 halves; 1.
As much as I liked Grace in the first half of the book, I absolutely loved her in the 2nd half.
To be honest seeing how Logan was crushing on Hannah in the last book and this one I was afraid that he'd be "settling" for Grace.
I seriously loved every page of this book.
I loved him and Grace together.

If you haven't heard of a book called The Deal by this same author, then you definitely need to go and check it out.
Logan starts talking to Grace after finding out they share a mutual like of action movies, something he hasn't done with any girl in a while.
I loved seeing Garrett and Hannah in this book, as well as some new characters make an appearance.
I had some great laughs with this one, and the steam was super-hot for an NA book.
I loved seeing another part of Logan that we didn't get to see from the first book.
*****FOUR STARS*****{BR with Mel, Sharon, and Dee} I really enjoyed this book. It had some lovable characters, a few laugh out loud moments, and definitely several panty melting inducing scenes as well.Although I found this an enjoyable read, I couldn't help but compare it to "The Deal", and find that it didn't quite measure up. I didn't like that Logan was so hung up on Hannah, and then the realization later on just made me roll my eyes a bit. Grace was a very head strong heroine and she didn't
Grace was a very head strong heroine and she didn't put up with any of Logan's crap.
I thought she kind of was a little too harsh with him and not quite enough with her supposed best friend, Ramona.Logan had his swoon worthy moments, especially when he saves Grace's reputation after some slanderous comments are made about her on the internet.
His family dynamic was pretty messed up and his reasons for turning down the chance to make it to Pro Hockey was not really believable to me.But there were some very memorable funny moments and once Logan got his head out of his ass, I was rooting for this couple to resolve their issues and get their HEA.Overall, this series is pretty fabulous and is one that is not to be missed!!
I had such a great time reading this story and I can truly say I did not hate any of the main characters at all and boy, I did love Grace!You all know I always find something I don't like in a female character but I honestly adored Grace.
And I loved that Hannah was the one who made him see the truth and I appreciated that because I didn't want to read a whole book where he was feeling guilty about his feelings and yet trying to make a relationship with Grace work.Anyhow, I liked how he didn't run away from his feelings and how he fought.
And lazy.I really enjoyed this...just not as much as The Deal...which is odd as I truly enjoyed both Logan and Grace just as much - if not more - than Garrett and Hannah.So far I have been very happy with Kennedy's female leads.
And, most importantly, they manage to avoid causing me to harbor homicidal tendencies toward them - a seemingly tremendous feat these days it seems.However, I felt that this one was a little slow to get going...and I just didn't find the conflict here to be as compelling as I would have liked.
Otherwise, another Kennedy winner.I'll be curious to see what happens with the walking STD that is Dean in book three.
John Logan feels!I've buddyread this book with my pretty sis Bea who by the way, just celebrated her birthday yesterday.
This time around, the story focuses on John Logan, star defenseman of Briar's hockey team, and Grace Ivers, a freshman girl who's been infatuated with him ever since she attended college at Briar.
Since The Deal, I already found Logan's character interesting so I decided to really read it ASAP because I feel like I'll be missing a lot if I won't.
Logan and Grace made me fall in love with their romantic interactions and steamy encounters.
4.5 Understanding What You Actually Want Stars * * * * 1/2  Spoiler FreeEarlier this year I had the extreme pleasure of reading The Deal by Elle Kennedy (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).
Grace is happy with Logan; she decides she wants to be WITH him...and when all of it comes together...Logan fumbles...he says and does somethings which cause pain for both...It only takes a moment and conversation with a good friend to figure out he effed up big time.
The Mistake (OC 02), by Elle Kennedy: 4 “Barn Burner” Stars.It’s another victory for the Off Campus series as hometown favorite John Logan alternately stumbles and grand gestures his way into the heart of sweet, little freshman Grace Ivers, in Elle Kennedy’s The Mistake.THE PLAYERS:John Logan: 3 time National Division I Hockey Championship winner.
Logan retaliates with a buzz beating Grand Gesture, and it’s GAME OVER!
As John Logan chalks up another victory for team Off Campus.The Mistake (Off Campus 02), by Elle Kennedy: 4 “Barn Burner” Stars.In the end, I liked the second Off Campus book just as much as the first.
It has been a long time since I read 'The Deal' and I was worried that I would have forgotten important details.
Although it is part of a series, 'The Mistake' can be read as a standalone.
This time around, the focus is on John Logan, aka Logan, and Grace.
Before he knows it, his feelings for Grace have completely superseded whatever misplaced feelings he attached to his best friend's girlfriend.However, by the time he realizes how he feels, it may be too late.
Thankfully, Grace doesn't let him off the hook easily and makes him work for her forgiveness.
3.5 Stars ”It’s funny. Less than a week ago I was bemoaning the lack of excitement in my life, and now look at me – sexy hockey players showing up at my door to excite the hell out of me. Fuck it. I’m giving myself an award.” This second installment in the Off-Campus series is about John Logan, best friend and hockey teammate of Garrett Graham from book one of the series. Logan’s stuck on his feelings for his best friend’s girl Hannah and has been staying away from the happy couple of book one o
Logan’s stuck on his feelings for his best friend’s girl Hannah and has been staying away from the happy couple of book one of this series, which if you living under a rock please pick up- I loved it.
Logan’s realization comes a bit too late and so we are awarded John Logan in full blown wooing mode (again a lot of fun).
Overall, I love how the author’s portrays this house full of hockey players and their banter with one another and I’m looking forward to Dean’s story and hopefully the man who tried sporting that beard, he seemed like so much fun!
How old would you be if you didn't know how old you are?5 I love this stupid jackass STARSGrace and Logan .. ♥ Yeah, I'll let you set the paceCause I'm not thinking straight ..►♫ The only thing tougher than a hockey player is his girlfriend.What are you doing?Well, you were looking at me like you wanted me to kiss you. These Players, Friends, these BROTHERS! I could listen to them for days. I swear they should have their own talk show because I WOULD HANDS DOWN .. WATCH ALL THE TIME! Even readin
How old would you be if you didn't know how old you are?5 I love this stupid jackass STARSGrace and Logan ..
Even reading a few passages will make you want to dive into this series (TRUST ME).You know that Yeti-beard doesn't make you look more manly, right?I was going for rugged, actually.Well, it's not that, either, Babyface.
You look like a mad scientist.What if I lost her for good this time?You didn't, Garrett assures me.How can you be so sure of that?Because she told you she loves you.You stupid jackass, Tucker adds with a grin.You're gonna have to fix this one all on your own.
4.5 Stars!Well done Elle Kennedy, well done! I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as The Deal but I did, dammit. Even more than the first! Logan was.....Grace was......not annoying at all! Yep, still shocked! I love the banter between the guys......Garrett, Logan, Dean, Tucker! I can't wait for the rest of the books in the series! The Deal would have been perfect without that little thing in the end.....you know, the thing. The thing wasn't really in this one! I don't like the thing. Another Elle Kennedy winner people!
So in an homage to those fantastic times I bring to you, The Mistake version of:Never have I ever …❉ Never have I ever … ended up in the wrong place when looking for a party.❉ Never have I ever … made a ‘mistake’ with the opposite sex.❉ Never have I ever … made a guy do ridiculous things for me in retaliation for that kind of mistake, just so I could laugh behind his back (and in his face).❉ Never have I ever ...
done ridiculous things, for a guy who I made a mistake with, all for the sake of a second chance.Anyone drunk yet?
Another steamy, swoon worthy, romantic comedy from Elle Kennedy. I have really enjoyed this series so far. Logan and Grace were great characters and they shared some wonderful moments, but I felt like there was something missing, and I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it was their issues and how quickly they were resolved, or maybe my expectations were too high. idk. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, I just think it had the potential to be phenomenal. Regardless, the writing and characters are excellent, and I'm looking forward to continuing this series.
“Are you trying to buy your way into my good graces?”“Yup. And excellent pun, by the way.”“I wasn’t punning. My name just happens to be a homonym.”“I love it when you talk homonyms to me.”  There are books you read in a week, there are books that you might even finish over a couple of days, and then there are those addictive little gems that you inhale all at once, reading non-stop, often in the wee hours of the morning, showing complete disregard for your real life responsibilities, and lovin
Secretly, however, Logan craves the kind of intimacy and emotional bond his best friend and teammate, Garrett Graham, has found in his life, to the point of convincing himself of being in love with his best friend’s girl.When Logan and Grace accidentally meet, they are both pleasantly surprised by how effortless and enjoyable it is to spend time in each other’s company, their flickering attraction gaining momentum quickly and irresistibly, and while one kiss is all it takes for it to ignite, one confession is all it takes to destroy their budding relationship.
Not a man to give up easily on what he wants the most in life, Logan then commences his stubborn and utterly entertaining pursuit of the woman who has captured his heart like no other before her, determined to make her forgive him and give them one more chance.
5 "Question." His eyes twinkle. "Hit me." STARSWho knew going back to university would be so much fun???  I'll admit, having simply ADORED the first book, I was kinda scared that my expectations were too high and that I’d be disappointed. Well, Ms. Kennedy did it again! Just simply loved this book, such a great read. College junior and sexy hockey star, Logan, meets Grace Ivers, the pretty "girl next-door" freshman, by mistake.

Just simply loved this book, such a great read.
College junior and sexy hockey star, Logan, meets Grace Ivers, the pretty "girl next-door" freshman, by mistake.
And from there, their relationship grows, stalls and restarts through a series of mistakes (some BIG and some small).
If you've not read The Deal or you have but, like me, you're not too sure if it'll hit it again, IT DOES.
You must read this book.
I highly recommend this book and series!Guest reviewer for SlutSistas Book Blog.
For more reviews and blog posts.
Una novela que te mantiene atrapado entre sus páginas desde el principio, pero no consigue transmitir tanto como la primera parte de la saga.La pareja central de esta novela es muy diferente a la de #KissMe 1 (la cual, por cierto, hace acto de presencia).
En cuanto a la trama, un poco más floja que el anterior, pero mucho más amena.
Es decir, es una novela más sencilla, con más sexo y que se lee mucho más rápido.
No es mejor que el primer libro, aunque las escenas de sexo son muy buenas.

One chance meeting, that one moment, that one mistake.There will be awwww moments, giggling moments, douche bag moments, jackass moments and that all important moment when you fall in love with this book..HE'S A PLAYER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
This author has fast become one of my favourites on my facebook stalkers list..I was all mushy over Garrett but Logan by passes him by a mile for me, he's a jackass who just has no idea, he's a player, when he loves he loves fully, he sucks at poems, he's real..
***4,5 "You stupid jackass" stars*** I loved "the Deal" and i was waiting like crazy for Logan's turn... The guy was cute and hilarious, but when his time had come, everybody was talking about how Logan wasn't like Garrett, and that fact made me to holding back... But why the fuck i was waiting???Now, I'm the position to say that i liked this story... even though that Logan made a mistake!!!I liked the plot, i liked Logan even when he wasn't good, i loved Grace... This girl was so great!!!Logan
I loved "the Deal" and i was waiting like crazy for Logan's turn...

even though that Logan made a mistake!!!I liked the plot, i liked Logan even when he wasn't good, i loved Grace...
Her best friend was drugging her along to parties but she never find a guy to stay long enough around her, especially when she was starting bubbling like crazy...I personally think that her bubbling was so adorable...
