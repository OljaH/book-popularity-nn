I really needed a doses of twisted laughs and creepy nonsense.
By the end of the year, apparently the whole universe is plotting against me and loads of work are piling up next to my massive to-read pile.
One is the fun pile, the other one is the academic/work pile.
And people couldn't care less about this, so, when I have time, I'll write a proper review.
You know, one that is, actually, about the book and not my personal whatever.
Although, I'll probably forget all about it and this is what people are going to read for months.
This tiny creature, my 10-year-old sister, loves stories, especially those with a touch of weirdness and horror (OK, I admit, this is my "fault").
Usually I'm the one who has to make them up for her, but sometimes she comes to me with that cute "can we read books?" question.
Of course we can, silly.
"...preferably with pictures." You mean - Edward Gorey?
Gorey's one of our favourite writers, and we enjoy reading him together.
"Some stories are stupid", my sister explained her 4 star rating.
Still, it's Edward Gorey...
Can we read it all over again?" Of course we can :)
Edward Gorey's work is one of those rare things that consistently renews my faith in the awesome potential of human creativity.Is that corny enough of a review for ya?
Yeah, I know it sounds really gross, but it's true.
Looking at his pictures makes me want to try harder to resuscitate the numbed 98% of my brain I never use for anything at all.
Edward Gorey made all this stuff, and he's a human being just like me!
Or maybe he isn't.
Maybe he's some weird spidery creature with dark frightening eyes who lives under the stairs in the basement of a haunted Victorian.
That would explain some things.
Mis historias favoritas de este volumen son [El libro sin título], El murciélago dorado, Los primos dementes, El niño Pío, Las conjuraciones irrespetuosas e Historia para Sara, pero realmente todas las historias son recomendables.
Por ejemplo, El libro sin título es la aparición de unas criaturas extrañas, sacadas del nivel más profundo del subconsciente; El murciélago dorado es la carrera artística de una bailarina de balet; Los primos dementes es una narración sobre desgraciados y miserables que comparten un vinculo sanguíneo y la Historia de Sara, cuya autor es Alphonse Allais no E.
Edward Gorey.
**.I’m not relating well to Gorey’s work.
The drawings are, in the main, clever and well done, but are often not related to any of the verbiage associated with them.
I’d have to classify myself as a non-Gorey fan.
That leaves me with only one of his books on my TBR pile.
This one is a compendium from many of his former books from 1953 – 1965.
It serves a purpose, I guess, since copies of the original books are almost unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
It was from a book whose title is not given.
I’m not sure what it means.
See what I mean?
4.5 stars!  EDWARD GOREY’S MOST DISTURBING STORIES PART TWO! After reading the first volume of Edward Gorey’s “Amphigorey,” I decided to check out the second volume “Amphigorey Too” and see if my inner Edward Gorey fan girl self would enjoy this volume as much as the first volume. I will admit that I was amazed at this second volume as it is just as disturbing and interesting as the first volume!In this volume, there are a total of twenty stories collected by Edward Gorey, which includes: 1) Th

Just like the first volume, Edward Gorey has done a brilliant job with both writing and illustrating this book!
Mildly entertaining. A series of multi-panel stories.Some of Gorey's stories are interesting, some are mildly disturbing (like the dead child on the side of the road, who was saved from being abused at the orphanage), and some are just... "huh?" or "ummm... okay..."The art is always darkly beautiful, of course.Overall, I guess I get enough Gorey from various random sources, one panel at a time, because I have no particular intent to read any of the other compendiums.
Best collection yet (between Amphogorey and Amphigorey Also) except this book was missing 3 stories and repeated 3 stories. It was quite distressing
As always, Gorey's art is masterful and subversive. Not much to add to this one.
Amphigorey Too's stories were much darker and I didn't enjoy them as much.
Even stranger, darker, and more nonsensical than I expected, though that's Gorey for you. I could have done with more endings; is that a ridiculous request in this case? The best selections for me were "The Evil Garden," "The Osbick Bird," "The Chinese Obelisks," and "The Limerick."
So witty, so darkly humorous and mocking. For Gorey fans - a feast!
"Literary nonsense", not a bad description of Gorey's works included in Amphigorey Too. If weird, disturbing stories suit you, then you'll have a blast with these 20 gems.
"The Beastly Baby", "The Pious Infant", "The Osbick Bird", "The Deranged Cousins", "The Disrespectful Summons", and "The Abandoned Sock".
"The Beastly Baby" ends with an eagle fumbling the demon baby from a great height:There was a wet sort of explosion, audible for several miles.
was the end of the Beastly Baby."The Pious Infant" goes theodicy on the bit.
All kinds of weirdness on display.Just like its predecessor Amphigorey, Amphigorey Too showcases Gorey's surreal, nonsensical, demented style.
Gorey's a rare one.

Maybe I don't have the art appreciation mind or this series of book is just plain boring. The sentences and stories are fun to read at first glance, and that's it. I'm not sure what I got from reading 2 books in this series.
I looked for volume one in the library and came away with volumes two, three, and four instead. This decidedly Gorey volume (two) is exactly what we’ve all come to expect from the master of the macabre etching. Ha! What a twisted brain this man had.
Impresionante, todo un divertido culto a la muerte desde la macabra perspectiva de Edward Gorey.Historias muy ingeniosas e ilustraciones espectaculares, cargadas de estilo único.
Still hauntingly amazing. I am very much looking forward to the forthcoming biography.
Delightful nonsense too.
Although each author employs his own distinct style of utilizing visuals to complement the narrative, each book presents smart, well-crafted writing with enough dark and offbeat characters and themes to offer endlessly appealing creative fodder for young adult readers, writers, and illustrators.Riggs creates a thoroughly entertaining tale using a collection of unusual and occasionally creepy black and white “found” photographs with a decidedly Victorian feel to guide the direction of his prose.
This novel takes the familiar “photo prompt” writing exercise to the next level and beyond.Like Riggs, Gorey’s illustrations also have a decidedly Victorian sensibility, and his narrative contains a definite darkness; however, this is where the similarities between these two books end.

I guess having a signature way of writing always helps an author in the sense that readers can then associate easily and know what they are in for after reading the first couple of stories or books.
I had not heard of Edward Gorey, till my friend at Book Sense spoke highly of him and I knew I had to read him.
There are children in these tales who die at the drop of a hat and before you know it even adults are killed and meet their end quite grotesquely sometimes.

‘Amphigory Too’ is a collection of twenty of Gorey’s works, including ‘The Beastly Baby’, ‘The Gilded Bat’ and ‘The Osbick Bird’.
‘The Gilded Bat’ is one of his best know pieces, the story of a poor girl who becomes a prima ballerina but who’s life still remains basically dreary.
‘The Osbick Bird’ I found rather sweet, being about the lifelong friendship between man and extremely large bird.
As for ‘The Beastly Baby’, well, I sympathized with the parents in that one.
Like any anthology it’s a mixed bag, but most of the stories included are winners.
Until Amphigorey Too, my only familiarity with Edward Gorey was through the eerie imagery and grim characters of the PBS Mystery!
It was such a delight to fall into a collection that evoked the same hypnotizing melancholy I felt watching the Mystery!
titles as a child (I would be ushered out of the living room once the actual episode started to be spared glimpses of TV crime scenes).
What I find most fascinating with Gorey's work is that despite the comfortless story lines and elegantly eerie illustrations, there is a sense of wit and light and life.
I can't wait to dive into the other Amphigorey titles.
Somehow, while I've been aware of Edward Gorey for years, I've never been much bothered to sit down and read some of his work.
And, having finally had the chance, I'm glad that I have.
In all honestly, not all of his work really grabs me, but the stuff that does grab me is pretty amazing.
His dark tales of evil infants, turtle-necked youth and fur coat-clad business men are wicked and witty, and appeals to my recently infatuation with Edwardian aesthetics.
So, in addition, the reads get better and more interesting too.
A quick read, but one worth checking out.
It was still great! I prefered "Amphigorey" but nonetheless, still fantastic. I'd have to say my fave story in this lot was "The Chinese Obelisks" it was odd at first, because of the double copies in the book. This collection of stories were highly entertaining. And in this set, Gorey used many pennames, And, auctually, this time I thought one of the stories wasn't by him. But it auctually was. I was also very fond of the few notes he left about certain stories. All in all, very good collection, can't wait to read the other two!
It's so hard rating a book when it is made up of multiple stories. Some of the stories were absolutely great! Others, not so much. It's much easier to rate each story individually.Beastly Baby- ****1/2Nursery Frieze- *Pious Infant- ****Evil Garden- ****1/2Inanimate Tragedy-*Gilded Bat-***1/2Iron Tonic-****Osbick Bird-****Chinese Obelisks-****Deranged Cousins-****Eleventh Episode-***Untitled Book-*Lavender Leotard-**Disrespectful Summons-***1/2Abandoned Sock-***Lost Lions-***Story for Sara-****Salt Herring-*Leaves from a Mislaid Album-***1/2A Limerick-***1/2
Amphigorey Too was my first introduction to Edward Gorey's poetic bleakness. I don't know what captivates me more: the intricate ink depictions, the witty and dark poems, or that brooding era of glamour Gorey captures so well. Combined together they are one of the loveliest forms of art I have ever seen. Each time I read this book, I remember that feeling of familiarity and wonder when I first discovered Edward Gorey.
