I think I saw this story on an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.   "Just as I’m about to give up, I see him. He watches me from under the hood of his jacket, reclining on a café chair. I know I should report this. He’s everywhere. And I mean everywhere. It almost seems like he knows where I’m going to be before I know." I swear I wasn't going to review this book. I'm actually reading a bunch of "dark" romance/erotica books as part of a project with my college book society - we're
What did it for me - and what made me want to review this book despite everything I've said - was Lexi's stupid, stupid fucking behaviour.
"Not sure why I’m taking orders from a man who likes to watch me from under a hood, but I am."
On top of all the "whisper-yelling" and "whisper-hissing" which is the only way people talk in this novel, and the endless amount of filler sex where Lexi waxes poetic about Twitch's beautiful dick.
I whisper, “I just want to know why you watch me?”Not answering, he states acidly, “It was a fucking good thing I was, don’t you think?”An awkward, foul silence follows.
For me, the book was hyped up to be a "dark read," which was the reason why I read it in the first place and when it ended up being more of a smutty guilty pleasure book, that feeling of disappointment is just....disappointing.The main problem I had with this book though is this: nearly 50% of the story is made up of filler sex.
(view spoiler)[It's obvious to the reader after a good 10% that Twitch is Antonio Falco, the little boy from the prologue.
(hide spoiler)] As the reader, when I know this way ahead of time before Lexi knows it, it just makes her character more of a tool.
"My type of work means I come across a lot of different types of people.
I'm sure he wasn't used to what he got from me.A hug.I told George that I worked with a lot of people who suffered mental illness, and that if he felt a panic attack coming on that I would be there for him..."
- so come on over and have your panic attack (???) with me, your random fucking neighbor, whom you just met?!Oh man, I'll be right fucking there, Super Woman!
5 RAW stars! After reading Raw, thought to myself... ‘Is this really the same author that wrote The Friend-Zoned series?’ Wow! Talk about diverse writing styles! Although it did have a touch of humor, this book was much more dark than her previous works. And I loved it! I wouldn’t call it a dark and disturbing read, although it did have its moments... the words that come to mind when I think of this book are: intense, erotic, suspenseful, gritty and, well, RAW. It's not a happy love story. But h
the words that come to mind when I think of this book are: intense, erotic, suspenseful, gritty and, well, RAW.
Author Note: This is not a love story.
Things with Twitch are different than anything she’s used to, but he did give her fair warning.
Twitch and Lexi together...
Lexi is ruined by Twitch, just as he wanted.
Full of secrets, Twitch doesn’t know how he feels.
I’m not one of those people who needs a sunshine and rainbows happy ever after every time I read a book.
Did I love how the book ended?
This is a story of a love gone wrong...
OMG....that ending.....I'm blinking back tears and pissed off at the same time!!
I don't see a #2 in Belle's shelves.....Gotta have a #2......Gotta digest this.I can't write a review of this book...for the past hour I have sat staring at my Word Doc ---- typing....deleting....typing.....deleting.

WHYYYYYYY?‘Some things in life are so sad that there are no words to describe the amount of sadness, grief, and sorrow a person is feeling.
Something bad happens and it brings hoodie stalker guy up close and personal with Alexa.
Twitch is very up front with Alexa when he tells her what he is about and uhhh how he likes it.
Second, Alexa and her internal battle with allowing Twitch to Dominate her..
Maybe that is easier said then done, don't know.My ThoughtsBasically I was unhappy with the reasoning Twitch used for going after Alexa.
“Monsters don't always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight.”Despite all the craziness , confusion , creepy stuff and shocking and heartbreaking ending, Knowing how this book was going to end did not stop me from shedding tears. I really did enjoy reading Raw.
This is a story of love gone bad."WARNING: This book is non-traditional M/F ROMANCE with a non-traditional ending.
If you're under age 18, please think twice and then you read this book.This is a dark/hard/broken/love story and it was really, really good.
And I have to tell you, I wasn’t expecting something pretty fucking fantastic story but here I am, with my heart broken into million pieces… If you like to read dark romance stories and if you’re comfortable with hard, kinky story you must read this book asap!
I know what you think you don’t like and are scared to try.
*****Spoiler Alert*****Spoiler Alert******Spoiler Alert***** "Monsters don't always lurk in the shadows"…"Sometimes they hide in plain sight" Lexi has a stalker named Twitch. And she kinda likes it. One night she is viciously attacked outside her apartment, and her stalker becomes her savior. Then her savior becomes her lover. God. This guy has me so hot and bothered I actually feel tipsy. I was all wrapped up in the story until learning Twitch was a brooding millionaire. That liked rough sex. I
Because this will definitely ruin it for you.(view spoiler)[1, the whole "I'm a drug dealing king pin" that kills snitches… and cuts eyeballs out with a switchblade would have been fine, but they had to go and make Twitch a millionaire.2, the whole "I'm a millionaire thing" who lives in a mansion and throws masquerade parties, (I'm so tired of that angle) because otherwise women wouldn't put up with crazy ass motherfuckers that like to "fuck dirty" and mess with their minds, unless they are rich.
That's a horribly weak plot!4, Oh and the moment Twitch cut that man's eyeball out and left him alive…..I knew the book would end tragically!!

I really enjoyed this reading Raw, Twitch and Lexi were hilarious and infuriating at times, but I had to know their story and where it would go!She's a social worker who has a soft spot for kids who've been forced onto the streets because of life at home.
She was mesmerised.I laughed, I got angry, I wanted to slap some sense into them and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Title: RawSeries: StandaloneAuthor: Belle AuroraRelease Date:  January 3rd, 2014Rating: 4.5 starsCliffhanger: No HEA:  (view spoiler)[ No  (hide spoiler)]Sweet, heartwarming and hilarious Belle Aurora is officially gone and I’m not sure if I mourned her for a single second.
In Raw she not only challenged herself, completely changing her usual style of writing from easygoing, snarky prose to something fifty shades of darker, she also challenged her readers, and I’m glad I took this test!
Their entirely opposite personalities were well thought and brilliant!Raw is not a fluffy love story.
In single, yet so meaningful plot, Aurora catches the truth of life and she doesn’t need a ‘knight in shining armor’ hero to picture true love.
Then I simply gave up and skipped to the last few paragraphs of the last chapter and then skimmed through an epilogue.IMO, this is a perfect "IF ONLY" book ...IF ONLY Twitch's characater appeared in a different book ...IF ONLY Lexi didn't have an IQ of a rubber band ...IF ONLY this book wasn't written in first person ...IF ONLY it wasn't that obvious that Twitch (view spoiler)[is a boy from the prologue (hide spoiler)] ...IF ONLY I cared enough to feel something ...
It just failed to provoke any sort of feelings in me and I hate those kinds of books.
5 Twitch stole my heart stars   Spoiler free   I feel like someone came and kicked me in my chest as hard as they could and leaving me there to care for myself.
Honestly that is how I feel right now.
It is so hard to come to terms with what I just read and type it down.
All I know is that this is my first 5 star book I have read in 2014.
I couldn't have asked for more of a perfect book, I couldn't.
There is nothing I would have changed.
Maybe something but when I think about it I am sad and hap
All I know is that this is my first 5 star book I have read in 2014.
It has been a long time since I have read a couple that compares to Twitch and Lexi.
I feel like their relationship is so unique that is is hard not to love it and want everything to come out happy roses and everyone dances.
I love when I start reading a book and I can't put it down for the life of me.
I know everyone has their own titles on what they think is dark.
I never got that feel from this book and nothing made me think that it was dark.
In fact, this nosey bitch did not open a single spoiler because I couldn't wait to cry and have an emotional breakdown of my very own....yeah, I'm weird like that.
Unfortunately the only thing I felt was ABSOLUTE annoyance thanks to Lexi's absurd behavior, and you can think I'm being harsh all you like, as even the character called herself pitiful, stupid and pathetic.
Now onto Twitch I felt nothing for his character.
I didn't get a single ladyboner while reading.
I kept waiting for Twitch to say "Come on,it's time to see the wizard.
PLEASE  don't let my opinions deter you from reading RAW.
Fan-freaking-tastic! I was shaking at that ending! After calming myself for 12 hours to decompress, here we go...  Do you like a book that's a little dirty? Ya know, where it's not all hearts and flowers, the sex isn't missionary with soothing music by Sinatra? Where the hero is really an anti-hero who starts out on a mission of revenge and ends up falling for his victim? Yes? Well, then Raw is the book for you! After reading Willing Captive by Belle Aurora, I knew I had to read this. Her writin
It captives the reader immediately, leaving you incapable of putting the book down.
So many reviews posted Ms. Aurora's warning at the start of this book- "This is not a love story.
I think this sets the reader up that love won't occur in this book.
Lexi is a social worker who notices this hooded man watching her day after day.
Unless you're a total hearts and flowers romance reader, I do NOT think the ending is that bad.
On a comparative sense, I do not think this book's ending was non-HEA like Blind Obsession by Ella Frank.
Addiction:-The condition of being habitually or compulsively occupied with or or involved in something.Synonyms:	dependency, dependence, craving, habit, weakness, compulsion, fixation, enslavementThis is a story of an addict, of abuse, of hope, of destruction.This is a story of two people being link by hurt, two people desperate to fill the void in their lives.“We’re all addicted to something that takes away the pain.” The characters are damaged both Lexi and Twitch have had a tough life.Their relationship is dysfunctional, colossal mess of hurt, love,lust, anger and yet there is so much more to it.
4.5 RAW Stars ”After all, the good girl always wants the bad boy. Doesn’t she?” Well that was entertaining! I have to say that although there were several plot holes and Twitch’s reasons for stalking and wanting to destroy Lexi were just flat out odd and my reaction was quite frankly this A LOT of the story…I still found this to be a very hot, fast paced read!The story is told in alternate pov which I love and although both characters behavior was cuckoo to me. Truthfully, this stranger was HOT

I want her.
The need to punish her is getting worse.”
Overall, this was a hot fast paced read that I can see Goodreads friends either loving or hating it’s pretty much a toss up!

LIKE OMFG; WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW FURIOUS I AM AT THE MOMENT.I hope their story continues.
Like we still have business to settle.I am so furious, I am actually sobbing because of how ANGRY I am feeling, more than angry, I feel betrayed.
I know I am a hypocrite, wanting authors to have a realistic non-cliche ending, but WHAT THE HELL, I read for those HEAs!!!
PLEASE, I am begging you Belle Aurora.What a well written book, my only problems are a few things left unexplained and the bloody ending.
First of all when I got the message from Belle Aurora about the ARC I flipped my shit because I LOVED Willing Captive.
hehe.Secondly I want to say BRA-fucking-VO to Belle Aurora because this book is NOT a romance and she doesn't pretend that it's one either.
It's a love story, just not the kind with an HEA, so DO NOT EXPECT ONE.
I LOVE TWITCH.
Like Super Love Twitch.
I know the author has no plans on a sequel, but I would like some MORE TWITCH.
There hasn't been a character as unique as him in a long while and I could go for Twitch round 2.
My first thoughts when I finished this were: then I wondered how the eff am I going to review this.....Did I like it? Did I hate it? Do I like the characters? Do I loathe them? Am I happy with the way it ended? Is this book just completely weird?  Twitch is some kind of effed up...I mean CRAZY.....  “Monsters don't always lurk in the shadows. Sometimes they hide in plain sight.”  and he has a little bit of an anger problem. Alexa must be crazy too since she's not creeped out by him being her sta
And then Twitch stops being such a controlling ass and starts turning soft and falling in love with her.
Also I think it will fit in well with my drug dealer boyfriend  (hide spoiler)] oh and (view spoiler)[ Why the fuck did she stop taking her birth control!
Anyways, you will just have to read to find out what happens between them...One plus from this book, NO ONE HAS GRAY EYES!
I was a little bit disappointed with Twitch's reasoning for getting Alexa and thought it could have been better developed.
What else drove my rating down : It always comes back to the heroine not taking enough time to think things through in her head.
Just sayin...Why I still kept reading : I wanted to know how this train wreck could possibly turn out.
What happens when the stalker with an agenda ends up questioning his own agenda?The story itself had something which kept me interested enough to keep reading.
And I already decided in my head what has happened, so I don't want to be told otherwise that this isn't the case.Who should read this book?
So I scrolled down a popular goodreads list - Male Characters You Would Run From If They Tried To Date You. Guess who just made it on Santa's naughty list? Christian Grey's long lost tattooed/pierced twin brother. Girl, you need to run away from that fool. Buy a can of pepper spray. Also, birth control is your friend. The 'hero?' Total whack job. Violent. Abusive. He makes Pablo Escobar look like an angel. The funniest line in this novel:  I’m damn good at my job.  NO YOU'RE NOT. Lexi is suppose

Lexi is supposed to be a registered social worker.
No self-respecting social work organization would admit someone this moronic.~Musings of a daughter whose mother is a social worker.
This book is REALLY messed up.This book really messed ME up.Raw was nowhere near my cup of tea but god was it intriguing. There was some fucked up shit going on but there was just something about this book that kept me going until the end.I didn't condone about 99 percent of the things that were done and happened in this book, and to be honest I'm not even sure if I  LIKED  this book but this was one hell of a train wreck. And I love a train wreck. XDAnd that EPILOGUE...
One I relished and read in a calculative way as to not miss any piece of Lexi and Twitch's story.
Some I will not soon forget and some I hope to read more about *hint… to the author.Even though I sort of knew where the story was going, I enjoyed the entire journey and I especially enjoyed the relationship development between Lexi and Twitch as well as the melting of his cold Grinch-like heart.I think the ending was perfectly selfless and was so fitting for Lexi and Twitch.
I won’t be defined by words like normal, unbalanced, or damaged.
Re-read: 02.11.2016 I think I liked this book more the second time around...yeah, I really think I did. Twitch still does something to my obvious sick heart and while Alexa still annoys me at time, I don't mind her so much because Twitch makes up for it. The story is still sick, devastation, sexy and raw. And wild, even the second time around reading it. I'm also very sure I'll re-read this yet again in the future. Though after hearing a bit about book #2 in this series, I'm not feeling it to c
Though after hearing a bit about book #2 in this series, I'm not feeling it to continue the series...cuz I only want Twitch.
This is probably one of the weirdest and strangest, yet good book that I have ever read.
But I do recommend people to read this because it's something 'completely out of character, mind blowing and crazy shit' kind of book.
so I guess I should just stop writing and just end it with: I really liked the book, but sometimes it was too much for me.Rate: 4/3 *shocking, what the hell did i just read?!* stars.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
And she’s going to pay."-Twitch  (hide spoiler)] He wants Lexi.
There is only one problem that Twitch hasn't prepared for...he falls in love with Lexi.
"Running a hand down my face, I think long and hard about what needs to be done, all the while knowing I won’t ever let her go."-TwitchWhen Lexi is with Twitch, she forgets everything about being good.
The way I know you want it.
Please do not view this spoiler if you don't want to know what happens.
(view spoiler)[I was completely devestated that Lexi tells Twitch she is pregnant and then he is killed.
4--Twitchy--Stars!!! "There's something about Twitch.He's just....raw.Everything about him is raw. And gritty. And unbound.He's a raging fire. And I'm a fragile moth fluttering into the flame. Sooner or later, I'm going to get burned. I know this." Well call me crazy but I liked this one.....a lot. I'm a Belle Aurora fan--I've read all of her books. There's just something quirky and different about her writing and her stories. That's what Raw was for me--quirky and different....much like Willing
That's what Raw was for me--quirky and different....much like Willing Captive.
IDK...for me this one seemed to get hyped as some dark, twisted, mind fuckery of a tale but it wasn't like that for me.
Yes, Twitch I used a label...Overall though I enjoyed the story, the quirkiness of it and the humor in the dialogue.
I wasn't torn up by the ending.Bottom line, I think if you are a fan of Belle Aurora and have read and liked her other books, especially Willing Captive, I think you will like this one.
My emotions during this book: Either I was orthen againorandand in the end I was like What should I say about this book?After reading the blurb and some mixed reviewsI thought I would never come out there alive.
It was emotional, confusing and very intense.
But what I liked the most is how Belle Aurora remained true to herself and managed to create very funny conversations and inner dialogues in this tragic story.And thats the reason why I love her and her books.
Thank you Harriet for staying up very late with me and going through this story together.I would have gone mad without you <3
Not going to rate it as I did not finish and read enough spoilers from reviews that I am glad I did not finish. On another day, it might have worked for me but not this time.
