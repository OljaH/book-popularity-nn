Good fun if you're twelve and think that love excuses everything.
But once you get older, you'll start to realise that this isn't romantic.
This isn't romantic at all.
Including Kyo. Scrub that.
Especially Kyo. I don't care if he loves her.
Black Bird in a nutshell is the head of the Tengu clan named Kyo trying to kill anyone who gets in between him and Misao who is the Senka or the Holy Fruit just to get into her pants.I wouldn't have a problem with this series if Kyo wasn't a controlling, abusive, sex fiend.
I will give Misao credit because she doesn't love him at first and wants nothing to do with him even though he is a handsome man.
It actually sounds like a good story but the problem again is the way Kyo treats Misao.
I swear I've read multiple manga that were 95% the same as this.
Teen girl is special in a way that attracts bad-whatever but gives her no powers.
Also she has no personality aside from being vaguely nice.
Dark-haired guy with supernatural power protects her while being controlling and making unwanted sexual advances.
Kyo was less of an a@@hole than some of these "romantic" leads, but it was just as annoying.
The two were childhood friends so he could have simply taken up the friendship again rather groping her breasts and giving orders.
They could have had a cute romance instead of a generic abuse-excusing fake-tension plot.
The whole premise is that this girl is super-power for demons.
She has no real power to stop the human looking heads of clans that come to marry her.
One of the demons 'loves' her enough that he is protecting her and has not tried to force himself on her physically (much) but he comes out with winning lines like "You can't live without me.
The whole book creates this weird bondage-light vibe where the girl is always getting hurt so the main Demon love interest can lick her better, carry her in his arms, make caveman remarks about how she better hurry up and belong to him, etc.
Shoujo manga is supposed to be read but young girls so basically it's like a Young Adult book but I think the content in this manga is not really appropriate for young girls.
I definitely won't recommend this book to young girls because of the smut and I hate it because some of the volume covers shows that the male MC ties the girl or chokes her, that didn't happen in the actual manga, he's just a perverted asshole but has his sweet side too ...
I guess this is one of those guilty pleasure manga reads ...
3.5 vercem ben buna. Paradise Kiss'ten sonra çizimler gözüme biraz basit göründü ama konu olarak çok sevdim. Hem eğlenceli hem de fantastik bir dünya. Misao canavarları gören bir kız ve onun dışında kimse bu canavarları görmüyor. 16.yaş günü geldiğinde bu canavarlar çoğalıyorlar çünkü Misao'nun kanını istiyorlar. Ve bu noktada karşımıza simsiyah kanatlı kahramanımız Kyo çıkıyor. Karakterler ve diyaloglar çok eğlenceliydi gerçekten. Hemen devam edesim var çünkü neler olacak çok merak ediyorum.Mangalara sarmam hiç iyi olmadı hiç -.-
Para ser la primera vez que leo algo de esta autora me convenció esa mezcla de terror y amor.
Por que vas a encontrar seres malvados que buscan a toda costa alimentarse con la carne de nuestra protagonista.
La historia de amor que existe esta llena de misterio, comedia, y erotismo.
3. Los toques cómicos y dramáticos estuvieron bien para mi.
4. Los gráficos están muy bien logrados.
5. Los amantes de los seres malvados y hombres que se transforman en cuervos, pero además que les gusten los tramas cómico románticos, esta historia les fascinara.
I read the first chapter of this a while back and thought it wasn’t gonna be my thing, but it got recommended to me again the other day so I tried again and now...omg I love it so much 😍I think the art style threw me off the first chapter before but I’m actually really enjoying it now!
Misao, throughout the book, is treated like an object by Kyo, the demon that she's getting married to.
Kyo does claim to love Misao, but it's hard to believe, considering how he treats her, combined with the fact that he has ulterior motives for marrying her.
Misao's love appears to be, by my assessment, not just okay, but Meant To Be.Perhaps it would be unfair to assess this manga mostly based on the central relationship, if it weren't the only focus of the book.
Misao has very little character development outside of it - we know virtually nothing about her except that she sees demons, and that she's in an abusive relationship.
I just had to finish it!
I am ecstatic and cannot wait to buy the second book and read more!Black bird is about a demon boy (a Tengu), Kyo, trying to get the main character, Misao Harada, become his bride so his clan may prosper.
And if he makes her his bride, his clan will prosper..." The plot, the story line, everything about it was great, right down to the drawings!
It drew me in and refused to relinquish it's hold until I was finished.
I want to run to the nearest bookstore and buy a copy of the next book!
Review publishes on 01/18/2018.Fifteen-year-old Misao Harada has been able to see demons since she was a small child.
It doesn’t help that she doesn’t remember much about him from her childhood, such as that he’s a tengu demon and leader of his clan.There is just something so cute and addictive about the characters of BLACK BIRD.
I have an obscene crush on both Kyo and Misao, and Kyo’s six-year-old Tengu servant, Taro, is flat-out adorable.
It was highly entertaining and I plan to continue reading more from the Black Bird series.
Good if you want to put your critical sensibilities into neutral with something trashy" however she criticises the manga with the comment "its creative horizons are that of a bodice ripper.
Don't expect the next modern manga masterpiece." Katherine Dacey, writing for The Manga Critic, criticises Misao for not defending herself even as "demons slash her throat, poison her, push her off rooftops, and slam her against walls." Dacey comments that "younger readers may find [Kyo] sexy, but older readers will see him for what he is: a wolf in knight’s clothing, posing as Misao’s savior while manipulating her for his own selfish interests."Basically how I feel.
Thanks to Kat Stark for her review!For years, I've been looking for this manga ever since an old friend introduced me to the series and it's not because I want to read it again, but because of the soft porn and the silly characters were worth discussing with my sister.
She loves reading manga, so I thought she might have read this, but it didn't jog any memories for her.All in all, Black Bird was definitely one of those guilty-pleasure reads and I only made it up to Vol. 6 before I gave up.
I would never recommend this manga to her, not unless she wants to read it so we can both make fun of it together.That's what sisters are for.
This will definitely be an interesting series. I’m intrigued by the storyline and I do enjoy some aspects of the plot, but there are other parts that annoy me to no end.I do want to continue to see what happens though, so we’ll see!
Şu sıralar canım arkadaşım Şeymoş sayesinde ciddi ciddi Mangalara takmış durumdayım.İlk okuduğum Shoujo bitince, önerilere bir bakayım dedim ve çoğunluk Black Bird'ın hem romantik tarzda hem de fantastik bir evren üzerine kurulu olduğunu söyleyince kaçırmadım açıkçası.Zerre manga ve anime kültürü olmayan bir insanım. Bu yüzden karşılaştıracağım bir benzeri yok manganın.Okuması keyif veren, komediyi romantizmi gerektiği yer de devreye sokup aksiyonu bol bir manga( Shoujo'da olabilir bilmiyorum) okumak isterseniz Black Bird'ü başlangıç olarak önerebilirim.Okurken çok keyif alıyorum ve devamını okumak için sabırsızlanıyorum açıkçası. Ah bir de not düşeyim ; ANA KARAKTER BEYİN KANATLARI VAR , HEM DE SİYAH ! *_*
A smuttier version of Twilight, where an abusive relationship is justified under the pretense of one party being supernatural.
The heroine is defined by her frail human weaknesses; she's attractive only because of a deus ex machina whereby she's the "Bride of Prosperity" or some nonsense like that, which makes her irresistible to monsters in a raping, flesh eating sort of way.
Her love interest constantly forces himself on her, but because he doesn't have sex with her, it's okay.
His ability to restrain himself from raping her is a sign of his intense love.
Possibly the least enjoyable manga I've ever read.
Un manga con escenas de sexo y sangre.
Interesting start to the series. The classic two-guys-fighting-over-a-girl with a bit of extra panache...
Amanda, RUN AWAY.
If you don't think any of this shit is bad enough to make you want to throw the book against the wall or use it to lighten fires and dance around them while shouting that this book is shit to the sky, then please do know that there's more.
While she tells him over and over to not fucking touch her and stay the fuck away.
Tells her he's going to assault her as much as he can once he gets rid of competition and stupid bullshit like that.
She warned me to stay away, but I said how bad could it be?
Ne desem ne demesem inanın bilemiyorum. Yeni bir seri arayışı içindeydim, bu seriyi gördüğümde bir şans vermek ve şansımı denemek istedim. Tanıdığım, takip ettiğim kimsenin yorum ve referansına rastlamadığım için bir nevi bilinmezdi benim için ama... İşte o ama var ya... Bir kere çizimler tam istediğim gibi çok iyi ve kaliteliydi. Manga-kanın ellerine sağlık diyelim. İkinci olarak kurgu şimdiye kadar okuduğum mangalardan daha farklıydı. Sadece Misao'nun gördüğü canavarlar var ve bu canavarlar

Yeni bir seri arayışı içindeydim, bu seriyi gördüğümde bir şans vermek ve şansımı denemek istedim.
Tanıdığım, takip ettiğim kimsenin yorum ve referansına rastlamadığım için bir nevi bilinmezdi benim için ama...
İşte o ama var ya...
Bir kere çizimler tam istediğim gibi çok iyi ve kaliteliydi.
Manga-kanın ellerine sağlık diyelim.
İkinci olarak kurgu şimdiye kadar okuduğum mangalardan daha farklıydı.
Sadece Misao'nun gördüğü canavarlar var ve bu canavarlar Misao'ya musallat oluyor.
Ve Kyo...
Ah Kyo'm benim.
Ben bu çocuğu çok sevdim yav!
Simsiyah kanatları bir açılıyor ki.Ay Kyo'cuğum birde kendini Misao'nun kocası ilan etmesin mi!
Misao is a girl who can see creatures that no one else can, as long as she can remember she has thes
Every time I see that a new volume is out I have to get it and read it soon after!
It's perverted- but sweet at the same time that you just have to love it...Misao Harada is your average teenage girl- only she is the legendary Senka Maiden and demons from all over want 1.
to make her their bride.
And to make matters even worse her best friend from her childhood, her first love who moved away 10 years earlier, turns out to be a demon and he's come to fulfill his promise: to make Misao his bride.
Oh wow I loved this!Read in one sitting.Demons and hot devils. Addicted!!
Of course Kyo and Misao are meant to be, but aren't there any other decent beings. I'll have to wait and see in the following volumes- this is, after all, only the first one 😅😁
And it doesn’t help I’m reading at least three other manga with this same plot (though mostly sans the romance).Misao Harada can see spirits.
Sure enough, she gets attacked by spirits and she is saved by Kyo, her childhood friend.It turns out that he’s a tengu, a spirit, who can heal her wounds with his tongue (okay now we all know why I bought this).
The rest of the manga is her getting attacked, Kyo having to save her or his competition a Kitsune, does.
Kyo is an interesting character but Harada does nothing for me so I’m probably not going further with this one.
I’ll only do individual reviews for a series when it has 5 volumes or less or I've received a copy in exchange for an honest review.Black Bird ended up just being an okay series for me that I think could have been told in less than 18 volumes.
There was a lot of potential with the demon and senka maiden mythology, but it just never quite lived up to my expectations.
I liked the demon clans.
It never really goes anywhere and the ending was a let down.
Well every time I went into the bookstore and I drifted toward the back where they keep the manga or as they call them graphic novels.
So after reading normal fiction with a paranormal edge.
I decided I wanted to read a manga and since it was also paranormal, I picked it up.
Which is crucial in how much I like a any series, whether it be manga or normal fiction.
In fact after I finished reading this volume, I went and looked up  tengu , which is like a Japanese bird/human hybrid demon.So in conclusion.
I have found yet another series that I will be adding to my reading list.
Plot: Although I feel like I have read something similar to this before, Black Bird definitely kept my attention.
I absolutely loved that Sakurakoji mixes bits of violence, romance, and Japanese folk lore into this novel creating something that feels both authentic and fictional at the same time.
The details of the novel are slowly revealed which allowed me to get to know the characters and understand each person's role in the overall story.Characters: Black Bird has a TON of characters.
But what I loved most was that I did not feel overpowered by them.
worst book ever when i got later into the series it was exactly like twilight heres how and the main character is just like bella a totally selfish person!
she is such a selfish person if she didn't exist so much could be saves to make this series great the beginning was fine but after that it was the whole twilight i cant live without you seeing you everyday safe and healthy isn't enough i ned to touch you.
I'm not one to reivew manga, although I'm a manga crazed person.
I live, breath and draw manga, but for some reason this one wasn't up to par as some of the others I have read.
The artwork is pretty enough, but I felt like I could have been reading a manga like version of Twilight, except with demons.
Maybe there will be more to it...I've only read the 1st volume, and lately I haven't been in the mood for manga...sad I know.
I'm not gonna give up entirely on this series, but so far, I'm not impressed one or another.
