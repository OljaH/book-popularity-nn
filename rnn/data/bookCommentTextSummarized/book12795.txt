May, 2012 Update Read this last May and had to read it again for 2012! Loved it! With all the recordings of less-than-desirable books from the 80's & 90's, why can't they put this one on audio? ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Five full stars! It has been 21 years since I last read Duncan‚Äôs Bride and it is still holds up to the ravishes of time and my fickle changes in reading material. I love Linda Howard at her best and I found her here in this quick-read of a Silhouette Intimate Moments publication. Ms. Howard has
I love Linda Howard at her best and I found her here in this quick-read of a Silhouette Intimate Moments publication.
I want it stopped right now.‚Äù‚ÄúThe routine or the scraping?‚Äù‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù‚ÄúThe house can‚Äôt be painted until the old paint is scraped off,‚Äù she said reasonably.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford the paint, so it doesn‚Äôt make any difference.
What does it take to make you understand that?‚ÄùYes, Reese Duncan is a ‚Äúbold and arrogant and quick-tempered‚Äù Montana rancher, but Madelyn Patterson is just the New Yorker to calm him down while conversely stirring his blood to fever pitch.
Reese is determined not to give his heart a second time and Madelyn is just as determined to win it.
The scene in the pick-up truck.That is all.
3.5 stars.Did a re-read... think it might drop a half star for me. He was a bit of a jerk. She was a bit too naive! Still a good read though. But my reading tastes have definitely changed over the years.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I love anything by Linda. Serious, Gruff Hero who eventually succumbs to the love of a good woman. Need to get more of her older stuff out on Kindle. Thanks Jenna for the book.
Este libro lo le√≠ hace mil a√±os (mi madre es fan de la autora y tiene muchos de sus libros) y estuve una √©poca preguntando por √©l pues no recordaba el t√≠tulo, pero si la trama, que me gust√≥ mucho en su momento.
Sus protagonistas son todo un clich√© y algo machistas (la √©poca en que est√° escrita tiene gran parte de culpa) y un buen ejemplo de lo que le gusta a la autora (machos alfa cabezones y protagonistas de armas tomar), pero la qu√≠mica entre ellos es bestial (esa camioneeeeta) y narra de forma muy realista lo dura que es la vida en un rancho.
Reece Duncan is a Montana rancher hard on finances and time.
This time, Reece was going to advertise for a woman built to withstand labour and the expectations of living on a ranch.
When Madelyn answers Reece's ad for a wife in the country papers, she doesn't seriously consider it working out.
But I loved seeing her reaction to Reece, in all his alpha-male, masculine glory.
I loved how Maddie finally decided to do something drastic.
I'm also very interested in knowing more about Robert Cannon, Maddie's step-brother!
He intrigued me with his mysterious ways and I'm so excited about his book, Loving Evangeline.
She literally saved his ass and got him out of the crap house he was in and he all he kept repeating was  This is my place, you get no say in it," and "I choose what I want to do with it." Really!!?After everything that happened and with her saving your sorry excuse of a human being, you go and treat her like absolute garbage?
Sorry to say this but the hit and miss sex combined with the treatment of a house slave and the whole it's mine and I am the boss, really had me wanting to call a hit on him.
Reese Duncan is the quintessential Howard hero.........
However, Duncan's Bride stands out to me NOT because of the hero, but because of the heroine.
Madelyn is everything that I love my heroines to be.
The ability to draw the reader in is one of Howard's biggest gifts, and in Duncan's Bride.....
Madelyn is EXACTLY what Reese needs.
Madelyn is all warmth, laughter, hope, and love.
Slowly she teaches Reese how to love and trust once more.
It takes some time...he's a stubborn man.....but the payoff at the end is worth everything.
Kudos to this book because it's set back in the 80's and it mentions electric typewriters and people still communicate via mail. Lol. But I've NEVER been so upset with a book character before!!! EVER!!! Reese was so stubborn. Ugh. Nevertheless, this was an adorable book!! I. Must. Read. The. Follow up.
KNOCKED OUT!This is a 5++++++++++++++ rating book.Absolutely wonderful awesome heart warming emotion
Madelyn, her reactions as well as her actions to Reese and her circumstances are the primary reasons to read this.
Reese and Madelyn are both poleaxed by their visceral reaction to each other.
(hide spoiler)]Madelyn handles Reese the way I wish I could have handled my exes and my current guy aka my husband.
Smart girl.There are some great secondary characters; namely Floris the hatchet faced owner of the diner.My only regret is that when Madelyn finds out how bad April, the ex, took Reese, she tells her cool and probably somewhat evil step-brother to ruin them.
Madelyn just makes this book.
I didn‚Äôt want to stop reading.I liked the audiobook better than the physical book due to the narrator‚Äôs wonderful interpretations.BACKSTORY:Reese was wealthy land owner/rancher in Montana.
It is lust at first sight for both of them, but Reese does not want to marry her because he thinks Maddie will be like Alice.
But no one else suitable responds to the ad, so Reese marries Maddie.
Reese then limits his emotions for Maddie due to his past relationship fears.AUDIOBOOK AND NARRATOR:I read the physical book several years ago and just now listened to the audiobook.
Duncan's Bride is sexy, sassy, a real page turner, it's all the things I've come to expect from Linda Howard.Reese Duncan wants a wife but not for love or any of those sappy reasons.
He has a strong sex drive, he wants children and a strong woman willing to help him rebuild his ranch.
His lack of choices, her determination and her sex appeal win her the job and they marry.All of the above takes place right away and the remainder of the book is spent watching Maddie prove to Reese that all woman aren't like his ex-wife.

#retorita2 #RitaHoward Libro sencillo y entretenido, que se lee en un suspiro. Me ha gustado mucho, y tambi√©n me gusta como escribe la autora. √âl a veces saca de quicio por su car√°cter, puede ser muy croma√±on en ciertas situsciones, üòÇpero se llega a entender por que act√∫a as√≠ y ella tiene m√°s paciencia que un Santo y car√°cter. Seguir√© leyendo m√°s de esta escritora
I‚Äôve read a lot of romantic mysteries written by her and sufficiently enough I could say that she has this way of turning a simple plot into marvelous one thru her characters which I find exceptionally compelling.‚ÄúDuncan‚Äôs Bride is the story of how Madelyn fought Reese‚Äôs bitterness, his lack of trust and of how she finally managed to make him see that home is many things, but the home represented by LOVE and family is far more important than the home constructed of four walls.‚ÄùFavorite lines:*‚ÄúNever run if you can walk.
Un ranchero pone un anuncio para buscar esposa y una mujer a la que no le hace falta nada, su hermanastro est√° forrado, responde, se sube a un avi√≥n, lo ve y siente atracci√≥n inmediata, pasa una tarde con √©l, intercambian dos frases, se besan una vez y ella ya se declara enamorada y acepta casarse con √©l y abandonar todo lo que conoce para irse con un completo extra√±o.
De la cabezoner√≠a de Reese y de la paciencia de Maddie.Por otro lado, sobre el final debo decir que me pareci√≥ todo muy color de rosa.
I was initially impressed with the writing style and the happy-go-lucky type h, She was strong, stubborn and has her mind set on all good things, I was jealous of the H's ex-wife myself, I expected the h to be aswell instead she felt sorry that he could not move on.
His Broken-soul character was really good in the beginning, but being the same thing till the end sucks especially when he had such an angel like h beside, mending him.
***FIVE STARS***What an adorably charming story.
I loved Reese, with his scarred, emotional distrust of women that kept him from moving forward with his life, vowing never to be royally fucked over ever again.
And Maddy was adorable and so full of personality.
She was so supportive to Reese trying to pull him through his mistrust, always keeping this amazing wit about her as well.
The drama in this story was delicious too.
And the sex!!
This story has some of the steamiest sex scenes I have ever read.
This story had it all: Great characters, great story, great sex, and the perfect ending!
I loved this book. I loved the message about carrying emotional baggage from one relationship to the other. Reese was an alpha male in every sense of the word. Maddie was a strong and intelligent woman who made Reese really think about whether or not he was willing to lose her. I loved Maddie's character and I actually liked Reese's character also. It was nice to watch their passionate love story unfold before your very eyes. I've already re-read this book twice in a span of 2 days.
3,5Me encantan estas novelas, disfruto como una loca. Ay Reese, qu√© gran ranchero!
Bueno, vale, al final me ha gustado xDLe√≠do dentro del #RetoRita #RitaHoward #LindaHoward Una historia f√°cil, sencilla, para toda la familia, con un ranchero y una chica de ciudad. Personitas normales con problemas normales y temperamentos normales, coherentes y con personalidad. Ha estado bien, a pesar de mis renuencias por el car√°cter tan primitivo del vaquero. Lo recomiendo :)
Historia bonita, pero tan cortita, que me ha sabido a poco.
4.5 stars for the audiobook. The narrator really captured the heroine.
There are others thrown in sometimes- and I wasn't sure the story would be able to survive based off only them and the ranch.
In fact- I wasn't drawn into the story at first- until Maddie became ensconced into Reese's life on the ranch.Reese is an off-putting, sexy, brute of a man, with lingering anger/rage flowing through his veins, thanks to his ex-wife.
His ill temper would have been enough to say: peace out sucker!However, Maddie falls for him from the very start, and as the story goes along we see what a strong willed person she can be.
3.5* Grade BI enjoyed this over-the-top contemporary romance with the alpha-male Reece and superwoman Maddie.
I loved the banter, especially when they did the "top this strange fact" game.
Of course, Reece was an idiot, and Maddie was likeable, but not very believable.
I mean, how many people who've never done it can pluck and butcher a chicken without help or instruction?
And she happens to be a stellar cook of good old fashioned farm food, mends, cleans and...wait for it....
All that and multiple orgasms with super-stud cowboy...I want to be Maddie when I grow up!!Unbelievable but sexy and fun.
I really like this book.
I love the mail order bride theme.
The characterization of both the hero and the heroine are very full and complete.
LH is a prime example of showing not telling.
By the actions and words of the characters you know who they are.
Reece is embittered and needs Maddie to help him live again.
Maddie is a very different character.
I love the way she seems to stroll through life while really getting a lot of stuff done.
Her calm nonchalant character is very different from most romantic heroines.
Just a good solid romance with no wrong notes.
This is an old style Harlequin that was originally published back in the late 80's early 90's. Although the Hero could be a bit of a pig at times I still liked him, and I really liked the heroine who had a bit of grit and refused to take a lot of his behaviour and stood up for herself.
3.5 stars rounded upDuring Howard-fest-month last year (thank you, Kathy), I didn't bother with Duncan's Bride - uber-Alpha-male orders mail-order bride around? So not me. Well, big mistake. Big. Huge.Let's hear it for the mail-order bride with a mind of her own. And a few extra cheers for her getting her good-humoured way without making it into a battle of the sexes.
