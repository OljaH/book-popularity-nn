Practically no one else in the story has similar powers.But you know, she never feels like a Mary Sue. I guess her cute yearning for cars, high school, lockers, television and all the other little quirks to her personality give her a rounded character.I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Evie and Lend.
There’s also that rare feeling that I have when I read novels, that these two could actually make it.
They really make a lovely couple.Unlike some people…Anita and Jean Claude know how to have a good time together… no really!The plot and pacing move nicely throughout the story and whilst it was easy to guess who the bad guy was and what the eventual outcome would be, it didn’t annoy me like it has in other novels.
I love, love,  love,  this book. I've read it on and off for the last ten years and every time I pick it up, I literally (yes, literally) laugh out loud.  Tasers are a one-size-fits-all paranormal butt-kicking option. Mine’s pink with rhinestones.  I adore the premise, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) humor scattered throughout and the heroine is easily one of my YA faves. Evie sees through glamors. No one can hide from her.  From when she was discovered (at three) to now, she's been under the thu
When she's not rounding up the wild paranormals, she's watching Easten Heights (her absolute fave drama), online shopping (though most of the purchases get canceled by the government) and hanging out with her best friend (a mermaid).When a suspicious paranormal shows up in the midst of a crisis Evie will have to figure out A) What's killing off the paranormals, B) How to stop her creepy ex-boyfriend (a faerie) from stalking her and C) If the suspicious-slash-hot new guy has a girlfriend.
My heart skipped a beat - he liked me, too!"You're worried about what's killing the paranormals aren't you?"Crap.
Things get a little dicey when all sorts of paranormals are being killed, the Center is invaded, and some faeries are being total douchebags.
(view spoiler)[The moment Evie looks, sees a sign for the prom, and then Lend asks her (hide spoiler)] Fun, sure, but I was perfectly happy with the natural pacing of the relationship--I was glad it wasn't going into trite YA foreverlove territory, and it still didn't...but it did get a little cheesified.Kiersten White has a great sense of humor.
I do not have the patience to read a book where the heroine talks like this:"Oh bleep! I'm so pumped! He kissed me! It was the best kiss of my life! It's such a cool kiss!" Oh bleep?Oh bleep?I'm out.
(Young adult genre + supernatural creatures) x love triangle - originality = De ja bloody vuWhy even bother reading this book? I can point you towards hundreds of other young adult books that are more or less exactly the same as what you get from Paranormalcy. I keep going back to this kind of genre, hoping that just once I will find the exception to the current book cloning rule that seems to be taking over the 21st century. We have a heroine who is neither good or bad enough to be exciting, s
(Young adult genre + supernatural creatures) x love triangle - originality = De ja bloody vuWhy even bother reading this book?
I thought the only people who named their guns were cops caught in a mid-life crisis.
It seems that most young adult authors don't know how not to put a love triangle in their books.
Lend is quite a cute character and my favourite of the pair; mostly because, wait for this, Reth repeatedly attempted some kind of supernatural rape thing - not good at all.
As the tale progresses, Evie's professional duties begin to conflict with her growing desire for a normal life.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: نوزدهم ماه جولای سال 2014 میلایعنوان: اوی در سرزمین خون آشامها؛ نویسنده: کیرستن (کرستن) وایت؛ مترجم: مونا حسینی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، نشر قطره، 1390، در 312 ص، اندازه 20 در 14 س.م.، شابک: 9786001192364؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، گیسا، 1393؛ در 312 ص؛ شابک: 9786006885551؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان آمریکایی برای نوجوانان، سده 21 ماین داستان، روایت زندگی دختر شانزده ساله ‌ای به نام: «اِوی» ست.

She kicks serious butt and can take down a gaggle of vamps without a second thought.
- Evie's fascination with lockers was cute and funny.- There were some really clever lines in this book.
But somewhere along the line, she just began to grind my gears and wasn't cute anymore.
LK#(*&%(T~~!!!!- The villain wasn't scary.- The weird, hokey ending with the floating and the souls and the WTF.This book may appeal to many people and apparently has.
If you like cutesy books with happy little rainbow endings, by all means, help yourself.
Being dead wasn't supposed to hurt. Where was the fairness in that? If I was dead, the least the universe could do was make it painless. This novel was actually awfully written but the plot was funny, and so was the main character. I mean, I'm sure Kiersten's writing has improved and the only reason I picked this one up is because I wanted to see how her writing is/was. I'm sure the other 2 books are much better and now that And I Darken is almost published, I'm sure that one will have much mor
We always get introduced to the main female and male character but then some other male character is introduced and well, that's where the love triangles is sensed.
What I mean is, Evie falls for Lend and spends time with him while her ex, Reth (a faerie) tries to win her heart back, touch her, make her his and blah blah blah all that.
The only reason why I sense a love triangle was because I thought she would go back to Reth, since she was talking to Lend and becoming his friend while she was thinking about Reth.The plot was hard to get at first.
10/27/17 - HEY, GUESS WHAT? I don’t know why or for how long, but this book is currently FREE on Amazon: http://amzn.to/2zUAZh4US Amazon. I don’t know about the rest of them. 📚😘
Let me start by saying that I didn't hate this book, but I also didn't love it either.
All this time I've been calling it "A la Bella-esque." Evie is most defiantly a Mary Sue. And I've come to the realization that I had a love/hate relationship with Evie the entire book.
I thought she was really funny and down right silly at times.
BUT at the same time she annoyed me with being so cheerful with her love of all things pink.
I did find a few things I liked about the book.
Also, I did find the book really funny.
Paranormalcy has it all: romance, adventure, suspense. This book made me laugh out loud and cry. Evie is an amazing character with a fabulous, authentic voice. I want to watch girly tv with her (and of course battle evil right after!)
I'll admit it, I was lured into reading this one due to the oh so lovely cover as I'm a huge sucker for pink.
Nevertheless, the books within this YA paranormal genre are no longer up to par.
This book is about as sexy and "scary" as "The Little Mermaid, and let's face it, "The Little Mermaid" was much more humorous.
As I mentioned, this book lacked humor, I didn't laugh once, not even an internal chuckle.
Now I know what you're thinking, you can't believe that a book lacking in maturity or humor couldn't at least boast of having a hottie.
I wrote a longer review of Paranormalcy back in 2010.
At the time, I had just started my book-review blog, and this was one of the first ARCs I ever received.
So I think there was a lot to originally endear me to the story, and it was definitely light, cute, and a quick read.But then I tried to read the sequel, and I subsequently discovered that "light" and "cute" books just didn't hold my interest anymore.
So in retrospect, I have to remove Paranormalcy from my 'Favorites' shelf.
I'm usually very fastidious when it comes to finding heroines that I like, but Evie was actually really nice.She may have had a couple of blonde moments towards the end (no offense to blondes, of course - my mother is actually blonde) but I still think she was fierce, fun, refreshing, and insecure in a way that I found quite endearing.
To be blunt, she wasn't stupid (like some heroines I won't mention here *cough*Ever*cough*).(view spoiler)[Although there was one thing that she could've done differently: I wanted her to kill—or at least find some thorough way to get ride of—her sister.
I mean with an intro like this how can you not want to read the rest:“Wait- did you-- You just yawned!” The vampire’s arms , raised over his head in the classic Dracula pose, dropped to his sides.
I think for a book described as a paranormal, I was expecting something a little more serious...
I think that’s why I liked it so much, it is definitely different.Evie was such a great character.
I think that made her character memorable.
The prophecy thing....
A paranormal that is funny, engrossing and memorable....
it can only mean one thing....
I just don't know what it is with me and 3 star reviews now...  It's all i seem to be doing lately. What can i say about this one? Well, for starters it wasn't that remarkable, and it started getting predictable. And that was a no-no for me. Nothing about the book was memorable.  It felt like i was reading and reading to get nowhere at all at the end. And that was the cherry on top to a totally average (maybe even below) read. The ending was a total wtf.
You mean to tell me not one single PN was immune to a measly stun gun??
I think this was the first book that I've read where the paranormals were extremely lame and so unimpressive.
I mean, they let themselves get caught by a 16 year old girl with a stun gun who admittedly does not work out!!!
There was someone else I liked but I couldn't read the name I wrote in my notes (and I already returned the book)!
I still don't know about Reth.And the cover lies!
It's light and campy (not a bad thing, but the cover lies!)
I loved how she gets excited for the smallest things - like lockers - and we get to see her take in the real world.
However, it doesn't change the fact that she longs for a boyfriend like on her favourite show, and wishes she could just go to real high school prom.Evie soon meets a very intriguing love interest, Lend.
His relationship with Evie is not instant either, it progresses at a great pace where you can see and feel their attraction grow.
I enjoy love triangles as much as the next, but sometimes it's nice to get a change of pace.As for the plot, it's just plain fun!
Paranormalcy definitely was a cute little book.
It was entertaining, funny and a little romantic at times – but, honestly, while I enjoyed it, it didn’t really make a lasting impression on me.
Her obsession with her pink rhinestone taser ‘Tasey’ (something that had me very suspicious at the beginning) actually didn’t bother me that much.
It was kind of cute.
All in all, I liked it, but it just wasn’t that big a thing for me.
But I can’t say that I’m dying to get my hands on it, and with all the great books coming out all the time, I might forget about it until September …
Aprilynne Pike wrote in her blurb "...One won Evie's heart and the other won mine." I enjoyed Mrs. Pikes debut well enough to rate it three stars, but after this disclosure of her bad taste in evil guys I will be very wary of books to come).After reading her story I can even understand Evie's girlish preference for pink, sparkling clothes and tasers and her motivation to give her Taser and her knife pet names: Since she turned eight she has been living underground, held like a dumb princess in an ivory tower, fed with only the information necessary to tag and bag random paranormals for the International Paranormal Containment Agency that is her "home" and shamelessly uses her unique gift of seeing beyond every kind of magic glamour.
Paranormalcy is a fun, flirty, addictive read with a great paranormal twist.
She has a great best friend who's a mermaid, an ex boyfriend who's a fairy, and will stop at nothing to win her back, a hot shape shifter who can give her everything she's wanted and oh yeah, she's a one of kind paranormal.Everything changes for Evie when she meets Lend, a shapeshifter who may be the one person who can relate to her and understand her.
Lend the hot shape shifter or Reth, the hot, bad tempered fairy who wants Evie back.I love Paranormalcy's rich world building and memorable characters.
I read this book because I was positive I wasn't going to like it.
When I think about this book I see a cute fuzzy pink bunny.Evie was pretty likable, but a bit too quirky in a cool way for somebody who basically lived in a modern version of a cave pretty much all her life.
He's creepy, I hated his crap about wanting to fill Evie (seriously, try saying that out loud with a straight face to someone) and I hope his 'new' name will be something in the lines of Paco, or some other typical pimp name.
This is kinda like a cross between Buffy and The Mortal Instruments series.Despite the girl on the cover, I couldn't help but picture Sarah Michelle Gellar in the role (younger though, considering Evie is just 16).
And if you like said vampire slaying goddess, you will love Evie (who job doesn't involve slaying per se, just containment).She also has eyebrow envy like Clary from the Mortal Instruments.
Not near as much so as Buffy or Mortal Instruments, but reminiscent of both (some might say copycat).
But she’s a teen, so she has teen concerns like forging an identity for herself, getting motivated to do school work, wondering if she’ll ever meet a boy, and trying to figure out what “normal” life is.Evie’s best friend is a mermaid who runs the command centre at IPCA and they communicate through a translator of some kind.
When people important to her IPCA life are killed, she seems to barely register these deaths, but instead concentrates on prom dresses and whether her boyfriend actually likes her.
And really that is the most important thing in a book at the moment.Paranormalcy was a fun and cute read that I found myself smiling the whole way through.
I thought his paranormal talent was unique and sometimes kind of freaky.
I thought the romance was super cute, moved at a nice pace and didn’t overtake the story.
The only thing that I didn’t like about this book was Reth.
However this book won’t be for everyone it might be a bit annoying and cutesy for some of my Bookers friends since she does have a pink bedazzled taser named tasey!
I honestly have not read anything like this.
This just rocked!I’m afraid to write a summary, I don’t want to give one single thing about this one away for any of you who haven’t read it!!!!
Yay, for books without absent parents!This thing gave me Fairies, Werewolf’s, Vampires, Shape shifters, Paranormal’s, mermaids, mere-humans, Hags, water sprites….
I want to know what Lend looks like!Book #2???
well, unless it's cupcakes and only then will I make an exception!!!Replace kid with book, you get my point
Definitely what comes to mind when I think of Evie and her story.My Thoughts:I have been longing to read Paranormalcy since I first heard about, so naturally, I stalked my mailman when I found out I would be getting my very own copy.Evie, the main character, is quite possibly the strongest heroine I have ever read.
Evie is clever, sarcastic, hilarious, flirtatious, lovable, and altogether awesome!Paranormalcy isn’s strictly about vampires or werewolves or faeries.
Sure, I could guess a twist here, the effect of some action there, but multiple times, I was utterly stumped.What we get with Paranormalcy is the perfect debut book and I only see this series getting better.The Blurb:Dark and sexy, flirtatious and fun.
Paranormalcy is a refreshingly well written coming of age story about a sheltered teenage girl who just happens to live in a world filled with vamps, weres and other supernatural beasts.
You say that sounds just like every other YA book written these days?
;)Actually, Paranormalcy is very much like other UF/PNR novels these days.
Hopefully Evie will mature and grow a little in the books to come.
Even though I really, really want to give this four stars, it seems only right to hold out for the second book and see where that goes.
It was really the only time in the last year I've spent immersed in YA that I've not been able to identify with a main character, simply because I felt so much older and more mature than her.Anyway, beyond Evie feeling a bit immature--exactly as immature as a sixteen year old should be--I thought Paranormalcy was very well done.
I understand there is a bit of Team Reth/Team Lend going on and I have to say I don't get it.
We didn't know his motivation throughout most of the book, only that what he was doing was against Evie's will and this homie never plays that.
It also seems remarkably fitting for Evie, the main character, who is also shiny and pretty.
This books was one wild ride after another with Evie .Now, while Evie got into a lot of dark, action-packed scrapes, it still felt fairly light to me because of the humorous voice.
It was such an original, clever premise, which seems pretty amazing to me considering it was packed full of paranormal creatures that have been written into stories for ages.
And a little bizarre, all things considered, but that’s part of what makes it so cool (I’d like to explain, but you’d hate me for giving away one of the most rockin aspects of this book).
