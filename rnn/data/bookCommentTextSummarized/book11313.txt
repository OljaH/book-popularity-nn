And so I read this book as a child, and yet I never aimed high enough to want to marry a prince.
And then there were those mothers who wanted us to marry doctors or lawyers.Me, I just wanted a handsome man.
I wanted a cowboy, but I didn’t know that then, so I married my high school sweetheart who was an American Indian.
Then there is that saying, “Mamas don’t let your girls to grow up to be cowgirls.”As for me, I met the man that I wanted, and we have been married for 30 years.
This fairy tale has always been one of my favourites. I always admire the imagination used in this tale. Really impressive! I had watched it before and I really. enjoyed after reading it today.(^_^)
One of the best fairy tales. Everyone should read these stories as a child.I've watched its animated series as well. The way Cinderella's mother pronounces her name has always cracked me up.
I love this book so much! This book really made me feel like a princess!!!!
حلم كل فتاة ان تصبح سندريلا يأتيها فارس احلامها ^^قصة جميلة اُحِبُهَا ^^
Pepeljuga je jedna cura koja je htjela ići na bal no maćeha joj nije dala. Na kraju se udala sa princa. Ovo je najbolja knjiga gdje uvijek dobro pobjeđuje zlo.
I bought this for my almost-4-year-old niece.
She absolutely loves to read pictures!
This book was really well done.
It goes through the whole movie and does not leave huge details out.
Although she has not seen the movie yet, she absolutely loved the book.
There's nothing like seeing a child smile.
"Cinderella" allows young girls to see that no matter where you come from or how bad life is, there is always a bright light waiting for you ahead.
Till she grows old enough to understand this, I guess, she will enjoy the big ball gowns, glass slippers and other fairy-tale elements.
Cinderella is a book written by the Walt Disney Company about a young lady repressed by her stepmother and stepsisters.
Throughout the story, her stepmother kept her from having a life similar to the other girls her age.
The fairy godmother is a sweet looking older lady who comes to help Cinderella in her time of need.
When a letter came in the mail from the king asking for all the young women to come to his dance, she was overjoyed and asked her stepmother if she'd able to go.
When he placed the slipper on Cinderella's foot, it fit perfectly.
First of all, do you have any idea how many people have the same size foot?
It allows young girls to see that no matter where you come from or how bad life is, there is always a bright light waiting for you ahead.
This book not only gives the readers something to look forward to because they want Cinderella to have a happy ending, but it also allows them to see how not to treat people as example by the step mother.
Your fairy god mother could be anyone in your life that promotes you and makes you feel special.
My most favorite fairy tale. <3Its every girl's dream to be a princess or treated as a princess ^_^

This book is a written version of the popular Disney movie Cinderella.
It is a beautiful book with stunning illustrations of the movie throughout which really bring the story to life.
Cinderella transforms into a beautiful princess that meets her prince charming.
It would be interesting to discuss with the class the elements of a fairytale before and after the story.
Hotseating would also be an interesting activity to do for different characters within the story.
It might provide young girls with the common misconception that the only way to be truly happy in life is to have a 'prince charming'.

3. Cinderella might be my favorite fairy tale.
It is a classic fairy tale; the girl is beautiful but she is held back by the evil step-mother.
Eventually the fairy godmother steps in and helps her make it to the place where she meets her Prince Charming.
Based on the 1950 Disney movie (which was itself based on elements of both Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm's versions of the fairy tale), Cinderella is a barebones account of the all-to-familiar story: a man dies, leaving his beautiful daughter in the hands of the wicked stepmother and stepsisters, treating her as their slave and refusing to allow her to attend a royal ball until all her work is done.
In traditional fashion, the daughter relies on her fairy godmother to provide a beautiful ball gown and transportation to the ball and her animal friends to help her escape her room in order to prove that she is the owner of the lost glass slipper.
It is a retold of the story of Cinderella based on the classical film from Walt Disney Studios.

Unfortunately, Ella's father passes away and from that moment her life changes.
Ella becomes the servant of the house and her step family calls her Cinderella.
The family is invited to a royal ball, but Cinderella's dress gets destroyed by her step family and she is unable to go.
The book contains pictures of the recent Cinderella film from Walt Disney Studios.
This version of Cinderella by Walt Disney's Company is Cinderella in one of its simplest forms.

Unfortunately they do not let Cinderella join them, and they destroy her dress.
Before the end of the ball, Cinderella's fairy god mother fixed her appearance with a new dress, coach, coachman, footman, and horses.
Cinderella goes to the ball, where the prince falls in love with her.
Here is where his search for Cinderella begins.
Each double page spread is filled with pictures from Walt Disney's famous movie "Cinderella."
The most famous Cinderella is a story about a young girl and her evil step mother.

I loved this book because of the illustrations that represent the whole story.
Those traits are magical to find in one person and Cinderella accomplishes that.
I loved the characters in this story and all the themes that go with it.
It is truly a magical story that fits all children.
When I read this story to children, I will enforce the magic that is in this story along with the kindness coming from Cinderella.

This book was really well done. I really enjoyed it. It goes through the whole movie and doesn't leave huge details out. The pictures are all amazing and look like the movie. The only thing that could have made it better was if there were more details and more parts of the movie in the story. Not everything from the movie was included and I think the author left out some of the parts that should have remained in the story. Overall though the book was very good and definitely a good read for fans of Cinderella.
1. None.2. Pre k- 1st grade.3. Cinderella is treated horribly by her stepmother and stepsisters, yet she remains kind. With the help of her fairyGod mother, she is able to have one magical night out. All she has to do is make it back before midnight. 4. This book and movie is a true classic. It is my favorite fairytale and always will be. It allows the opportunity to introduce character traits and to discuss them. 5. Create a character sketch for one of the characters in the story. Discuss elements of a fairytale before and after reading the story.
I think that this is the book I read, though the two covers shown are not like the one I have. Of course, in such a severely condensed form the Cinderella experience is not likely to live up to the spirited full-length animated Disney production, but this storybook has a lot of merit. It is one of those books that has always been as significant to me personally as its cinematic counterpart. This book version of the tale would earn one and a half stars from me, if that were possible.
Genre: Traditional LiteratureRecommended Grade Level: Early PrimaryBy the time students reach school, there's a good chance that they will already know this story, which makes it an easy one for them to read because they will be able to use the pictures as clues. I like this version of the story because it isn't overly long and the illustrations are ones that students associate Cinderella with the most.
With a wicked stepmother and two jealous stepsisters who keep her enslaved and in rags, Cinderella stands no chance of attending the royal ball. When her fairy godmother appears and magically transforms her reality into a dream come true, Cinderella enchants the handsome Prince Charming at the ball, but must face the wrath of her enraged stepmother and sisters when the spell wears off at midnight.
A cute little fairy tale that my daughter loves. We read it together at bedtime. The pictures are colorful and informative. If you want to be a princess then this is a book to read. Especially if you have young one's who have a vivid imagination. Although watch out for the evil step sister's, they can be a bit tricky.
