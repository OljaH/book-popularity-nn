Even on a prose-local level, concepts/events/personalities are often referred to multiple times before they're explained, as if the author assumes that the reader has skipped ahead a couple of paragraphs before returning to their current place in the book.
Beyond that, it's also generally written with the assumption that the reader already knows about everything that the author is writing, leaving out essential details for the neophyte.
I guess we can chalk this up to the date of publication, but it would be best for the modern reader to have an idea of what the mythology encompasses before diving into this book.
The first third of the book was talking about the buildup to the Civil War, the second third was strategic battling, and the last third was talking about the end of the war and Reconstruction.
Personally, I like more action and less strategy in a book to keep me interested.
For instance, what got my attention was the Battle of Gettysburg because it was very action-packed.
The political aspects, advisors talking to Lincoln about the 13th Amendment, and Congressional matters were less interesting to me because there was little or no military action.
I never finished this book. It was very basic and not an easy to read style. There was nothing in it that I learned so I just stopped reading which is very rare for me.
