My god these were good. Brillant imagery, amazing control of narrative. I want to read everything bunin wrote.
Love is like a sunstroke: it heats heavily and unexpectedly. There are no happy ends in Bunin stories, because love is always a tragedy. The stronger the feelings, the deeper love hurts. True love can't last for a long time. Otherwise, it becomes a tiresome habit.
aaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaa................sooooooooo boring
A very entertaining story by the Nobel Price winner. Reading this story was like walking in a shallow, sunny beach, barefoot. Ivan Bunin is a very talented writer of the modern Russian literature. Unlike some modern Russian authors, he really has the gift which Gorkys and Chekhovs possessed. Stories like this reminds us again and again, how unique Russian writers are from others.
Beautiful! Bunin's writing is nostalgic, melancholic, sensual, poetic... Even if you read this short tale, you can understand why Bunin won the Nobel Prize.As long as you can find a good, I mean a GOOD, translation.
I have loved Bunin since first discovering him while studying in Russia. Hettlinger's carefully crafted translations best capture Bunin's essence, the play of light and dark that runs throughout his prose. I'm thrilled that these stories can now be enjoyed by a wider audience.
Nice!
one of my favorite stories...
when you had gone, my heart was broken.
Sunstroke - the best love story. Passion, madness, suffering...
