This is a great read. Hopkins practically founded modern advertising. He advocated for measuring everything and testing everything and holding advertisers accountable for results in 1927. Before the internet, before big data, before conversion tracking.David Ogilvy said: "Nobody should be allowed to have anything to do with advertising until he has read this book seven times. It changed the course of my life."It's required reading for anyone that uses words to convince other people to do things.
This is THE BOOK to read if you want to be a successful marketer.
If David Ogilvy (considered the father of Advertising as we know it today) says that you should read it SEVEN TIMES then what are you waiting for?It's amazing to see how advertising hasn't fundamentally changed in more than 100 years.
This will be THE BOOK that I will start recommending when people ask me for marketing book recommendations.
A man who has worked wants to see others work.""I have never known of a line where individual advertisers could profitably change habits." "Salesmanship-in-print, in principle, is just the same as salesmanship-in-person."
Claude Hopkins was the godfather of direct response marketing, and the two books here (now printed as one) changed the game for everyone. This is my go-to gift for new clients, friends or newbie marketers.
One is biographical, the other is simply advertising genius.In he early part of the 20th century, business was in the midst of a revolution in the USA.
Not only were there significant changes in methods of production, but there was a corresponding change in the methods of marketing and advertising.
Claude Hopkins was at the forefront of the sales and marketing revolution, and his Scientific Advertising stands as a monument that is still used today to teach marketing skills to people in business.Marketing guru Jay Abraham claims he read Scientific Advertising 47 times.
If you're in business and looking to ways to increase sales, read this book.
Forty-seven times, at least!
Phần đầu là về các case study của ông, cùng những nhận định; phần 2 là đúc rút ý từ những kinh nghiệm đó, nên có vài chỗ còn trùng lặp.Đọc xong cuốn này mình hiểu hơn rất nhiều về ngành quảng cáo, tự nhiên lại có thể liên hệ thực tế, phân tích được thật là kì diệu.
Trong sách bác có đề cập các cách cụ thể rồi, nhưng một số cách mình thấy không phù hợp với ngày nay nữa.
Claude Hopkins, a copywriter at his finest during the early 1900s, was offered the opportunity to venture on his own.
30 years later, his wife finally convinced him to start something of his own.
"The day before Christmas, in the year I made my inital success in selling carpet sweepers by letters, Mr. M.
You are too good a man to work for me.
He ended by saying: "I am selfish enough to want you to stay here.
If you do, your salary will be much increased next year.
But I am fair enough to advise you not to stay.
It was my great mistake.
Claude C.
Hopkins, one of the greatest advertising pioneers, believed that advertising existed to sell something.
He knew them very well — their needs, desires, behaviors, and wants.
What he learned in advertising and his experiences are all documented in the book: My Life in Advertising and Scientific Advertising.I enjoyed reading it!
The only downside was that there were times when I was tempted to skip some chapters.
If you want to read the book and you feel like a certain chapter is not that essential for you, feel free to skip it.More detailed review at https://anthonycatantan.com/boost-you....
An interesting mixture of biography and lessons, though as Hopkins notes, he doesn't bring anything up unless it has pedagogical value.
My Life in Advertising shares the things he discovered through all of this effort.Might be a bit outdated (Hopkins died in 1932), but at the very least his scientific approach is as relevant as ever.
Scientific Advertising, the second book, is a succinct summary of all of the lessons in the former, so it's worth looking at if one doesn't have the inclination to read his biography.
Omg finally!
This book took me about 20 months to read.
But. 1) it was in paper.
I have much less opportunity to read paper books against ebooks.2) it wasn't fiction - you have to focus and think about what you're reading.3) it was in English - mind you, more than 100 years old English!
Now while I'm not a native speaker, I don't usually have troubles with English texts, but 100 years old...
Omg.4) it's outdated.
While I understand that some great advertising men (even David Ogilvy) appreciate Hopkins very much, I feel many of his claims are simply deprecated.All in all - wasn't worth the time, I am sorry.
I've been reading a lot about Claude Hopkins' life for a little while and I picked up this book to hear from the man himself; one of the founding fathers of modern advertising.
The book talks about his life in the field and key lessons learned, such as: • Advertising and copy are salesmanship in print.
• Facts and figures will always trump opinions and claims.
• Advertise to the individual.• Always advertise with the benefit in mind.
Even aside from these lessons, there are some great insights into Claude's life, his philosophy and his secrets to success.
Do you want to sell anything online?
Then these books might be your secret weapon.
My Life in Advertising and Scientific Advertising are great reads for anyone who wants to persuasive online.
This is the first book someone should read if you want to be a copywriter.
I would rename this book copywriting 101.
It is an easy read and quite interesting.
These books are free online.
The copyrights for this book is open, so several people is giving it away as a pdf.
You can also find these two book on Apple iTunes in audio form.
I'm not in advertising but I enjoyed this book. Tons of practical advice. Keep track of your expenditures, measure how much effect the advertising has. Fancy is not better. Simple is the best. Talk about specifics. Your product is not "The best in the world". Instead, it's "4x better than XYZ because ABC" and so on. Your advertisement is not a place for ego, it's a place to tell your customer how they stand to benefit. Headlines matter. A lot.. Good book!
Lot of eye-opening themes in this book. Crazy to read this and think of how spot on Hopkins was. Advertising now can actually be traced to a T. The bad part, that I am realizing, is that we are now doing away with common sense. Since everything is done via "scientific proof" advertisers now a days (myself included) tend to rely far to heavy on stats, than using a little creativity mixed with the ability to break down the performance of the ad.
Good readPicked up the book because it was recommended on Gary Halberts newsletter. The theme is advertising can be very scientific, which will make/save you a lot of money if you treat it that way. Test your ads on a small scale & know your numbers before scaling your campaign.
Really interesting, especially if viewed as a historical text. It tracks the development of advertising and consumer goods. How advertising led people to buy beans in tins in favour of cooking their own. I’d like to get the author’s take on how things progressed after his era.
An absolutely classic Marketing book. The concepts are still valid and highly relevant today almost a 100 years after Claude Hopkins wrote this bestseller.
The classic of classics. Everything is there. From Direct Response to Branding.The more I re-read this book, almost - or even - everything modern gurus teach, the basis all are here.
Must read! Many of the products that Claude C. Hopkins advertised a century ago are still household products today. These techniques shaped American society.
Iconic read, a must for anyone in advertising and marketing.
My Life in Advertising is a fun read about a prolific advertiser's growth from nothing into an advertising heavyweight. Scientific Advertising is Hopkin's advertising rules he learned throughout his life distilled into a quick guide. More than anything, these two books make a very strong case for measuring all of your advertising efforts. I'd recommend this book to everyone in business. It made me rethink a lot of the ways I currently advertise.
Oarecum intamplator, am dat si peste Claude C.Hopkins, unul dintre parintii publicitatii asa cum o stim noi astazi, iar Viata mea in publicitate.
A tinut foarte mult la chestia asta si astfel, testand tot timpul, a putut sa observe in timp real ce merge si ce nu.Cartea este una 2 in 1, avem o prima parte ce ne vorbeste depre viata lui si o a doua parte ce ne vorbeste despre principiile publicitatii.#Viata mea in publicitateViata lui a fost absolut delicioasa, o putem considera o carte inspirationala si motivationala de la prima la ultima pagina.
It's a pretty good book about general knowledge as well as practical experience in advertising from Hopkins, the father of Scientific Advertising.1.
A good product itself is a perfect seller.
2. The seller'd better give product trials.3.
Sell to the top 20%, who will affect the rest 80% of population.4.
Successful advertisers are like professional sales.
They arent necessarily good in rhetoric, or fluent presentation.
They are authentic, sincere, having good understanding on customers and products.
Other words, advertisers arent necessarily good at grammars or rhetoric arts, but they know how to use persuasive and charming words.
I found this book a fascinating autobiography of Claude Hopkins, a man considered to be a founder of modern advertising, essentially how to persuade others to take an interest and buy the products he advertises.
If you ever have to sell� yourself, or a product this is good background read, advocating the statement of actual facts and figures in advertising.
He had a good understanding of the concept of FREE!
All the more pertinent because the previous book I read (predictably irrational) looked at the scientific research supporting our irrational behaviours when presented with a "something for nothing" offer.
2 stars for My Life in Advertising: Slow, boring, dated but good stuff if you have the time and patience to interpret it - and just an interest in Claud Hopkins as a person, what his motivations and regrets and such were.
His big picture thoughts are don't be so scared to set out on your own if you are already creating a lot of value for employers, greater focus on family and place more than just money, and a love for work is something to cultivate in yourself and others, instead of viewing it as a "gotta do it" so you can do things you actually care about.4 stars for Scientific Advertising: Because it's awesome.
You'll end up ahead if you're generous.So skip My Life in Advertising unless you're a C.Hopkins nerd, IMO.
The big value of the book was a reminder of getting back to basics in marketing, understanding the customer, seeing how they react when you get the product in their hands.
The author advocates for us as marketers to get out there in the field, even though the book was authored over 100 years ago, the lessons ring very true, and if anything they are even more important today as we get further and further from actually seeing how our products impact PEOPLE.
As a digital marketer especially so much of customer sentiment is lost in rankings, click throughs, and open rates.
Even though Mr. Hopkins hails from a different era, his insights and instincts on the psychology of basic tenants of advertising are invaluable. He teaches that to be successful the ad man must align with the common person, dispense with complicated language and think in unison with the eberyman in the street....in other words the vast majority of your potential CUSTOMERS.The book is absolute required reading for every person who is serious in writing of crafting effective advertising!
I have to read this book for school, and I reeealy hate it. Maybe the author is an expert in his field, but he is also very boring, and extremely conceited. It might be a useful book if I was actually interested in advertising, but the author is such an unbearable person that I seriously doubt it.
As a coach and business owner I found this book invaluable. I even read it while on vacation and made copious notes to apply to my coaching practice. Hopkins breaks down why many of his classic campaigns worked. Modern marketers would serve themselves well by going back to the basics, and this is where it starts.
The man pioneered advertising and the foundation to many of the things we do today. However many of the things he believed are out dated. Somethings he was ahead of his time on; don't sound like a company, sound like an individual. Speak to an individual, not the mass. Find something specific that drives action. Use data to drive your advertising.
