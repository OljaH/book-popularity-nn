If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Just for Us Techies: "Shatterday" by Harlan Ellison(Original Review, 1980-12-10)Houghton Mifflin finally delivered a receptacle for the Shatterday limited edition book plate Ellison: the book itself. I definitely approached the book with a pro-Ellison prejudice, but even normalizing for that leaves me in awe of this guy.
This entire series can be listened to multiple times; it’s that good.This collection has a large number of award winners and nominees (he has a lot to choose from).
The good thing about short stories is that it’s not a big time investment to re-listen to the ones you really like.
It’s a very powerful allegory of what US soldiers experienced both in Vietnam and after returning home.“Shattered Like a Glass Goblin” (1968; Nebula nominee): This is a trippy story about a man who comes back from Army basic training to reconnect with his fiancée.
Aiuta a sbarcare il lunario, in modo da non dover scrivere mai più per la televisione (…) E spesso dico qualcosa della condizione umana che mi sembra perfettamente ragionevole e appropriato, perché so che condividiamo gli stessi pensieri.
Tutto questo per cercare l’unica verità che sta al centro di ogni pagina di narrativa mai scritta: siamo tutti nella stessa pelle… ma per il tempo che ci vuole a leggere questi racconti ho solo la bocca.
le cose più spaventose che voi o io possiamo pensare.
Unlike other writers, Harlan's stuff isn't timeless, it's quite dated, somewhat by his need to name drop and do clever bits of product placement, because Harlan is very much a product of his times and he is locked in a perpetual angry young man mode.It's part of his charm, but it also makes me what to slap him.The straight sci-fi holds up the best: 'How's the nightlife...?' is funny and adolsecent twist on alien invasion stories, 'Executioner of malformed children' was interesting with a rough twist at the end, 'Flop Sweat' could creep out Stephen King and 'Jeffy is five' deserves being called a classic.There's the stuff in the middle, that's a great idea that doesn't seem to go anywhere.
What is Harlan Ellison's best short fiction collection? My automatic answer is Deathbird Stories but Shatterday packs a wallop too. Two of his best short fiction works are here, "Jeffty is Five" and the title story yet there is not a filler piece to be found. All are quite impressive. I especially like his sad and reflective "All the Lies That Are my Life". Shatterday may surpass Deathbird Stories in that it encompasses a wider variety of emotions. Best Ellison collection? Call it a tie.
Reading again. Wow, I forgot how much I loved this book.
These stories are good. I have a problem with Ellison's introductions to them, however. Harlan Ellison is smarter than us, a better writer than us, more worthwhile than us, does more than us, is sexier than us...well you get the idea. There is is one thing I wonder about, though. If all this was true, why wasn't he happier than us?
Again, Harlan Ellison's writing has amazed me, enthralled me, horrified me, and shocked me.Almost all the stories in this short story collection are grim-- you can count on unhappy endings for all of them.
A message it sends is that when you find someone you love, even the idle time you spend with them is meaningful and completes you.I really liked the other stories, but just listing them and giving vague descriptions wouldn't tell you anything.
You'd have to experience the stories, read them yourself.The two short stories I abhorred were "All the Lies that are My Life" and "Shoppe Keeper".
He's much more interested in being somebody than in being a writer.
But when he's good, he's among the best, especially as a short story writer.
And this is, in my opinion, his best collection.
The title story is pretty straightforward science/alternative fiction that investigates our many parts.
Along with Lonesome Dove, it best describes what it means when I call someone a friend.
Through our friendship, I have bonded with each of them.Even when I am angry, even when I don't like them, I still love them.The best book by the best science fiction author on the planet.
Too good to pass up.
Chiunque abbia scritto un racconto ispirato a Django Reinhardt merita stima e rispetto - quanto meno per il buon gusto musicale.
Se poi i suoi racconti di fantascienza sono interessanti e inusuali, si riesce a perdonare qualche passo falso, neppure troppo piccolo, a fronte di piccole gemme come il celebre Jeffty ha cinque anni o il crudele L'uomo che pensava solo alla vendetta.
E si perdonano anche le introduzioni autocelebrative che precedono ogni singolo racconto - solitamente mi affascina leggere ciò che un autore ha da dire riguardo alla sua ispirazione o alle circostanze che hanno portato alla creazione di un'opera, ma Ellison è riuscito a creare irritazione invece che aspettativa (ottimo lavoro, Harlan).
This is hands down one of my favorite books.
I try to read it every year or so.
Harlan is at his best when he's dishing out the pathos, and here he puts his characters in some very strange and disturbing settings and situations.
I love the title story in this short story collection, I read it whenever I am at a crossroads and there is something I desperately want to change about my life, or when I'm feeling depressed.
It reminds me that everyone has the power of self-determination, that there is the possibility of change if we are brave, and stare down the selfish person within.
Harlan Ellison refuses to let things work themselves out. In his stories, (especially my favorite in this book "Count the Clock that Tells the Time") slighted people who wait around for justice and karma to right the universe get just as screwed as the characters acting in the wrong. Bottom line: do things for yourself and fight back when people take advantage of you. There is no room for pity in a well crafted Ellison story. I think he was especially pissed when he wrote the stories for Shatterday.
Shatterday is one of Ellison's very best story collections. My favorites, aside from the title story, are Shoppe Keeper, and the undeniably classic Jeffty is Five. Ellison uses the same words that other writers do but puts them together in unique and moving ways.
Dos de los cuentos que forman esta antología son sublimes ("Jeffty is Five" y "Shatterday"), si solamente hubiera leído esos dos, se hubiera llevado cinco estrellas sin problemas, pero ps el resto está medio eeeeeeh. Igual está recomendable, cómo ño.
Out of this worldNeil Gaiman speaks very highly of Harlan Ellison. Having read this book you can clearly see why. Some very good short stories in this collection. Every one of them leaving some lasting mark long after you have read them.Harlan Ellison is something else.
ShatterdayI felt this was a very balanced collection and enjoyed Harlan's introductory anecdotes. He is one of my favorite writers.
Seriously my favourite author, I love the variety of stories in this but the short story titled after the book took the cake for me. Ellison is amazing.
Great stories.... Don't read more than one or two at at time though or you'll have to lock yourself in your room until the darkness passes ::::smile::::
I came to buy this book after reading Neil Gaiman's journal; an article he wrote about his friendship with (the recently departed) Harlan Ellison.
I'm no fan of Gaiman's fiction but I do admire him as a writer, and I don't like the science fiction or fantasy genre, and yet something compelled me to buy Ellison's Shatterday.
I don't think I have come across a writer quite like Ellison, and I have never highlighted as many passages in a book as I have this one.
It isn't a book I would recommend for everyone, it's definitely one for those who appreciate sci-fi, fantasy, and the art of writing.
Harlan Ellison takes his readers on a tour of their own worst imaginings. Irresistible prose, witty, gritty, unsettling and thoroughly entertaining. Recommend!
But I knew Ellison by reputation: he's known as the cranky old man of sci-fi, as a Luddite who has sued a long list of collaborators and producers over the years.
I would LOVE to have been listening to this show when Ellison read this one on the air.Apparently Ellison has been married something like five or six times.
I get the impression that Ellison thinks of himself as a lonely person, and stories like "Count the Clock That Tells the Time" and "The Fourth Year of the War" give us some insights into his mindset.
To say that this collection was better than my first experience with Ellison is an understatement.
This CRUSHED "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" in comparison.
Not only was this book bookended by two of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read ("Jeffty is Five" and "Shatterday"), it also had some gems in the middle.
There was one story about a boy who was born to serve in the army and the parents had to go through the trauma of seeing their son go through hell to do so.
These were the kind of gems that I found all across the collection.
But it's not your everyday, Disney happy ending....and getting there may be a bit more painful than you'd like.
Ellison, as he puts it, walks through our lives and runs them through his spectacular imagination and hands them back full of all the horrors and nightmares and mortal dreads we don't want to face.
It's the idea that these things were called forth by human beings just like you and me.And that's what makes these stories so great.
The stories show us to ourselves....and if we're brave enough we learn from it.I had forgotten what a master storyteller Ellison is.
Originally written in one day as a promotional gimmick for a talk radio appearance, it is still a remarkably good, genuinely suspenseful horror story.Finally, we also see that when Ellison is at the top of his form, his stories are second to none.
It's a creepy and perceptive story about nostalgia and the stranglehold it can put on our psyches."All the Lies That Are My Life" and "Shatterday" deserve mention also, for the insight into the troubles of human condition that Ellison does so well.
He takes the short story form and makes it hum with insight.
I came to this one on the back of Ellison's stellar reputation, and left with my hopes and illusions dispelled.
In a profoundly vulgar, Californian-confessional style, we are told that some people regret moments from their childhoods.
Some people miss their childhoods.
Some people feel they waste their time.
Some people don't like their relatives.
Maybe Ellison was groundbreaking in his time, though I find that hard to believe, when I compare him to Le Guin, Bester, and other contemporaries.
Compared to the writers showcased in The New Voices of Fantasy anthology, which I read immediately before Shatterday, Ellison seems very thin gruel indeed.
There's more to it than just remaining 5 years old, too.The book also contains another 5 star story - "All the Birds Come Home to Roost", about a man who had a horrible experience with his first wife which left him broken and mentally unstable.
After breaking up with his latest girlfriend, he runs into the previous one and spends the night with her.
After a few more, he realizes that he's cycling back through every previous girlfriend which will ultimately lead to ...The introductions to each of the stories are very much worth reading, too.

It was good to renew that old acquaintanceship with this volume and another one called Paingod and Other Delusions.
If you don't want to be disturbed, don't read Ellison.
He's bitter, and a genius, and both of those elements come through in these stories:A selection: Jeffty if Five, about a boy who doesn't age; Shatterday, about a man who calls home one day only to hear himself answer the phone; How's the Night Life on Cissalda, about sex with aliens; and many others.
Ellison isn't afraid to write about anything, and he writes about it quite well.
More than half of the stories in the two Ellison books I read back to back could be published tomorrow and they'd be relevant and meaningful.
That's the greatness of Sci-Fi (a term Ellison hates) and also a weakness; Ellison's a fantastic Doomsayer.3.
A third of his stuff is hamstrung by some brutal sex norms that are common to Sci-Fi. Ellison tells you directly he was a weird, isolated kid.
Someone much smarter than me is currently pissing Ellison off, writing whole college courses on Sci-Fi and Sexuality that feature his less than flattering moments.
This is a collection of short stories by Harlan Ellison.
Mr. Ellison seems to be quite and interesting character!These stories are about mortal dreads.
We don't all share the same dreads, so depending on the story I could connect or I couldn't.
As I think that you need to personally connect with the stories based on your own background I won't go into any details of them.I conclude this review with two quotes from the book which I liked, and which may give you a hint about what this book is like: "There is a reason why the Present begrudges the existence of the Past." and "There is no freedom in oblivion."
