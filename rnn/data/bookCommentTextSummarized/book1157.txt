Their choice of books is a fascinating one - they have the courage to bring to us in the 21st century some books that have been condemned in the 20th century (the present book COCAINE is an example), while uncovering authors of quality to place before the English reading public.A bit about the author: Pitigrilli was the pseudonym for Dino Segre (9 May 1893 - 8 May 1975), an Italian writer who made his living as a journalist and novelist.
His most noted novel was Cocaïne (1921), published under his pseudonym and placed on the "forbidden books" list by the Catholic Church because of his treatment of drug use and sex.

رمان از مصرف مواد سفید کم نگذاشته و از میان اسنیف گرد لذت به سکس، ارجی، تحرکات زیرزمینی، همگی در سوسوی شهوت که مواد نامشروع می‌تواند فراهم کند می‌پردازد.برای خواننده قرن 21 شاید تباهی نشان داده شده در رمان نرم به نظر برسه ولی کوکائین همیشه به سیستم شوک وارد کرده است.

Dort wird er mehr oder weniger zufällig Journalist und verfällt dem Kokain ebenso wie zwei Frauen, zwischen denen er hin- und hergerissen ist: Seine alte Liebe von einst, früher Maddalena, jetzt Maud, 'hatte die ganze Skala einfacher Liebe durchschritten, um sich auf die Suche nach dem Laster zu machen.' Und Kalantan, die bildschöne Armenierin, 'die durch die kompliziertesten Formen des Lasters gegangen, um die Einfachheit von Umarmungen ohne Raffinement zu suchen.' Doch es würde diesem Buch nicht gerecht, reduzierte man es allein auf diese Liebesgeschichte.
Dino Segre wrote a brilliant nihilistic and cynical satire, wonderfully capturing much of the state of post WWI Europe with all it's hypocrisy, bigotry, and deceit.Since every good satire requires extremely sharp wit it is no surprise that Segre's intelligence manifests throughout the book in abundant sharp observations, many of which are sadly as relevant today as they were in the 1920s when Segre wrote this novel.Segre's primary topic is the relationship between men and women but along the novel he exposes his opinions on the mob, mysticism, journalists, religion, medicine, and more.Sometimes his satiric views even foreshadow developments taking place today, giving his views on jealousy an interesting twist when viewed in the context of the intellectuals open-relationship movement of the present day.Things get very sensitive when Serge starts to share his views on Jews (he, himself is born of a Jewish father, whom he loathed)"And will you go to Palestine?" Tito asked."No, I won't," the rabbi replied, "I'm too well off in Warsaw.""But what about the persecutions, the pogroms?""That's all humbug," the rabbi replied with a lough.
This book was a really different read for me.
A man of several mistresses and his story as he juggles them and what they each mean to him.
But the author leaves little personal notes throughout the book to the reader (which I enjoyed) and that is how I resolved the confusion of who or what Cocaine was.
I'm just not sure to whom as it was such a different read, as I said before.
I would love to read another translated book by New Vessel Press as they seem to have several interesting ones in the works.

7/10
Don't fall in love with the world's most enthusiastic prostitute or become a cocaine addict, or at least not both at the same time. That is what I learned.
A lighter Celine? An early (1921) fabrication of news for money and social manipulation. The freedom of that era, Paris in the first decades of the 20th century. The improvised lives. Wonderful. As is the insidious and quite subtle depiction of addiction.
This reads a bit like Isherwood's THE BERLIN STORIES meets THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY though not as good as either. It's an interesting book from an interesting time. Worth the read. Parts are very enjoyable. Ultimately I think it needed to be fleshed out a bit more.Glad I read it.
Großartiges Buch, sehr erstaunlich, dass das schon 1927 geschrieben wurde.
A real page turner. Very modern and funny. Loved it!
The central character, Tito Arnaudi, spends most of the novel shuttling between 2 women, the wealthy Armenian widow Kalantan and the not-very-talented music-hall dancer Maud.
Eventually, he steals money from Kalantan in order to follow Maud to South America, and tries desperately to convince her to stop taking lovers and to be faithful to him.
Although Maud is genuinely fond of him, she doesn't oblige, and in the end Tito decides to commit suicide, but in a way that gives him a sporting chance to survive.
Tito, who studied medicine in his youth, and knows what he has ingested, puts up with one wrong remedy after another with true stoicism, and eventually dies of pneumonia.
Like when Titu sniffed coke for the first time.
He sniffed a double dose and considering that he hadn't done it before, he should have been knocked out but instead he was just fine.
And when he wrote the article about Maud being this great dancer, nobody checked it before it was published, even though they knew Titu wasn't supposed to write again.
I mean, isn't there always supposed to be someone who gathers all the articles, double-checks them and then gives them for printing?
I also didn't like how in the second half of the book, the narrator keeps calling Maud by the name of Kokain.
While Pitigrilli does a fine job exploring and ridiculing the drug culture of the upper classes in 1920s Europe, the characters are so bland that I can't even remember their names.
The narrator's irreverent humor does somewhat redeem the lackluster plot though, with an especially memorable scene where the protagonist, a horrible journalist and wannabe playboy, makes up a sensational story about an execution because he's too lazy to get out of bed.
As a journalist, I can't help but make comparisons between Pitigrilli's and our speculative media.
But all in all, you can definitely pass on Cocaine unless you have a special interest in the outlandish drug culture of the 1920s.
I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.Written in 1920's France, this book was banned due to the sex and drugs it portrays.
A young American arrives in France and needing income decides to use family connections to get a newspaper job.
I wanted to like it more than I did, I'm not sure if it was the translation or the style of writing that made portions of the book drag.
Regardless, I'm very glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in 1920's Paris or 20th century drug use.
The obvious explanation would be that it was the psychological impact of the Great War… which seems plausible.
It’s a fairly dark view of human nature: lustful, jealous, manipulative, untrustworthy, superficial, pleasure-seeking; but it makes for an entertaining read.
All the sex and drugs must have been rather shocking at the time, and the Catholic Church apparently put the book on its banned list, but it’s not actually very explicit.I’m glad I didn’t read the afterword until afterwards, because it turns out that ‘Pitigrilli’ was a pretty unpleasant human being, which doesn’t make the book any better or worse but might have lessened my enjoyment of it.
Con una sniffata della famosa polverina, (1921) una siffatta opera con gli amorazzi di un libertino (coi sensi di colpa sic!) e una ballerina. Utilissimo per spatinare la quasi totalit� dei belli e dannati che ancora sostengono il bisinissi, ricordiamo loro che gi� Baudelaire aveva spesso portato i capelli verdi e che pippavano dei dinamici travet nei caf�-chantant. Nulla come la bianca signora fa credere di essere brillanti, ruffiana chimica, sicofante sintetica e adulatrice organica trasforma il rospo in principe e la zucca in carrozza. Togliamo una lettera, poverina.
The viciousness of the narrator and the protagonist are worth the price of admission. What a romp! A picaresque, highly comical social novel (ugh, what does that even mean?) that refuses to see the good in the world, only the absurd - but minus the heavy, dark, existential part one generally has with that attitude. The ending almost seems to satirise Madame Bovary, which is already satirising the romantic heroine demise. Read!
Ich kannte den Autoren nicht und entdeckte das Buch beim Stöbern in der lokalen Buchhandlung. Zuerst las es sich etwas zäh, bis man sich an den Stil des Autoren gewöhnt hatte, aber dann muss ich sagen- es überraschte mich enorm! Eine wirklich gute Story, wenn auch sehr fies und hart. Auch, wenn das Kokain gar nicht so die sehr tragende Rolle spielte- es ging mehr um den Hauptcharakter Tito und seine Geliebte- aber ohne Spoileralarm- lasst Euch drauf ein! Absoluter Klassiker!
I received this book through the Goodreads First Reads program. I'm astonished this book doesn't have more notoriety in the US. Not until the end of the book, in the 'Afterward', did I realize that it was a translation from the 1921. Though considered pornography at the time throughout Europe, and especially in Italy, it reads as a mix between Gatsby and Fear and Loathing. I will definitely recommend it to friends and it would be a mistake not to re-read Cocaine in the future.
Novel published in the 20s' in Paris, Italy. A modern love story. Cynical at times with a comic touch. Because of description of sex and drugs churches put it on list of forbidden books to read. Writing is excellent and entertaining.
Voor al het jonge volk dat graag wilt experimenteren met het bedwelmend goedje. Intrigerend en anti-gedateerd inkijkje in de wereld van koningin cocaïne.Eeuh...hoe lang blijft die roes hier aanhouden?
I tried my best and got passed the first 100 pages but this story hasn't a story but just a bunch of dribble thrown together...nothing makes sense and its hard to have a story when not one character has a life or plot of their own....total waste of paper and ink
You would think this was written during the 21st century seeing that many of the ideals about women and drugs haven't budged. A fun read.
Underrated decadent and languid tale ...There is a fabulous butterfly scene. Not very well executed, but for scenes, photography, atmosphere the book gets thousands of gold stars.
Ah this is great
Actually has very little to do with the title. I tried to finish it, but I just couldn't. This book is dumb and a waste of time.
A very intriguing novel. Loved the historical fiction aspect and kept my attention the whole time I was reading. Would definitely recommend to my friends. Received as an ARC.
