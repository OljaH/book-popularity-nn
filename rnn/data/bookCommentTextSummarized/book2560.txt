Terhune also takes more opportunities than usual (or appropriate) to wax long and eloquent about his opinion of things like wild animals kept as pets, motor cars and other subjects equally unrelated to Lad himself (or even the story he's telling, at times), standing on a soap box shouting his opinions rather than telling stories for pages of lengthy prose.
But I really did like the last two chapters, and they very nearly saved the book from its three-star status in my mind (I was actually beginning to consider a two-star, which would be a first for Terhune on my shelf).
Well, for better or worse, this was a unique set of stories. The book is made up of several stories all about a grand Collie named Lad. It isn't the type of book you'd want to sit down and read straight through, but it's very enjoyable to pick up and read a story or two. As a whole it felt a little repedetive. People are mean to Lad, then he wins them over. Lad has a new friend and he rescues them. etc. Some were better than others. It made me want to take my pup for a walk.
This book is really hilarious! I just love the writing and the clever sensitive collie Lad. Poor thing he got all skunked up in one story and gets into all kinds of trouble! This author clearly loves dogs.
Another wonderful collection of Albert Payson Terhune's short stories about his dear collie chum, Lad, who's odd, almost human personality, has charmed dog folk for 100 years.
no one's read these, i'm convinced, except my grandmother and me. but if you want to read a book about a heroic collie dog, then this is the ticket.
read as a kid- loved horse books more, but dogs were ok too.
Classic dog story
I absolutely fell in love with these stories, almost as much as I love my own collies! Wonderful book that I am anxious to share with my grandkids.
I have read this book many times in my life. it is one of my favorites
