Spin is a Hugo award winner that wonders what would happen if the earth were forced to remain as it is while the universe around us aged at approximately 100 million years per earth year. as far as scifi concepts go, it is a fairly mind-boggling one. to compound matters further, scientists quickly realize that as the universe ages, the earth's chance for utter destruction increases - when and if the shield around the earth is eventually lifted. and that is what creates the human drama within Sp
Spin is a Hugo award winner that wonders what would happen if the earth were forced to remain as it is while the universe around us aged at approximately 100 million years per earth year.
and so Spin is not just the tale of a fascinating scifi concept, but one about the human drama of What Is The Right Path To Take?
and so Spin is both a novel of grand ideas, staggering possibilities, elaborate ways to wonder why and how and when and what if...
(note - satirical spoiler alerts ahoy)Robert Charles Wilson appears to be paid by the word - how else to account for such passages, and they are legion, as this :The day I left Perihelion the support staff summoned me into one of the now seldom-used boardrooms for a farewell party, where I was given the kind of gifts appropriate to yet another departure from a dwindling workforce : a miniature cactus in a terracotta pot, a coffee mug with my name on it, a pewter tie pin in the shape of a caduceus.Yeah right so the world is about to end and there are millenial cults trashing the place which the woman he loves has married into one of them and his friend the genius has a grim disease and there's this stuff about a man from Mars but let's suspend all that and get the pot, the mug and the tiepin down, don't want to let that stuff go by unrecorded.
Many sci-fi authors lean too heavily on the science and speculation and not enough on the fiction, creating interesting premises but characters that are two dimensional.
Spin starts with the main characters star-gazing as they whitness the night sky and all of it's stars vanish, due to a planet encompasing barrier that slows down time on the earth as eons pass outside.
Tyler, our main POV and the two other main characters live through these events and Wilson does a good job of making you feel as if you were actually there.
There is plenty here for the sci-fi junky as well as fans of character fiction.
Spin was my third exposure to Robert Charles Wilson, a writer who has yet to disappoint me. He is not a "hard" sci-fi writer. Instead, the author writes about regular people and their ways of coping with major changes in their lives and environments. Spin is a very compelling story with believable, yet not overwhelming, scientific details and realistic characters. This is the type of SF novel that I would not hesitate to recommend to readers of high-quality, literary fiction who may want to explore the genre.
This was some of the best science fiction I've read in years.
Heck, it was one of the best books I've read in years.This is the sort of book that I babble about.
It's hard to write down what's good about it because everything about it is good.
It all just comes out in a rush of Plot/Big Ideas/writing style/characters/character relationships/tragedy/humor/everything.
If you've ever enjoyed a sci-fi book, read it.
If you think you might one day enjoy a sci-fi book, read it.
It's one of the best books I've ever read.
It's on my list to read again next year.
Told from the viewpoint of Tyler Dupree, a well developed, high-achiever Everyman, the kind of character most people reading would likely identify with; shades of inadequacy and affection are mixed up in his friendship with Diane and Jason, the twins living in the Big House.
From there, their lives change forever; in subtle fashion for Diane and Tyler, and more directly with Jason, who wholeheartedly pursues the mystery.
We learn about the mystery as Tyler does, and I appreciate the deliberate way it is explored.
I found myself most interested when Tyler and Jason's professional lives intersected, and more of the Spin was explored.

It was SO FUCKING MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING.Putting aside the main character, who has the internal life of a turnip and possibly even less of an external life (seriously all he does is follow Jason and Diane around and listen to their infodumps), the plot is nonexistent.
Here's the premise: when Tyler and his bffs Jason and Diane are children, a membrane encloses the earth.
Jason or Tyler explains the idea that time passes differently inside and outside the membrane surrounding the earth like fifteen times in this book.
(view spoiler)[OMG the aliens had a reason for putting the earth inside a time-controlling membrane!
Following the resounding success of my Locus Quest, I faced a dilemma: which reading list to follow it up with? Variety is the spice of life, so I’ve decided to diversify and pursue six different lists simultaneously. This book falls into my HUGO WINNERS list.This is the reading list that follows the old adage, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". I loved reading the Locus Sci-Fi Award winners so I'm going to crack on with the Hugo winners next (but only the post-1980 winners, I'll follow up with
So from pure premise, we’re at a 5-star start.So next we need our human lens on this story – if it was put to me, I’d have probably suggested multiple protagonists spread around key countries, to give a sense of the varied reactions and consequences to this global predicament, with a matter-of-fact tone, in the style of Robinson’s Mars trilogy.Wilson prefers to keep the lens a little tighter – he focuses on one family, specifically twin boy-girl siblings who are teenagers at the time of the Spin.
What knocked me out about this book was not the science half of the story, which was great, but the depth of the characters Wilson creates, and varied situations that occur and the breadth of the possible responses people have to a literally incomprehensible change in the way the world works.

3.5 rounded up because the ideas were so big & beautiful.
It truly was a work of art, but it felt both too long & too short.
It also never really grabbed me.
The characters seemed real enough, but none of them ever really grabbed me & they should have.
I've been reading SF for 40 years & it wowed me.
Very, very cool & written in a very easy to read style.
At times the debating got a little out of hand, but that was easy enough to skim over.Well worth reading.
Dönüş bitti fakat şu an kitap hakkındaki hislerimi sadece ünlemlerle anlatabiliyorum...Kısaca bayıldım!Kafamı bir toplayayım ayrıntılı yorumu da gelecek!Düzeltme: Yorum geldi... https://yaprakonur.wordpress.com/2017...
Al comienzo de ’Spin’, uno de los personajes está inyectando una droga a otro, y mediante una sucinta descripción, Wilson nos indica que no nos encontramos en la Tierra que conocemos normalmente.
De igual manera, Wilson no olvida la parte científica y tecnológica, y nos va desvelando las investigaciones y descubrimientos debidos al llamado Spin, reflexionando sobre sus implicaciones a todos los niveles, políticos, religiosos y personales.’Spin’ es una muy buena novela de ciencia ficción hard ligera, que mezcla a la perfección la ciencia con las relaciones personales de los protagonistas, todo ello narrado de manera muy fácil por Wilson.
Decir también, que ’Spin’ forma parte de una trilogía, pero que la novela se cierra satisfactoriamente.
Some good examples of such sf books would be The Midwich Cuckoos, Childhood's End, The War of the Worlds, and Way StationSpin is another fine example of this type of science fiction.
I will not go into the why and wherefore of it of course.With that premise you would expect some kind of hard sf where the story is paramount and the individual characters merely facilitate to drive the plot.
I entirely agree with what Jo Walton wrote in her review:"This is the kind of book that makes me feel excited by science fiction all over again.
He and his only friends, the twins Jason and Diane, watched the event which changed their lives forever.The Earth was surrounded by a sort of membrane, called the Spin, outside of which times fly by very differently: “One terrestrial second equals 3.17 years Spin time.” Sun is expanding and without the Spin, the Earth will soon be gone.What follows we get to see through Tyler’s blasé eyes – he’s not however unconcerned, he just accepts the new surrounding reality and adjusts by it.
4.0 stars. The ideas in this book get at least 5 stars and the novel should be read solely for that. The story and the characters are also pretty good and the overall read is very satisfying.

It's always driven me nuts that science fiction and fantasy fans are sort of lumped together.
But what I have read has always seemed so bogged down by techno babble and science mumbo jumbo, it always ends up feeling like work to read it.
Unlike the other science fiction novels that I've read, this one didn't get bogged down with technical descriptions.
I enjoyed reading this book, and when I put it down I always found my mind lingering on it, wondering what was going to happen next, what the full story was.
I think I might be getting a new author crush.
A WTH is going on kind of mystery.
I didn't know going in that this is a trilogy (I think) but even so most questions got answered.
And having read the description for the second book I know what not to expect.This is a perfect example of how I like my science fiction.
I love being confused as long as the author can rein his or her story in by the finale.
And I found this, and a short story I had read before by same author, to be reminiscent of my favorites.
The story of the spin and mankind's reaction to it was fascinating, and the characterization was pretty good, but all the while I could see an unsatisfying ending coming: the author chose to alternate between two time periods and the later one was consistently less appealing to me.The fast-forwarding of the universe was great: a terraformer's dream.
The spin itself was quite grandiose, but it was handled in a practical manner, whereas the rapid influx of concepts at the end seemed vague, magical and rushed.But this was still a very good book.
The human race reacts with denial, hedonism, religiosity, despair, and clever scientific schemes which may offer some hope.Loved the main idea but got tired of the slow pace, language, and characters and eventually skipped through to see how the story would play out.
As a result, some things that should have been more dramatic (like the things involving the actual baddies in the book) just fell really flat.
And I got really tired of the main character's obsession with his childhood crush.
Could easily have been condensed into a much better book or short story.
No apparent change on the planet, but outside the "spin" 100,000 years go by for every earth day that passes.
But, the questions remain, who did this to the earth?
I particularly don't like that we are told in a future time-line chapter, the ultimate outcome of certain events.
Then we must painfully slog through the next series of present day chapters just to see how they got to the end point.
So there is no question of what will happen, but only, how did they end up there?
None of the characters are particularly endearing, in fact I don't really like anyone.

Well I've just added it to my "favourites" shelf, added the 2 sequels to my TBR and given it 5 stars, so that could be some indication of my thoughts.I've read other peoples reviews of this book and it's almost like we were reading different novels, but then I suppose that's why we are all different.Personally it reminded me of AC Clarke books, well written, great characterisation and believable technology.
This is the 2nd RCW book I have read, and like the first, I got to the stage where I had to read on, luckily its Sunday, so I could sit in the garden, in the sun, drinking coffee (or actually forgetting my coffee, yes it was that good a book) and just keep ploughing on.
Bahçeden geçerken gördüğüm gökyüzü; iç karartıcı, son derece siyah, tüy gibi fakat ağır ve gördüğüm bütün göklerden daha karaydı.4,5/5🌟🌟🌟🌟Henüz okuduğum bilim kurgular arasında okumak konusunda bu kadar hevesli olduğum ilk kitaptı.
Bu olaya küçük yaşta şahit oldukları için gelecekte dostlukları devam edecek mi, Diane ve Tyler arasında herhangi bir şey geçecek mi diye çok merak ediyordum.
Daha sonra kitabın yarısına geldiğimizde Tyler'in doktor olduğu zamanları ve Jason'la dostluğunun devam ettiği kısımların yanı sıra araya sıkıştırılan başka bölümlerde bölük pörçük Tyler'in bir hastalığın pençesinde olduğunu okuyoruz.
Kitabın yarısından sonra önce Jason daha sonrasında Diane bir hastalığa tutuluyor.
The story, in it's core, is centered around the lives of three best friends from chilldhood to adulthood as they experience the Spin, a shield covering planet Earth, clearly put there by alien intelligence.
These three people experience and react to the Spin in very different, relatable ways - grandiose ambitions thrive, dysfunctional coping mechanisms manifest, and relationships change in uncontrollable ways for better or worse.
I love how it is the people of the story that moves the premise; the plot doesn't charge ahead, leaving its characters behind.
The plot is the backbone of the story and the characters are the brains and the flesh.
This is the type of book that you wish someone else is reading at the exact same time as you are so that you can immediately discuss all the "did that just happen?" moments.
Truly and absolutely smitten.Edit After 2nd ReadingEven after a second read of this book, and it's still at the top of my list of all time favorites.
But I think it's because the concept really appeals to me as one who loves time travel novels more for imagining the future than reliving the past.
Those who like it seem to enjoy it as a novel exploring a big idea and people's reaction to it.
The best way to come at this novel would be completely blind, not knowing a thing of what it’s about.
For Spin to really work its magic on you the less you know the better.
The good news is, if you read up on the book and know a fair amount before you begin, the intricate story and how it unfolds will still impress you, and engage you to the last page.
Don’t let the science-fiction elements scare you away if that’s not your thing, because while at its core it is a very science driven story, it is not overly burdened with scientific jargon and explanations.
But this is also a book rich in people, from the very personal convolutions of Tyler’s existence in and out of the orbit of twins Jason and Diane, to the deft, evocative way Wilson describes how human societies themselves work.And that’s what’s so brilliant about this book – it’s got range.
‘His heart cried out’ – I think that’s all of us, it’s universal.
Even E.D. When people come to understand how big the universe is and how short a human life is, their hearts cry out.
Bilimsel olarak çok aman aman, çığır açan bir şeyler oluyor gibi görünmese de olan olaylar iyi işlenmiş ve günlük hayata etkilerini doğrudan görebiliyoruz.
Hatta bilinmeyeni açıklama konusunda biraz da olsa bilim vs din "kavgasına" yer verilmiş olması güzel.Bilim yönü tamam ama maalesef dini konularla alakalı çıkarımları beni çok etkilemedi.
Hristiyan mezheplerini ve bir takım kıyamet alametlerini bilen okurlar için bu kısımlar daha etkileyici olabilir belki, bilmiyorum.Genel olarak oldukça başarılı bir kitap.
Yazarın adeta bir anı defteri gibi sade anlattığı metin bu şeklini koruyarak çevrilmiş.Bilimkurguya yeni girecek okurlar için güzel bir seçim olabilir.
Gedikli okurlar için de güzel bir üçleme başlangıç kitabı olmuş, devam kitaplarını bekliyorum şahsen.
They're inextricably linked, and time, both from Tyler's perspective and as a result of the Spin barrier, flows very much like a mobius strip, clockwise and counterclockwise within a Euclidean space.While this is a sci-fi novel, I would hazard a guess that this is probably closer to 40% sci-fi and 60% a character study, with the focus being on the relationship and interrelations among Tyler, Jason and Diane.
What's focused on is a very human drama, dealing with unrequited love, friendships, loneliness, family and everything in between.The main characters (Tyler Dupree, Jason and Diane Lawton) all stood for something: Jason was uncompromisingly a man of science: a child genius, he was created and molded by his father to be the man he eventually became.
