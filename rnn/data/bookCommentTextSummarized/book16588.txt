4 Eve n' Roarke StarsI just fucking love these two.That's all there is to it.
After I finish that book I thought WOW What a fucking amazing story is this!!!
I absolutely loved the 1st book.
After the 1st book they became one of my favorite couples and this amazing series became one of my favorites too and I'm planning to finish this series in 2018!
Please just read this part (I know it's very long but trust me it will worth your time) and let Roarke make you swoon!!!
Simple, basic, ordinary, one that might grow in any garden.
"I wanted both of us to have it, so we could be reminded that some things last."She raised her eyes to his.
Some ordinary things.
“I'm sorry. It's hard for me. I do love you," she said quietly. "Sometimes it scares me because you're the first. And the only"He held her there until he was sure he could speak, then eased her back, looked into her eyes "You've changed my life. Become my life." He touched his lips to hers, let the kiss deepen slowly, silkily. "I need you”  I fucking love Roarke. “She raised her eyes to his. They had both come from misery, she thought, and survived it. They had been drawn together through viole
I do love you," she said quietly.

I fucking love Roarke.
They walked different paths and had found a mutual route.Some things last, she thought.
Like love.” 
“He linked his fingers with hers.
"Is that Gaelic again?""Yes." He brought their joined fingers to his lips.
My love.” 
My love.” 
"are you alright a ghra?" 
"Good thought.
I'm bummed I don't have the time to do a proper review but just know that the love continues. This one was a good as the last. I love Roarke. ❤I love Eve. ❤Another fantastic addition to this series!!
5 starsAnother flawless read by J.D.Robb aka Nora Roberts. The writing is superb, the world is perfection (though I tend to think of it as an alternate reality instead of in the future) and the characters are amazing. Literally kicking myself for not picking this series up sooner.P.S. If Eve and Roarke aren't still together by book 42 I'm so pitching a hissy fit to end all fits!

Not that I feel a need to explain myself; and it’s a bit uncomfortable to complain about this author’s work; but I have my opinion and I always add safety/romance details to all my reviews, I owe it to my dearest friends.I read 4 books and I met 3 ex-lovers of Roarke.
But when the author writes her amazing strong female character with a touch of vulnerability and tortured past, I don’t particularly like, when they rub his flawless beautiful ex-lovers in her/mine face.
Eve is one of the most beautiful women in my eyes.I love my heroines, female character is always my priority and I’m always on her side.
I loved it, I loved it, I loved it!!!I was afraid that the romance of the series would slow down now that Eve and Roarke are permanent, but that was sooooooo not the case!!!! If anything, there was an extra dynamic between them that was almost missing before. I suppose it mirrors real life in a way. Marriage is only the beginning of a crazy ass ride. There are higher highs and lower lows than you even knew existed.  “I'm sorry. It's Hard for me. I do love you," she said quietly. "Sometimes it sc
I loved it, I loved it, I loved it!!!I was afraid that the romance of the series would slow down now that Eve and Roarke are permanent, but that was sooooooo not the case!!!!
I'm more fascinated with the individuals like Eve and Roarke, Mavis, Peabody, Feeney (sp?).
Who would have thought that the wild, crazy, erratic Mavis would be the perfect best friend to the stolid, staid workaholic that is Eve?
Simply put, the magic is not only within the continuing pages of a series that has dozens of books yet to come, but it's getting better and better.
As usual, these books are so exciting! Makes me want to stay away from video games. Lol. The character development is wonderful. We see more of my favorite house in 'book world'. The ball room has a retractable roof. The 'lagoon pool' has jets like a hot tub. Cool!!Reread time...again-April 2018Is there any better team than Eve Dallas and Delia Peabody?
Another set of murders in future-world (not Australia).
This time it is in the form of people committing suicide after using a virtual reality program.
Eve is on the case, so that means she will totally harass and chase down the wrong person for a while and then somehow get lucky and find the right one - usually after they try to kill her and confess their evil plans first.
Still, I like these books.
I've only guessed the killers early in two of the four books I've read so far.
(okay, I apologize for that)New future things mentioned in this book that I want:Air skatesBody-molding chairRoarke.Can someone get on this please?
Good series entry, but again I had the killer pegged partway into book. However, part of the fun of these books is the byplay between the characters. I'm sure I'll get to books 5 and further in 2017.
With each book we delve deeper and deeper into miasma of human nature.
It's night and day compared to the first book, where she was cold and stoic and closed up like a turtle in her shell.
Now she's more of a human being and it's all thanks to Roarke.
The first on rudely interrupting Eve and Roarke on their off-planet honeymoon.
Any other cop would probably shrug and move on to the next case, but not Eve. When her gut tells her something is shifty in here, she pursues it like a dog does a bone, uncovering someone's sick game with a human brain.
It all came back to me as I was reading that this was the book where I originally fell in love with the series.
All the comedy between Peabody and Eve - J.D. Robb is SO good at writing dialogue.
And all the love between Roarke and Eve - she is also SO good at writing romance:) The last few pages where Eve has that awful panic - tissues please!
Oh and Feeney and Galahad and Mira and Mavis and everyone else.So very, very good.
And this is only number 4 in the series - still so much more goodness to come.......
Lieutenant Eve Dallas was off-planet with her new husband Roarke for the last few days of their honeymoon when Eve was called to a suicide as the only cop on the scene.
But it was when they arrived back in New York and Eve was well and truly back in the job that first one, then another suicide hit the alarm bells for Eve. There was nothing to indicate these were anything other than self-termination, but Eve’s cop instincts were jangling…Was it just paranoia on Eve’s part?
Even on honeymoon time Eve couldn't stay away from the crime scene!It's a geeky story this time and the villain reaction when get caught? Rather shocking to be honest.Hm, yup! I slowly reread this series again:)
View on  Under the CoversStarting off with a sexy pic of Roarke again...because I can.  RAPTURE IN DEATH is by far my favourite of the entire series and that’s quite a statement since I loved all the books leading up to this one. There was just something about this book that lured me in from the get-go. In this one, Eve Dallas is happy for a change. This is not to say that she was morbid and depressing in the previous books, but there’s this spark within her that I noticed right away. She’s a w
RAPTURE IN DEATH is by far my favourite of the entire series and that’s quite a statement since I loved all the books leading up to this one.
She’s a woman in love and it’s just so great to read how her relationship with Roarke grows with each passing book.Lieutenant Dallas’s case this time involves a series of deaths that seem to be caused by self-termination.
Eve and Roarke steam things up in this book!
This scene alone is enough reason for you to start this series!Here's a pic of sexy Roarke after this hawt sex scene...
Honestly, I may not love them, but these books are so fucking addictive. This was vastly better than the others, though. I think. I might even review it. Oh, and I know I've been reading smut lately; I'll catch up on the good stuff tomorrow. Because, exams.
Still great but lucked some of the spark of the first 3!Review to come... maybe!
I Love all the characters from the series, no doubt about it.
*And I didn’t like the scene Eve with the VR also.
I know it’s not Roarke’s fault and I felt sorry for both of them.Eve, I admired you.
It was refreshing that Eve was more open about her feeling toward Roarke.
Roarke, you love Eve and I have no doubt about it, but I want his thought about Eve and especially about his past.
The Author did mention that he had a past and I am not judging him until I know more about his character.
Another good one but once again I was able to guess who the killer was earlier on than I expected. I love a good mystery, I don't like to know the killer until atleast close to the end. I hope the next one is more suspenseful.
2.5 StarsLove all the scenes with Roarke and Eve and the deepening of their bond. Though, I do wish Eve would give just a little more affection and acknowledgement to Roarke. Peabody and Feeny are as always a great support team, and Peabody just cracks me up! This is the second time in a row where I guessed the killer very early on and it's a little frustrating to go through the whole book with Eve (view spoiler)[on the wrong trail. I mean, she's supposed to be an excellent detective, right? (hi

(hide spoiler)]I guess it's my expectations with the mystery that made this less of what I was hoping for.
I like to be surprised by the twists and turns of a well-crafted mystery.The narration was excellent!
THIS time I actually had the murderer pegged early on (yeah me)! Even so, I enjoyed exploring with Eve the influence of nature and nurture, the boundaries of individuality, and the expression of freedom of choice.
Another great instalment of the In Death series with Eve & Rourke. Four down, Thirty something more to go :)
This one was a little slow for me to invest in the story, but after the middle it flowed effortlessly.I just love all the characters and the mystery was very well planned out.
And here's where my trigger warning is going to come in.TRIGGER WARNING (view spoiler)[At one point in the book Roarke is manipulated by subliminal messages.
It's not written in the sensual way that the sex scenes between them are written, but it is not vague either.Later in the book, Roarke admits that the reason the subliminal was able to push him there was because he was that person at one time.
With all the "it wasn't rape" discussion in the book, I'm quite sure that JDR doesn't mean that Roarke was a rapist at one point, or little better.
Eve keeps getting questioned about her honeymoon; Mavis is recording a studio album; Roarke is handing away orgasms like nobody’s business and four people with nothing in common are DEAD.The mystery is the most predictable mystery to end all predictable mysteries since that Cold Case episode where the Butler did it.Roarke is the most fictional romantic leading man ever written, and I know you guys love him for that but I just can't get over it.
You've seen my tits before." But she set the communicator down and struggled the bodice into place."And may I say, sir, they're quite lovely.""Sucking up, Peabody?""You bet." * * *"I'm going to see where she went and when.
What I love:- Eve and Peabody's banter (freaking funny)- Eve and Roarke's moments (sweeeet)- Feeney (genuis!)- Mavis (adorable)- I basically love all the characters in this series.
What I didn't so love:- I love and understand Eve's job.
She has to investigate and interrogate suspects.
She follows her gut feeling but sometimes I feel like her method is too much (but don't listen to me, don't know anything about investigating).- The VR thing.
kind of disappointed in that.
I know, it's not real BUT *sigh* I just didn't like it, okay?Overall, I am still loving and enjoying this series.
Love Eve and Roarke but hate that the honeymoon had to be interrupted but the hot lawn scene was a great make-up for the interruption. :) Hated the bad memories that are haunting Eve. I hope she can get herself help and get through this but I know Roarke won't let her go through this alone. He's great for her and for me too. LOL
Good book in the In Death series. I always enjoy seeing more of Roarke and I love when he calls his wife "My Darling Eve". I was a little shocked at what Roarke did in one of the scenes but it wasn't his fault. Very good book!
I guess, all in all, they weren't unnecessary, but they seemed a little bit like filler sections a lot of the time.One thing that I do love about this book is the continuing character development.
Eve continues to grow and she becomes more confident in her love for Roarke, and his love of her, in this book.
I wish Roarke had been able to hurt him more than he actually did...Okay, last thing: I've noticed that cases in the In Death books follow a basic pattern:1.
However, it continues to bother me that Eve only figures out who the killer is in the last 10-20 pages!
