The One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society, Herbert MarcuseThe One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society is a 1964 book, by the a German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse, in which the author offers a wide-ranging critique of both contemporary capitalism and the Communist society of the Soviet Union, documenting the parallel rise of new forms of social repression in both these societies, as well as the decline of revolutionary potential in the West.
انسان تک ساحتی موجودی ست که در فضای آزاد پرورش نیافته، و جامعه ای بازدارنده، و سرکوبگر، به بهانه های: تأمین نیازها، و تدارک بهزیستی برای او، بی رحمانه گرفتارش ساخته است.

This was a very interesting read, I'm particularly interested in this line of critique on modern society and technology, how our technology ends up imprisoning us within closed loop thinking making it difficult to avoid subjugation to the system, both in the mental and physical realms.
Marcuse hits upon the fact that much of the production of the system is based upon destruction, so you know that kind of view forces you to ask the question: is such a system sustainable?
دوستانِ گرانقدر، این کتاب از سه فصل کلی و 10 بخش تشکیل شده است... من این کتاب را برایِ شما عزیزان سفارش نمیکنم.. چراکه ناامیدی درجای جایِ کتاب موج میزند آقای <مارکوز> ناامیدانه اینگونه مینویسد که: تئوری انتقادی جامعه، حاوی مفاهیمی که بتواند حال و آینده را با پلی به هم بپیوندد، نیست... نه آرمانی دربر دارد و نه موفقیتی، بلکه خصوصیتِ منفی خود را همچنان حفظ میکند. بدینترتیب تئوری انتقادی جامعه برآنست که نسبت به آنهایی که بدونِ امید زندگانیِ خود را فدایِ "انکار بزرگ" کرده و میکنند، صادق باقی می
چراکه ناامیدی درجای جایِ کتاب موج میزند ‎آقای <مارکوز> ناامیدانه اینگونه مینویسد که: تئوری انتقادی جامعه، حاوی مفاهیمی که بتواند حال و آینده را با پلی به هم بپیوندد، نیست...
بدینترتیب تئوری انتقادی جامعه برآنست که نسبت به آنهایی که بدونِ امید زندگانیِ خود را فدایِ "انکار بزرگ" کرده و میکنند، صادق باقی میماند‎در جایِ دیگر اینگونه مینویسد که: در جهانِ معاصر واقعیتِ تاریخی انسان از یاد رفته، وحشت از فاشیسم چون اندیشهٔ سوسیالیسم، همراهِ درکِ شرایط نخستینِ دموکراسی و معنایِ راستینِ آزادی به فراموشی سپرده شده است....
Κατ' αρχήν, η λόγια και πολύ συχνά ξύλινη γλώσσα που με απωθούσε και θα ήθελα να κάνω μια παρένθεση για να εξηγήσω κάτι: η λογοτεχνία μπορεί να χρησιμοποιεί ακόμη και υπερβατικά όποια γλώσσα επιθυμεί ο συγγραφέας, οι επιστήμες του ανθρώπου συνήθως ασπάζονται ένα δικό τους λεκτικό, με συγκεκριμένες εκφράσεις και λέξεις όπου επεκτείνεται ακόμη και στα παραδείγματα πολλές φορές ( παρένθεση μέσα στην παρένθεση :p: ειδικά αυτό με τα παραδείγματα είναι και ο λόγος που παραμένει ένα απ' τα καλύτερα βιβλία Φυσικής του Σέργουεη ικανό να προκαλέσει ακόμη κι έναν άσχετο να το διαβάσει ).
This is the odd progression looked at in One-Dimensional Man, and Herbert Marcuse’s investigation leaves the reader with an altered perspective, enlightened and disturbed at the same time.The book tackles in two parts the Orwellian quality of advanced technology, one part looking at the kind of society technology brings forth, and the other explaining the kind of thinking this society engenders.
Modern society has gutted Enlightenment ideas, such as the right to dissent, and hollowed out concepts such as “democracy,” leaving the terms intact while eviscerating the meanings.
The author goes into some depth about “universal” concepts, concepts of quality which, in one-dimensional society, are stripped of their actual importance.
He criticizes the disappearance of 'multidimensionality' in such societies, claiming that the economic 'goods' afforded by advanced capitalism (as in, eg, the economic boom of the 1950s and 60s, or the present day) has led the ordinary person to valorize the current mode of society, thus leading to the collapse of oppositional social elements and the resulting 'one-dimensional' man and society.Marcuse takes issue with a great deal of linguistical reality in advanced industrial society--he warns that prevailing conceptions of x and y in this society are shaped largely by dominant interests, and the result, he finds, is a betrayal of aspirations for human liberation.
Una confortevole, levigata, ragionevole, democratica non libertà prevale nella civiltà industriale avanzata, segno di progresso tecnico..E’ l’ennesimo libro che si intreccia fittamente alla mia seconda vita e non può essere altrimenti: la prima cominciò ad agonizzare tra il ’63 e la primavera del ‘68.
Nel mio mondo non solo non c’erano tute blu (per alcuni una fortuna: la mancata industrializzazione ci aveva preservati dalla distruzione del territorio, come se la mancanza di reti fognarie non avesse trasformato le magnifiche coste in infinite praterie per i colibacilli) ma i colletti bianchi ci tenevano a esibire i loro simboli di casta.
Marcuse was a very prominent figure when I was in high school and on into the seventies.
His arguments about the revolutionary potentials of fringe groups, such as we students, but also what Marx called the lumpen proletariat, while attractive, seemed also to be wishful thinking--wishful thinking I shared, mind you.During high school and college, Marcuse was often discussed, often along with others from the Frankfurt school, but, as I said, few really knew his thinking well in my circles.
Playboy Magazine offered him a pretty penny to do one of their interviews.
هربرت مارکوزه....چه شب و روزایی که با جامعه شناسی سر نمیشه....مارکوزه پوزوتیویسم رو نقد میکنه و اونو یه عارضه ی فلسفی میدونه.تو این کتاب میگه که فراخ زیستی نظام سرمایه داری یه جور کودن سازی مردمه....کتاب فوق العاده ایه
A brilliant thought provoking and challenging book.
Covers lots of different topics but the key one which i found relevant was the one on technology and how this has been imbibed into our minds and modus operandi.
Ask yourself, if you were to start a new business for example, what would be your first thought when it came to operationalising it?
Technology has become such a leading driver and medium for our thoughts that its hard for us to think independently of it.
Mark Hughes wrote the book in the 50s (i think) and some of the points are massively relevant to the twitter and Facebook generation of today.
yadayadayadayadayadayadayada--- As well read the endless debates of the Scholastic Philosophers for all the good Marxist and neo-Marxist theorizing does anyone. Once buy into the notion of Historical Inevitability, whether it be the Inevitable Class Struggle or the Second Coming of Jesus, and human experience is open to endless criticism concerning its conformity--or the lack of it--or the antithesis of it-- to the way things are spozed to go. Instead, gimme Rachel Ray, the Tuscan Sun and bottle of Vin Ordinaire, ne Marx, ne Jesus. Amen.
به گفته مارکوزه یکی از عوامل اصلی پیدایش انسان تک ساحتی، وسایل ارتباط جمعی و صنایع سرگرم کننده و وقتپرکن هستن که سبب از بین رفتن خلاقیت و اندیشهی فردی میشن. مارکوزه میگه: آگهیهای تبلیغاتی مانع تکامل حقیقی معنای واژهها میشود و واژههایی مانند رشد، خوشبختی، رفاه، توسعه، برابری، دموکراسی و آزادی، با واقعیت همخوانی ندارند.

In a one-dimensional society the only genuine individual is the rebel (the one who refuses the pressure of the society and rejects to become a one-dimensional man).Marcuse thinks that in order to preserve your genuine character in such a repressive society, you will have to practice a strategy he calls ‘The Great Refusal’.

مباحث مرتبط با معنا و رسالت هنر در دوران پیشامدرن و مقایسه اش با دوران مدرن بسیار تامل برانگیز بود. بحثهایی از تفاوتهای ذاتی بین نگاه بالزاک و مثلا تنسی ویلیامز و آنچه دنیای سرمایه داری در مواجهه با معنا بر سر ما آورده است. این بخش آن قدر تاثیرگذار بود که بعد از سالها هنوز به خاطرم مانده باشد
few books have left me more curious to read other people's reviews.
Marcuse devotes the bulk of this book to a deep, often insightful analysis of early analytic philosophy and operationalism in the mathematical sciences.
reading this in 2013, the whole thing is tremendously dated, but absolutely fascinating as a piece of intellectual history.
it is absolutely worth reading if you are into that sort of thing.
if you have not subjected yourself to the classics of the analytic school, particularly 20th century philosophy of science and language, much of this book will be lost on you and you'll be left clutching to the easy rhetoric that bookends it.
One Dimensional Man is Marcuse's best known work, though probably not his best.
The problem with Marcuse (as with other Marxists, I suppose) is that while criticizing industrialization, he still holds out much hope in technology as a potential tool of liberation (as opposed to a means of oppression and alienation underneath the capitalist regime).
Though I should say that One Dimensional Man is much more pessimistic than some of his other works.
I think we've come very far since Marcuse and are much more likely to view industrialization as a system in and of itself that should be looked upon with suspicion--even when not tied to the Capitalist regime.
The 1930s gave us a revolutionary crisis, Jarrow marches and the New Deal in the US.
The current crisis finds the working class meek as kittens and still integrated into their own enslavement through the consumerist spectacle.
Seems Marcuse had a point about his society without opposition.Of course, in absolute terms, Marcuse was wrong because as Mattick said (Critique of Marcuse, Merlin Press, 1977) capitalism can't be planned, the working class can't be written off completely, today's students certainly aint revolutionaries and there are limits to total integration, But there's enough truth in Marcuse's words to make his dismissal by Trotskyist groups who once commanded tens of thousands in their ranks and are now insignificant a trifle premature.
يتحدث الكتاب عما يسميه الاستبداد الكلي في المجتمعات الغربية الصناعية، وتذويب جميع مظاهر الاختلاف الطبيعية واحتواءها في سبيل المزيد من الانتاج وخلق النموذج الواحد ، في الأفكار والرؤى والأحلام والسلوك. وتأثيرات النظام الرأس مالي والسياسة وتأثيرها في التقنية والعكس أيضا، والكتاب محمل بأفكار ما قبل سقوط الشيوعية فهو ما يفتأ يقارن بين النظام الشيوعي والنظام الرأسمالي والحلول التي اتخذها هذا النظام وذاك، لذا ثمة أفكار كثيرة تجاوزها الزمن ، لكن هناك فصل عن اللغة في العالم الصناعي عميق ومركز تحدث فيه عن الأدب وكيف تم تغييره تماما، وعن مفرادت اللغة وكيف يتم جعلها لغة وظيفية بحتة، وعن الثقافة والواقع.
Mass production and mass distribution claim the entire individual, and industrial psychology has long since ceased to be confined to the factory….There is only one dimension, and it is everywhere and in all forms.” Later, Marcuse discusses the Happy Consciousness “the belief that the real is rational and that the system delivers the goods” which then “reflects the new conformism which is a facet of technological rationality translated into social behavior.” Production, for Marcuse, is no longer a means to serve real needs.
"This society turns everything it touches into a potential source of progress and of exploitation, of drudgery and satisfaction, of freedom and of oppression."Wow. Few things I've read in the past 12 months even approximate what reading this fine book was like.
There is still a bread-and-circus show going on, and is still considered a rational thing which only 'fools', 'leftists', and 'hippies' would possibly criticize or refuse.
Herbert Marcuse is a well-read intellectual who set out to write a theoretical philosophical volume, about the nature of understanding and thought and society, but with a very specific aim, to justify the overthrow of Western society..One-Dimensional Man suffers in that it's most radical propositions are laid out as givens and first premises, Which are not analyzed or questioned anywhere in the work.
He refuses to present any reason to believe that he knows what the true interests of these hapless victims of commercial society better than they know themselves..Despite the intellectual weakness of the arguments, I found the book interesting.

Post-industrial technological society is so rational only an irrational person would find anything significant worth altering.
Instead, it appropriates a technic ideology lacking an ethical or moral project.
A return to a philosophy of universals focused on the “negation” of that-which-is allows us to imagine historically plausible alternatives to and flaws in Western Civ. Essentially, this is “multi-dimensional thought,” as opposed to the titular variety.
do their work after him.) Seems to me that today both sides of the ideological split are in a sense breaking free of one-dimensionality.
Responses and beliefs which appear *irrational* in the extreme to the other side of the debate.
💅a i pozdrav za druga petra sa master studija filozofije koji je nevaspitan i na sred ulice dobacuje da je markuze sranje.
možemo da se kritikujemo ako imamo argumente a takvi površini stavovi nemaju vrednost (reče ja koja je kraljica opštemestašenja ovde na goodreadsu 😂) jao ovaj čovek!
baš baš teško za čitanje :( mada sam malo bila u fazonu hehe ajde da vidim i tog oca new left - a, i uglavnom ne čitam neomarksiste (jer se ne slažemo, npr gramši bljak) ovde malo izlazim iz tog okvira i kažem, pa, uglavnom je tako!širu ocenu ću dati posle petka.
posle ispita :D kad položim :D ako položim :D
of course the book is useful because it asks us how do we, as First World revolutionaries, make revolution in the midst of material abundance, and the overwhelming "satisfaction" of the majority of our peers, who can sit on the couch and watch TV, or go to the mall, thinking this is the basis of freedom.
regardless, the ultimate limitation of the book in my view is that politically it holds up Marx's positive view of capitalism in terms of industrialization and the "material basis for freedom," which, looking back with the hindsight of the last 50 years of ecological devastation, is hard to justify.John Holloway's "Change the World Without Taking Power" gains all the insights of One Dimensional Man, without any of the limitations.
