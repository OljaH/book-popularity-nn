This is series of Churchill's articles concerning his observations while traveling as journalist, soldier in WW1 it runs 2:32:47 He was a journalist of great renown before he was Prime Minister, Way before. His wit and perceptive eye for nuance and details are apparent in this book of articles, put to words thru Librivox.orgQuite interesting.
Its jingoism makes it dated, and simple seems part of much of the nationalism and flag-waving that led so many people to charge blindly into the bloodshed of WWI. Its largely a celebration of the British from the perspective of an American, talking about the vile Germans and the affront the present to civilization everywhere.
This is not the British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Spencer Churchill. This is the American novelist, Winston Churchill.
Dated, but very much in the same line that Ernie Pyle would later take during the Second World War.
Nice book to read.
The author is the American Winston Churchill, not the famous Winston Churchill from England. His travelogue is interesting, but not compelling.
I will not be the only one to have started this under the impression the author was his more famous namesake and then been puzzled by the repeated references to his American nationality.
Having got over that, the book can be read on its own merits.
Churchill's accounts of happy and healthy soldiers in the trenches of WWI are not only an insult to the mem and women who endured such appalling conditions there, but if they succeeded in their aim of recruiting American volunteers to add to the carnage, verging on criminal.
