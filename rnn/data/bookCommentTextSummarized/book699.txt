I've never been a fan of Peter Pan but I did see a wonderful ghost story play by J.M. Barrie a couple years ago and so when I found a lovely old 1918 edition of this book I decided to get it.The book listed Four plays, but they were more prose than plays and definitely appeared to be meant to read rather than performed.
Three stories were brilliant, and one I forgot very quickly.The first was about an old woman who pretended to have a son in the War. Though she based it on a real man, and when he came to London for his leave ended up meeting her.
The last one was a wonderful, beautiful ghost story about a father loosing his son in the war.
"We have a fine for speaking about the war. And you know, those fellows we were fighting ... I forget who they were?"
This book is a collection of four short stories involving families affected by world war one.
(a la twilight zone or twelve angry men)The first one was about an elderly woman with no family who spontaneously "adopts" a man who is about to go to war.The second is about the relationship between a father and his son who is inlisting as an officer.
(^^These last two would definately make great twilight zone material)An interesting theme in these stories is the relationships between fathers and sons.
I admit, I actually only read the first play in this volume. I beleive there are three or four total. It was witty and rather delightful. Hopefully I'll get around to reading the others some day.
Wonderfully moving simple book of four stories involving ordinary families during The Great War, published in 1918. Written by the author of the famous Peter Pan.
