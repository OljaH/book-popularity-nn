She was a prolific writer and this was one of her first novels, written in 1919...it was an interesting read just for the language and social mores that were prevalent at the time...one of the more interesting story lines was about an unplanned pregnancy, but the word "pregnant" was never used and the reader still knew exactly what was being discussed!
Another term was "make love to", in this case though, it referred to courting, not the deed...many of the characters experienced cathartic moments and the detail of their thoughts and emotions made the story move along quickly.
An old fashioned story told with charm. I am fond of novels written with some innocence, yet tells about struggles of morality and hard situations without going into details that are harsh and violent. Reading this book is like watching a 1940's movie. I love old movies and old books of this type. It is difficult sometimes to read about the roles of men and women that were in a less enlightened (ha) age.
I discovered the wonderful author Frances Parkinson Keyes in 1981 when I visited her former home, The Beauregard-Keyes House, in New Orleans.
Mary took her in as a lodger and the family quickly learned that Sylvia was very wealthy and eager to help them out by paying for improvements to the house, things to modernise the farm, education for the younger children and much more.Austin Gray, one of the older children does not appear to take to Sylvia initially and resents her arrival and gifts.
I think this one one of the most beautiful books I've ever read, such an amazing classic, shows what a Godly relationship is really suppose to be like, between friends & lovers.
The delights and anguishes of love sweetly captured, it perfectly blends the highs and lows that Life never fails to test us with... a timeless story of perseverance and optimism written.
