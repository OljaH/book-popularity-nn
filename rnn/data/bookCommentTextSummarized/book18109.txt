5 stars!!!   “Love is what you would do for the other person, not what you do in general.”   When I read T.M. Frazier’s first book, The Dark Light of Day, in 2013 and I was hooked. I love this author’s writing style, the way she can write so much beauty among all the ugly content she writes and the feelings her books evoke. I feel like I have been waiting for the longest time for her second full length novel, King- but let me tell you guys something… KING was worth the wait! Our story starts wit
I love this author’s writing style, the way she can write so much beauty among all the ugly content she writes and the feelings her books evoke.
I feel like I have been waiting for the longest time for her second full length novel, King- but let me tell you guys something… KING was worth the wait!
Our story starts with a young Doe. A girl with no memories.
When King first sees Doe, he doesn’t know what to think.
I love getting those twists thrown into books that I didn’t see coming.
If you love twists and turns in your stories, read this book.
Hello All! I am so sorry that the delay has upset anyone. This project was my number one priority but when I found out I was pregnant I also had a 9 month case of writers block which didn't allow me to finish it when I wanted to although I had every intention of doing so. Add to that the change in publishing direction, issues with editing, changing it into a 2 book series, and having my baby, and here we are a year later and still no King. It WILL be out before summer, I'm shooting for Apri

I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this book but sadly this story needed a lot of further work. So many portions of this story seemed rushed, overlooked, underdeveloped and thrown in for shock and awe purposes. The hero was a big letdown for me but I really did like the heroine, Bear and Preppy of course! I struggled with King in so many scenes. One scene infuriated me because his reaction to Doe from the beginning was total caveman. ”You’re not my prisoner. You’re mine.” He then proc
He then proceeds to spend a fabulous dreamy day with the heroine and pulls a....King is quickly falling for Doe the girl who has no memory of her life since a forgotten accident.
All the while King knows her true identity and contemplates his play for that one thing he wants most in the world.Overall, this story missed the mark for me with most scenes happening so quickly and not explored or elaborated on further.
Shocking scenes thrown in for the purpose of shock (view spoiler)[heroine raped and stabbed - all well next day as for the death of best character of the book...
4.5 Stars  I've found myself again in the haunted eyes of a girl who was just as lost as I was.Or maybe, we didn't find each other at all.Maybe, we just decided to be lost together.
I've been a huge fan on this author ever since I read The Dark Light of Day. So when I saw that she was coming out with this book and I read that synopsis?
Suffice it to say I was willing to part with an ovary to finally get my hands on this beauty.
Waiting the extra time since the original release date has been abs
Now recently out of a stint in maximum security prison, King wants to drown himself in pussy and alcohol when she stumbles right into his path.
But when the biker she sets her eyes on sends her to his friend instead, she stumbles right into King's path.
Pup, do you want to know how it is that I know you weren't dreaming about me when you were not he verge of coming in your sleep?""Yes," I whispered."Cause, baby, if it were me you were dreaming about, you'd been screaming a fuck of a lot louder than that," King growled.
5 Desperate people. Desperate things. stars  "Stop being alive, and start living.”  Holy Fucking Hell ...seriously I have no clue how I am going to explain myself when I can't even begin to tell you (without spoiling of course) what this book did to me or how it made me feel! Because I have to tell you, I felt every damn thing. I'm going to keep this short, because honestly the only thing you need to know going in, is KING is the ultimate bad guy with the biggest heart for those he loves. Imagin
I'm going to keep this short, because honestly the only thing you need to know going in, is KING is the ultimate bad guy with the biggest heart for those he loves.
This story is told from both King's and Doe's point of view, which I absolutely loved because I lived each moment with them.
It is with that new found hope that I will be able to survive until their story continues on, because now the possibilities are endless and the reward will be so much sweeter especially when King kick's some ass along the way.
*****FIVE STARS*****{BR with Mel, Sharon, Tiff, Jen, and Tera} King filled me so completely. Not just my body. My heart. My soul. My life. I didn't give a shit if I ever got my memory back. Because with King, I knew exactly who I was. Brantley King is an ex con just released from prison after serving a three year sentence. He has led a shitty life since childhood. When he was twelve, he saved a kid who was being beaten in the playground by the school bully and the two form a fast friendship that
He's definitely an odd character that marches to the beat of his own drum but you'll see that it's quite impossible not to fall in love with the guy.On King's first night home from prison, Preppy and his other friend, Bear, throw him a welcome home party.
She likes to turn shit upside down and throw things at you that you never saw coming.
And that's why I love this author and couldn't see rating this anything less than FIVE STARS!!!!!It ends on an incredible cliffy, but the next book comes out in August.
3.5 StarsI'm way late to the party in reading this. And, being that's it's been out forever - and reviewed to exquisite death - I know there is nothing worthwhile I could possibly add.On to the next.
5***Heart Broken “PUP” Stars     “My fucking heart is broken,”…”Will you remember something for me?” “Remember that I love you.” King      “Brantley King" was 12 years old when he met his best friend “Samuel Clearwater” aka “Preppy” who was only 11 yrs old himself. They both wanted out of their miserable family they were given. King’s mom was a drug junkie and he basically had to care for himself until he decided to run away from it. Preppy’s step father was an absolute ass hole who abused Prepp
He meets Doe first at the party and wants her for himself but he wanted to give his best friend a welcome back gift and sends her over to KING.
This changed the story entirely, Doe and King didn’t realized that there was going to be a magnetic chemistry between the two that will pull them together and change their lives forever.
King takes Doe in after finding out who she was and he wanted to keep her for his own benefit.
I don’t want to grow old and look back and realize that I may have had a life, but I forgot to live it.” King
I wanted her, body and soul.” King
The story of King and Doe is different, unique, captivating, heartbreaking, funny and passionate.
King has never had a relationship before and isn’t sure he wants to pursue one with Doe. Their feelings grow stronger and soon these two will be on fire!!
Apart from being intimidating, he was also possessive, protective, strong, wild and super hot!!I loved the changes we see in Doe gradually throughout this story.
This book left me wanting more and the ending was shocking!!I can't wait for you guys to finally meet King and Doe!!Be prepared for a wild ride that will keep you captivated from the beginning till the very end!!
Seeing everyone's excitement for the new book that just came out about Preppy gave me the push I needed to finally pick this one up.King is the first book I have ever read by T.M. Frazier.
In the end, despite all his imperfections, I couldn't help but want the best for him.I can't conclude this review without talking a little more about my favorite character, Preppy.
What can I say about this amazing story. It's raw and gritty and angsty and angry and tumultuous and I Loved It . The rugged and scarred Brantley King with his best buddy Samuel 'Preppy' are the main characters , they meet 'Pup' and ......ughhh I don't wanna give away the story. It's a beautifully told story, t.m. makes us feel the hunger, pain, love, friendship, kinship, betrayal ,passion , all first hand . Write the next book faster TM , I'm dying here !
I was hoping after taking sometime to cool down, and reflect on the story, I would feel differently.
I tried.
Honest.
I really did.But, I failed.
I'm still upset :/ So I guess I'll be in the minority, because I just did not love this book.
Maybe my expectations were too high.
(view spoiler)[To the character that made the story,  (hide spoiler)] I struggled with King, honestly, he was a walking contradiction, he gave me whiplash and a headache.
The storyline had potential, but occasionally felt choppy and OTT.
In the end I just felt disappointed.
But maybe I'm bitter.

Seriously Folks, if there is one book that should be on your 2015 TBR, it’s KING by T.M.Frazier.
Thanks for the prologue of Tyrant but I need that fucking book more than my next breath!!!Style of writing : Just what I needed.
Not all girls are well-endowed, some of us have mosquito bites!Favourite Part : From Preppy’s letter ‘Open Me Mofos’ till the end I read through blurred eyes and my shattered heart on the floor.
Simply because there were many scenes which were predictable for me; however I am keeping those 5 stars for the second book.Similar books?
If you read one book this year, make it this one!!! Just finished this today and am still reeling in my thoughts about this one. Fantastic, just doesn't do it justice! So many emotions felt while reading this book! Perfectly written, flowed without any back tracking and to top it off, a story line that was deserving of a 5 star rating!!! Because Pancakes!!!

Mark your calenders everyone. June 15 is the day to live by because embrace yourselves for the awesomeness that is King.

On the same night of his party where he caught the gaze of a pair of blue eyes observing him in a middle of one of his inking sessions, something powerful stirs within the darkness in him.Doe is a nobody, a girl who can't remember her name or her past memories.
I loved every single bit of the book- from the moment I picked it up till I put it down in an entire sitting, I was wailing in agony when it ended all too soon.
******6+++++ Monumental Stars******(ARC kindly provided by author)I keep typing and erasing words because is hard to describe the magnitude of my feelings for King. Everyday we waited for this highly anticipated novel was worth it, T.M Frazier's penmanship has deliver a smashing story that will rip your heart right out of your chest and play with every single one of your emotions. Be ready to cry, lust, love and hate King. This novel is definitely a top best of 2015 read.  King is a criminal, a
He's feeling out of sorts and then he sees a pair of blue eyes so powerful that in an instant they ignite all the light and all the darkness that's inside of him.Doe can't remember anything about her past, she's been living on the streets for the past two months but has no recollection of how she got there.
King and Doe battle with the intensity of the hate and lust that is brewing between them.
King made me love him and hate him at the same time and Doe was simply the best.
EVERYTHING.If authors need 18 months to give us such books..
PLEASE TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU'LL NEED and give us more crazy good books like these :D~KingHe may have been the devil, but his body was sculpted like a god.Preppy“Go ahead and say it.
what a bomb the drop was!!The book started with me yelling at the screen, because Doe was behaving stupid and I wanted to slap Nikki!Then it got so hot and cold, so fast it felt like a crazy whiplash!Then...
*phew* boy did the book get super intense!!I didn’t dream about him; he was right about that.
Re-read note: I savored it the second time around.
I think I saw King with a clearer perspective.
Now other thoughts: King is the bad boy asshole women flock to.
Little miss Doe is no exception.
Even if it takes her a little longer to realize it.
She's in a very difficult situation and by being in the wrong place, wrong time, things went from bad to FUBAR.
This story touches on some pretty difficult subjects and I don't think it molds itself to what is conventionally considered right but what is right for who the characters are at the time.
I felt the promise of dark places that would stretch my comfort levels and emotions, some moments certainly did this but I really think the story could have pushed me further and taken more risks which would undoubtedly have raised my angst levels and garnered more emotion.
Most of the time I don't know if you want to kill me or fuck me!" I screamed, every single word he spoke ignited my anger until it wasn’t something I could even begin to hold back.King had the audacity to actually smile.

Maybe both, but one thing was for sure. One way or another, I was going to make her scream. I was finally starting to feel like my old self again.    King isn’t your typical hero. He isn’t a knight in shining armor, a billionaire, or even a nice guy, but boy do I love this guy! King’s life was ne
LIVE on AMAZON -> http://amzn.to/1JPyAFHBrantley King has just been released from prison and is at his welcome home party when he first meets Doe.
King isn’t easy to love at first, but the more you see of him and see what motivates him, he is hard not to love.
Doe is lost, barely holding on and completely hopeless.
Circumstances outside of her control, have put her on the wrong side of King - a place you don’t want to be.
Doe has no choice, but to stay with King, he is the key to her survival.
First, I loved seeing Doe and King struggle with their feelings.
5 **EPIC** STARS  “Oh, pup.
How much fun this is going to be.”  How on earth do I even start writing this review?
My feelings are so all over the place I don't know how to put them in order.
I went through such a whirlwind of emotions - I cried, I was happy, I was frustrated, I was confused, I was scared, I was mad beyond measure and in the end I'm freaking frustrated and suspicious about what comes next.
Something smells funny and I want to get to the bottom of it right now, but as it turns out
Something smells funny and I want to get to the bottom of it right now, but as it turns out we have to wait until August for the next book.Oh well, enough time to tell you about King.
He chose that kind of life a long time ago and never had plans to change his way of living.
The first person I fell in love with was Samuel 'Preppy' Clearwater, King's geeky best friend with a little dark side.
“I didn't know whether I wanted to kill her or fuck her.Maybe both, but one thing was for sure.One way or another, I was going to make her scream.”
3.5 STARS I've been seriously hankering for this book for soooo long and perhaps my expectations were too high… I know I'm in the minority here. King is definitely an anti-hero, he’s hateful, vengeful, dangerous and volatile. I'll admit, I usually fall instantly for an alpha asshole jerk but for some reason, this didn't happen with King and I really wanted it to.  Doe, a homeless and starving young woman with amnesia, is in a living hell and stumbles into King's life. King claims her as his as p
I've been seriously hankering for this book for soooo long and perhaps my expectations were too high…
King and Doe's physical relationship was also volatile - “I’d never both hated and wanted something so much in my entire life.”
While I wanted to like this more, it was still a quick and entertaining read and there were some characters that stole the story, if you ask me.
For instance, there is one horrific incident with Doe and it just felt like drama for drama's sake.
ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review. Holy Shit... KING by T.M. Frazier was a F*CKING BRILLIANT EPIC READ!!!! Pardon my language, but this book was just everything I expected and so much more. It was raw, dark, sensual, captivating, gritty, and an emotional journey that had all the FEELS. This book will grip you to the core and leave you begging for more of KING and his intense personality!! T.M. Frazier's writing was intoxicating, spellbinding, and hypnotic that you couldn't
It was raw, dark, sensual, captivating, gritty, and an emotional journey that had all the FEELS.
I must be a glutton for punishment because I LOVED EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of this emotional, dark, gritty, cruel and raw read.
Ms. Frazier did a phenomenal job interweaving so many raw elements but at the same time gave us a story with so much depth, honesty, grit, and palpable emotions.
So if you are looking for a book where you are taken down a dark, raw journey that has possibility of a luminous and hopeful ending then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to read KING.
They call me DoeAs in Jane Doe  Doe is living on the streets,not knowing her name or anything about her background due to memory loss.She is befriended by a girl called Nikki who tells her the best she can hope for is to get close to a Biker who can shelter her and protect her.She knows what this means but sees no other option than agreeing to go to a party at King's house....KINGDOEKing has just been released from prison and his friend Preppy is throwing him a welcome home party.While at the
So I did something.Something that made the decision to go after her an easy one.A decision that would forever change the lives of everyone around me.Some for the good.Some for the bad.Some for the dead.I found out who Doe really was.
He has always wanted King and Preppy to join him and his MC brothers but is content with working closely with them in mutually beneficial business deals and he always has their back.I loved the mystery behind both Doe and King, Doe is struggling to move forward with her life knowing that she has left one behind that she can't remember and King is also hiding the initial reason that he decided he wanted to keep Doe, he needs her for something, and that something happens to be very important to him.This book had me turning the pages, it was suspenseful and you absolutely did not see the twists coming.
Anyway, this was such a fucked up story that makes you question why you like this character so much.
King was angry, and mean, and he scared Doe at times, so it makes you think you are a little insane to like such a man.
I don't actually know how to describe how this story effected my emotions.
Preppy and King balanced each other and they were fucked up in their own way, and because of that they always had each others back.It kills me to say this, but I actually didn't like Doe that much.
Women, alcohol, and even his love for tattooing can’t seem to fill the void that is eating away at his soul.Doe"I don’t know how old I am.
I was finally starting to feel like my old self again.-King"What is remarkable about this read is the transformation that Doe makes as a heroine and the way that King aids her in making that change.
Does it matter that King made choices that I don’t like?
