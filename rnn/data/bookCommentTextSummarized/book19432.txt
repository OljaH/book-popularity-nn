Well, since this book is pretty short, the review will be pretty short too...Here are just some basic things you need to know, and some of my reactions to them...Master Z is a mind reader :DYup, he can tell what emotions you are feeling, sometimes even your thoughts!
I'd have to seriously trust that person to go into it, and no matter how seductive his voice is or how he reads her mind, it was just a bit too much, the same night she was introduced into the lifestyle she had bondage sex with a stranger :D Well hell OK, I get even that, but (view spoiler)[after knowing each other for only TWO DAYS, they want to be exclusive, and he practically declared himself when he brought her to his house
Every once in a while a book comes along that grabs at your the literary brain cells.
Everything I've read by Cherise Sinclair (I recently finished the Mountain Masters series), and I do mean EVERYTHING has done this to me!
*GASP* I picked up some pretty good recomendations from them, then I saw where they were talking about Cherise Sinclair and her Mountain Masters and Masters of Shadowland and I felt wicked just reading the blurbs!
I couldn't understand why someone would want to read about such things as BDSM.
Master Z takes good care of Jessica, and finds she is a true "Submissive" and now isn't it just lucky that he is the purrrrfect Dom?
This was a fun introduction to the Masters of the Shadowlands series...If you follow my updates, you might have seen my surprise when I discovered that I had already read this book...
But it's not the basis for a personality.I forgot that her "charming Dom" Master Z had the whole Mind Reader thing going on......And I was reminded why this book fuzzed out in my memory.On the plus side, this was a fairly subdued and gentle introduction for the fuzzy-handcuff Erotica fans.
This reads a bit like the great opening scenes of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", with a Jessica instead of a Janet and Brad, and a Sir Z instead of a Frank N.
While this book stays rather bizarre, it doesn't stay as nicely bizarre as that classic movie.First off, screeching plotholes: such a big club doesn't of course have a phoneline, not downstairs, not on groundlevel, not in the apartment above, from where a friendly human being could actually call a taxi to take stranded Janet, errr, Jessica home.
This was like being Alice in a very twisted Wonderland...  Holy hells was that steamy!If your looking for a short,  hot  and entertaining read, look no further. Club Shadowlands pulled me in and kept me in a heat-filled daze. The writing was easy, the characters were interesting and this book was a perfect way to take a break from my depressing and masochistic reading. Rough night, Kitten? *sigh* I can never resist a man who calls his girl Kitten. Master Z was one of my favorite characters. H
The writing was easy, the characters were interesting and this book was a perfect way to take a break from my depressing and masochistic reading.
And, praise the gods, a man who actually knows what he wants and goes after it.
There was none of that "maybe she wants me...
Perfect combination if you ask me.Why the hell couldn't I be the one to have a shitty night and stumble upon his club and gorgeousness?
Master ZI really liked Jessica.
JessicaThis story was like an easy, pleasurable read without all the unnecessary drama wrapped up in a sexy packaging.
3.5 StarsYour expectations going into this book will make or break it for you. Seriously. If you expect beautiful literature or in depth character development or rational human behavior you’re going to be pissed. You’re going to scream things like this: “Haven’t you ever seen a scary movie? Do NOT go in there!” But if you go into this book expecting a fully formed BDSM fantasy you may end up screaming things more along these lines: “Yes. Yes. Give it to me. YES!” Because I went into this prepare

*grins*For such a short book there was also a great buildup of sexual tension between the main characters.
If you’re looking for a light read or an introduction into consensual BDSM this book may be just the thing for you.
Actual rating 2.5 stars.Although I didn’t give this book many stars I would not want to discourage anyone from this series.
This book in particular is light, short, and a perfect introduction into the BDSM world.
I feel the need to point out that this series might be my favorite of its genre, if only because of the way the BDSM life is reflected here.
Cherise Sinclair has a very natural and healthy way to depict this world and just because of that I love her books.
I am definitely addicted to this series and I am planning on reading every single installment that comes out.
Genre: Erotica Type: Standalone Book 1 from Masters of the ShadowlandsPOV: First Person - FemaleRating: On a cold rainy night, Jessica Randall, a plain Jane accountant, ran out of luck when her car ended up stuck in a ditch.
Never would have she realize what's behind the door was a whole another world that Master Z was more than willing to open her eyes to.I had this book on my TBR for a very long time since I first popped my BDSM cherry.
It's an introduction to the world of kink and would appeal to readers looking for a light kinky read.Books in the series:
♥♥♥ 3.25 STARS ♥♥♥This was quite the short read, but it was full of steam. It was a pretty good start to the series, but it wasn't without any flaws.The story starts off with the Jessica leaving a horrible date, and her car stranding her on a street in the pouring rain alone. She goes in search for some help when she comes across Club Shadowlands. She has no idea the nature of this club or that that night is BDSM night. This is where she meets Master Z, a Dom, she is immensely attracted to. ●  ●
It was a pretty good start to the series, but it wasn't without any flaws.The story starts off with the Jessica leaving a horrible date, and her car stranding her on a street in the pouring rain alone.
Like I mentioned before, it was a good start, but I did feel Jessica was a bit too naive.
Other than that, I really liked Master Z.
I wasn't able to feel a complete connection between these two, because I felt that they never really got to know each other completely.
There was definitely something there, but I felt that it was a bit rushed near the end.
“You may call me Sir.”Like the marines or something? “Uh, right. Exactly what kind of club is this?” I remember years ago, when I was curious about BDSM books, I have started reading this book. It is highly recommended by the experts and this series is like the epitome of BDSM romance.Anyway, I think I read about 10 pages before I fell asleep. The next night, I had a similar experience. I read about 10 pages more before I fell asleep.This book has such a tranquillity, such a peacefulness, that
It is highly recommended by the experts and this series is like the epitome of BDSM romance.Anyway, I think I read about 10 pages before I fell asleep.
This book describes ropes and crosses and spanking and orgasms and hard-core kinky sex.” But honestly Master Z was describing in such a clinical, detached way to thunderstruck Jessica the way the BDSM works and the rules; that I was feeling that I was watching a documentary from the Discovery Channel.Besides the fact that there is no angst, basically there is also no story.
Sort of the standard BDSM thing of an accidental introduction to the lifestyle.
I have read this book before.
I love reading this book.
Except it doesn't turn out to be that book.
I don't care if she signed the thing.
I don't care if Mr. Pinhead can read her mind and has decided she really wants it.
The hero sexually assaults the heroine.I wanted a nice cop to come, take her home in his squad car, whip out his handcuffs, and show her what consensual domination is supposed to be.
This read was boring to me, as I didn't connect with Master Z (Zachary) and Jessica.
Master Z was a caring, sensitive and protective Dom, Jessica was a nice and courageous (even if a bit TSTL) sub, but I didn't feel any chemistry between them.
This time, I couldn't care less.This was only my 2nd book by this author and I don't know what to make of her yet.
Since I loved The Dom's Dungeon, I can only hope the next book in this series is up to par with that one.
When Jessica finds herself stuck in her car in the middle of the storm, she seeks shelter in a private club for the night.
Unbeknownst to her, she signs in without reading the contract which outlines what kind of private club it is.
And it’s their blooming trust between one another that makes me love this book the most.
It’s a little baffling to see this development with such a short book, so I must give Sinclair a hand for this.
If this book is any indication of what to expect, then I’m in good hands.
1.5● things I liked in this book: .................● things I didn't like in this book:  ○ every single sentence on every single page; ○ heroine that is TSTL; ○ hero that feels other people's emotions and is a mind reader and obviously the smartest living creature on planet Earth; ○ did I mention extremely annoying heroine?! ○ did I mention a hero with super powers in his loins?!
In the beginning i was STILL having doubts simply because Jessica was stupid, plain and simple!...she enters a house with two strange men...signs a contract even though she hasn't read through it and really has no clue what it even is...THEN she lets a man she doesn't even KNOW...YUMMY MAN of course!..but she still doesn't know who the heck he is...undress her, bathe her and re-dress her...and not once does she try to cover herself up or push him away!
I really liked Zachary..a lot..he was very sexy and very sweet with Jessica and even though it was novella length and things usually seem very rushed...i didn't seem to feel that way with this book...
Can't wait to read about Master D and i'm really looking forward to Cullen's book too..i REALLY liked him!
Once again the "steam factor" is off the charts!The book starts off with Jessica arriving at Club Shadowlands on a dark and stormy night!!
Master Z (Zachary) is a dom who finds Jessica interesting..She ends up learning about being a sub and sees for the first time different scenarios that go on in the club.
Her and Master Z start a dom/sub relationship which eventually turns into more.This book is a good introduction into that world of BDSM..There are a bunch of glimpses into different situations going on ( whipping, caning, spanking) and I liked how Zachary and Jessica's relationship developed into more.
So this is the second book with a BDSM theme that I have read.
I must say I enjoyed it and pretty much read it in one day.
I liked the authors writing style.
It was quick and easy to read.
For me I like a little more plot in my books, but that is just personal taste and no reflection on the author.
It did end rather abruptly for me, though.
Just as it hit that climax, it ended.
For me, it felt like it needed one last chapter.
Just to tie up all the ends.
I should point out I am reviewing the series, not this particular book.
But it would essentially be the same for all books anyway.I read these when I don't want to think, when I'm bored and just wanting light entertainment.
They are basically the same thing.
Everybody is awesome, what are the chances!
Single Sexy Girl stumbles into BDSM club, Perfect Dom of her dreams sees girl and has to have her, turns out it what she needed all her life!
Everybody has millions of orgasms, everybody falls in love, everything's fantastic.
I don't hate them, they just aren't a serious read.

Like, fucked up along the lines of Fifty Shades of Grey.
I didn't even read the synopsis.
She meets the owner, instant 'oh he is hot, i wonder what it would be like to ride him' kind of attraction going on between them.
This book has only sex in it.
Some scenes where super hot i admit, but the rest in my opinion where either ridiculous, or just....wrong and super fucked up.
So if you like that kind of stuff and short BDSM stories you will really enjoy Club Shadowlands, otherwise...stay away, LOL.
Club Shadowlands is NOT one of my favorite Cherise Sinclair books, that's for sure.
I did like Master Z's character but I never fully warmed up to Jessica's character.
I also had a hard time believing Jessica to be a submissive.
The heroine remained to obstinate and dubious throughout this book for me to buy into her submissive nature.
Club Shadowlands is well written and insightful book that gives the reader a basic understanding of the BDSM lifestyle.
However, I felt this book lack that special romantic element I've come to expect from Ms. Sinclair books.
3.5 Stars!  "I do. And I think it's time you gave me your number.""What would you do with my number?""Call you and ask you out to dinner. Talk to you somewhere besides in bed, much as I enjoy having you here.""Do I call you Sir at a restaurant?""No, kitten." ..."I'm Zachary until we reach the club...or the bedroom."   Been a while since I read some BDSM genre! Wasn't so bad! This one was enjoyable read. And, OH MAN, the sex was..
It is romantically inclined - the Dominant men we're introduced to don't want just another sub, but something more long-lasting and meaningful: love, and whatever comes with it.That said, we don't really get to know Jessica or Master Z - Zach - in depth, but we do get a good sense of their characters, and come to like them, from their interactions.
Master Z can read people's emotions, which puts him in an excellent position of running a club like this - and being a popular Dom. This gives him an edge and is what enables things to move quite fast between him and Jessica.
You should know before reading my review that BDSM isn't my thing. It is way out of my comfort zone and although I may believe that everyone has a right to get off however they want I still cringe every time S&M is mentioned. So, you probably realize what a surprise it was to me that I enjoyed this book so much. If it had more of a plot it would be a solid 5.**************SPOILERS************** Master Z Z was so damn hot. He had this overly protective personality combined with a bit of an ed
The couple didn't begin picking wedding invitations and confess their undying feelings after two days of f***ing each other silly.Generally the book was good and if there was some kind of plot lost in all the sex it would be a 5 but there wasn't one anywhere.************2nd time around************I'm going to change the rating to 5.
The things that made me give it 4 stars the last time around are still there but I just love reading this book so I'm not going to hold back.
I've never felt uncomfortable with anything that I've read thus far in the erotica/BDSM genre.
I was also very surprised that I've never read a single review that alludes to what happens in the first 'scene' between Master Z and Jessica.
Jessica is given no safe word, and not even the illusion of a choice in the matter.
Aside from that, I really enjoyed the rest of the book.
The mind reading thing kind of threw me.
I don't know if I've just gotten lucky with these types of books that I've read so far.
She stumbles across a private club where she meets the swoon-worthy Master Z, who leads her on a gentle exploration of the kinky side of sex and teaches her to push her boundaries and live a little.I quite enjoyed this book.
Enjoyed discovering through Jessica different kinks that I would be OK with, enjoyed the dual gentle and dominating nature that is Master Z, loved the sweet things that came out of his mouth that made me wish like hell there were more guys out there like him.
But as it is a series, I'm guessing I'll get more glimpses of this couple with the next few books.Overall, a great and fun read.
That's the story the notorious Master Z gets? I'm disappointed. Nothing new, nothing special. Rushed, no decent beginning, no buildup, straight to the sex. Heroine was very annoying. A lot of " I uhm.. But I... What are you... No, I'm uh...".In this story, it felt like I have been in that club a thousand times. Same surroundings, same people, nothing exiting.I know that Sinclair could have done better than this. Mediocre at best.
This book was dramatically better than I was expecting. I was so pleasantly surprised. Cherise Sinclair completely won me over. I have never read a book about BDSM that was so careful to protect its readers from real life BDSM gone wrong.
Do you remember how it started on that dark and stormy night?
They arrive soaked and are told that there is a private party going on?
She is told that a private party is going on and she would not be able to stay.
Jessica figures that she has nothing better to do, so she signs the papers without reading them and enters the party.I really enjoyed how the author portrayed this particular lifestyle.
I also melted when Master Z called Jessica Kitten.
My only disappointment is that the next book in the series does not continue Zachary and Jessica's story.
But oh boy, picking this book was such a mistake.Shortly after you start reading, they tell you the moto is SAFE, SANE AND CONSENSUAL.
They told her she had to sign some paper to join and be able to get inside, and she fucking did because she was freezing and needed HELP.
Well, main girl, that will teach you to be more of a bitch and let people fix their own problems next time.She had stopped a scene.
The people there knew about her situation and still forced her to endure the punishment, because she had signed the papers, duh!Safe, sane and consensual, right?
