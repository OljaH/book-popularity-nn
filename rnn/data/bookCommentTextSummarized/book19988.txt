You know it's hard to hate Katniss for being the object of the whole love triangle.
I totally love this because frankly that is what it's like in real life.
Peeta and Gale are both incredible guys and what makes them so great is that they both are good  friends , something that is lacking in other books at times.
Don't get me wrong there is a lot more to the series than the love triangle.
Later added: For those of you who didn't know there is a movie coming out for the first book The Hunger Games!
I went to see Inglourious Basterds a couple of times this past month, and there is that scene where Eli Roth and Omar Doom are in the theater, and they dress themselves up to look like waiters and then whip around the corner and kill the two Nazi guards to some funny Ennio Morriconi(ish?), spaghetti-western sounding music.
It’s one of those great story-telling moments where I’m nice and comfortable and morally superior, until I realize that actually I’m exactly the same as someone I think is Evil.
I think Suzanne Collins’s books should be taught in high school social studies classes, so maybe we could get some young brains working on this problem.
I read Hunger Games #1 yesterday, and loved it.
They add nothing to the plot, and they're only a device used to portrayl how ULTRA FUCKING SPESHUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND DESIRABLE THE MARY SUE MC IS.There's a love triangle in this book, and it was perfect.
If a book has to have a love triangle, this is how it should be done.
Despite Peeta's long-time crush on Katniss, she doesn't return his feelings, and in fact, held him at arm's length, under deep suspicion until he proves himself.So yes, I approve of this motherfucking love triangle.
(A-) 82% | Very GoodNotes: It's about futility, and dealing with the unintentional effects of compliance, pretense, decency, altruism, and kissing.
I think I wouldn't be feeling quite so disappointed by this book if The Hunger Games hadn't been quite so close to perfect.
Where The Hunger Games is a tightly-plotted, fast-paced dystopian thriller heaped with romance and horror, this book is...
A WHOLE lot of the same plot.
Too much of the story is told rather than shown -- whole months can go by in just a few pages -- and yet the real action gets rolling about two thirds of the way through the book.
That said, this is an ARC and things could change.
Collins is obviously capable of great things.
He recognizes that it is necessary to give the subjects of his government some hope, but Katniss and Peeta have provided a spark to the tinder of popular resentment, and Snow needs to forestall a conflagration.The author Katniss is not in a good place back in District 12 after the games.
Katniss, by defying the Capitol in Book I and by her actions this time, has become the face of popular resistance, whether potential or kinetic.There are contemporary issues that resonate as well.
The pressure is unspeakable as the President, in order to save his own face, is insisting that she and Peeta make good on their cover story from their first game together.
As new characters are cast, I will post the actor's pictures here along with the images I find that imitate how they might look as the character they will be playing.LATEST UPDATES ON CASTINGWOWZA!The best photoshopped pic I have seen of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss:So we officially have our Peeta:Okay, I just want to say that, while Josh is not what I had pictured, I trust those in charge.
Once again, as long as they work their studio magic on his looks, he should do just fine.Willow Shields as PRIMROSE EVERDEENPaula Malcomson (of SyFy's Caprica) as Mrs. Everdeen![image error]Elizabeth Banks will be playing Effie TrinketWoody Harrelson is officially our HAYMITCH!!!The guy is awesome.
The one thing I didn't like about this book is the part where Katniss finds out she has to go back to the Hunger Games.
The book started moving at a really fast pace after that point, with Katniss and Peeta preparing for the next Games, and I was like "wait, what?
hang on a minute!" It was hard for me to believe that Katniss would willingly go back to the arena, at least not without major depression.
I like that she has some makeout time on the beach with Peeta, though.6.
I was like, this government needs to be overthrown, Tally Youngblood-style.7.
Like hanging on for dear life by a spider web thin thread totally butt naked (you know that makes it worse)!
It’s really hard to summarize a book when you’re afraid that everything you say will give away the twist.
I could probably name off a bunch of things that bothered me about the book (I think I mentioned how I HAAAATE love triangles with a burning passion) but you really care about the characters.
You see, this is the type of thinking you have after reading the book.

the pacing is way off, the plotting is mechanical, the characterization is lazy, and the 'game' section is just lame.
plot!
plot!
it's actually kind of a shame b/c collins is terrific at coming up with story & plot elements, she's just kinda inept at assembling and executing 'em.
they've gotta be the same people who also cram political sites full of this kinda shit:'obama is way worse then bush!
wait till he takes away you're right to bare arms!!!'don't ya think?well, (as if you didn't see this coming), on to book 3.
The 9 months that Katniss spends in District 12 only serves to let us know that uprisings are occuring and she has been targeted by The Captial, all of which could have been summed up in a chapter or two.Second, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that about 90% of those of us who read and loved Hunger Games were team Peeta all the way.
There were moments where I would catch a glimpse of what made me love Hunger Games, and for that I give this book three stars.
See, along with other people asking questions (I didn't compile these) along with the slew of 'maybes' (please refer to a rundown of this later in my review) and the lack of anything interesting happening - this novel is a prime candidate for, I don't know, being used as toilet paper.
I couldn't bear to NOT share the following with you.Katniss takes it upon herself to question everybody, everywhere"You're hideous, you know that right?"; "Walk?"; "Did Cinna come early to help me get ready?"; "There have been uprisings?"; "Why don't you just kill me now?" "Who says I'm not?"; "What do you mean?

Another enjoyable entry in the Hunger Games Saga! Soon I can pretend that I didn't wait forever to read these because I'll have flown through. Full review to come.
If you are reading this I am assuming you have read the first book.Katniss & Peeta Controversially win the 74th Hunger games.
Can Katness defy the Capital again?This book is less action packed then the first but a lot more emotional.
Katniss is more herself in this book rather surly, bad tempered, emotional.
Peeta is her polar opposite likable by everyone, managing to rally everyone with his words; I think Katniss even admits he would be a better revolution leader then she ever wood so she is determined to martyr herself so he can live.
But really, in this terrible dystopian world, I think things had to get worse for Katniss before she decided that something had to be done.
Her second worst nightmare happens: she's going back in the arena.
I totally remember the first read through around that that was the last thing I expected.
Your time is short.
Totally not what I expected, but a good story.
Although not as jaw-droppingly good as the first book.
Still, a good 'middle' book, for what I expect to be a trilogy.
Provided a little more backstory, and certainly a lot more foreshadowing of what will be happening next.
Every so often, I select a Young Adult book to read.
I just mean the thrill of trying to guess who the killer is and who's gonna go next is the fun part...
THAT is a fun book.So I had to read The Hunger Games.
But OMG, when book 2 came out and Peeta and Katniss where back in the contest, I think I died and went to...
It may totally be commercial young adult fiction, but if it gets you to read, it's a good thing.
I think it's a must read!
One taught me love
Catching Fire and Mockingjay didn't come close to the high it gave the first time we read it.Katniss flashback of Gale:Nice Natalie: *sigh* Remember when we used to be Team Gale?Cynical Natalie: I prefer to leave that memory in the murky marshes with Twihard tween Natalie.
Moving on!Katniss/Peeta pearl scene:Cynical Natalie: This scene is problematic.
How's that different from Christian Grey using his dick to silence Ana?Nice Natalie: We don't know much about Peeta's family life since Katniss never bothered to find out.
Katniss isn't good with words, she's all about action.The ending:Nice Natalie: MY FEELS ARE RUNNETH OVER.Cynical Natalie: Why are you talking like you're in a Shakespeare play?After reading:Nice Natalie: Five stars.
I hated the effect it had on me because this books is terrible and not worthy of my enthralment.
I hated the first book, and to have it repeated on myself again was frustrating and poor taste.
In the last games it was clear that they had accidently created a beacon of hope, though I don’t know why anybody would be inspired by Katniss Everdeen.
Why not simply kill Katniss and make it look like an accident?
Her internal monologue is completely terrible; it’s like the author doesn’t know how to write down someone’s thoughts.
it doesnt read like teen fiction at all.
when i got to the end of the first one and saw "the end of book one" i got mad because i thought this would be one of those things that goes on forever and i have no desire for that kind of commitment.
her other series (which i havent read) did something like 5 books and stopped, so i appreciate her understanding that when something is finished, it doesnt need to be milked forever.
now i gotta go read an adult book, just so i know i still can...come to my blog!
So I've finished the book and all I can say is: wow! Catching fire has broken my heart with the events that have unfolded and I am desperately holding out for more. As usual, the writing is flawless, the characters beyond fantastic and the plot will leave you on the edge of your seat. This is, hands down, my favourite series... Ever!
Don’t you hate it when you accidentally start a political uprising?Katniss survived the Hunger Games, but she’s inadvertently become a symbol of defiance that is inspiring some in the twelve Districts to begin pushing back against the despotic Capital.
Snow’s revenge is to pull her back into another round in the arena to shut her up once and for all.I was impressed with the first half of the book which did not try copy the first book’s pattern, but instead put Katniss into a new situation of reluctantly trying to carry out Snow‘s commands to help quash the burgeoning political discontent.
I nibbled at it for a few days because I was busy with other things but once the weekend came, I did little else until it was finished.
Taking up where The Hunger Games left off, author Collins continues using the first person, present tense narrative but the story is expanded as Katniss gets to see more of the behind the scenes action in other districts and in the Capital.
This is excellent story telling not just in how it is told but in Collins' exceptional imagination.
I joined the millions of others who went on to read Mockingjay and finish the series.
Yadda yadda, lots of violence, and then a bad guy turns out to be good and Katniss and Co. are all rescued from the arena, save for Peeta, who's been horribly abducted by the Capitol (tears for that).Let's start with the love triangle, which this book pretty frequently relies on to supply tension.
I better felt who Katniss was in this book, and as such, I felt like I could grow to care about Peeta and Gale as characters, though not as love interests - like I said before, I could've cared less who Katniss ended up with because none of the romantic relationships ever really interested me.
It did lack the perfect pacing of the first book, the first half was a little slow and for some time I wasn't sure where it was going, but it picked up immensely in the later part.
I am dying to get my hands on the last 3rd book!P.S. If before reading "Catching Fire" I was concerned whether I would be able to stay on Team Peeta with more time given to Gale, I am not any more...Update 8/23/10.
“My nightmares are usually about losing you. I'm okay once I realize you're here.” Catching Fire is the best of the series even though I re-read it this time, I still insist that it's such a gut-wrenching story to read. What happens in CF is beyond cruelty, Katniss is not supposed to return to the nightmare she once escaped. I pitited her so much from the start; I could sense something deep inside her heart waiting to crumble. The story had dragged me along until the end and I was satisfied by
Catching Fire is the best of the series even though I re-read it this time, I still insist that it's such a gut-wrenching story to read.
What happens in CF is beyond cruelty, Katniss is not supposed to return to the nightmare she once escaped.
President Snow also has a big part in this book, I could see he's not a normal person with posion dripping from his heart.
I literally favored his character and how he manage to get rid of Katniss made this book more interesting.
“We had to save you because you're the mockingjay, Katniss," says Plutarch.
Katniss being the field is the best scene ever!
President Snow expresses his displeasure with Katniss in the only way he knows how.
In a lot of ways, it feels like a transitional book.
In some others, it feels like a rehash of the first one.I liked seeing how the Hunger Games changed the lives of Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of District 12.
I also liked that Haymitch's past was explored a bit.
The growing unrest really makes this feel like a transitional book.
It almost feels like the Empire Strikes Back at times.
(hide spoiler)]Still, I didn't like it as much as I did the first book.
This was just as much fun the second time around! Easily my favorite installment in this series. But now all I have left is The Mockingjay & I distinctly remember my disappointment in the finale. *grimaces as ominous music plays*RTC.Buddy read this with Chelsea & Wren! 🙌🏽💕
