** FULL SPOILER FREE REVIEW NOW POSTED ** The Edge of Always  perfectly recaptured that special "feeling" from the first book, stayed true to the characters and told a beautiful story filled with romance, adventure and emotional depth.
The Edge of Never was truly one of my most favorite books of 2012 and it ended in such a beautiful way that I was completely happy with the story and a little worried to read more because I didn't want these characters I'd come to love so dearly to be put through any unnecessary drama.
Life has a way to fulfill your dreams and take them away unexpectedly.
Only by believing and keep dreaming you can make the most and live your life that you have always wanted.Camryn & Andrew, 2 kids, have suffered, have dreamt, have conquered their fears and overcome death to be together.
Two lost souls that met by chance and fell in love by fate after the heart-pounding and deeply romantic The Edge of Never, are together and they have many difficult decisions to take.
While I liked it and I was thrilled to read this book, somehow my expectations overwhelmed me and I couldn't loved it.
Andrew wants to spice up their lives because Camryn acts like a dead person and he’s not regularly getting laid worried about her state of health and their relationship.
Huh. Maybe that’s why (view spoiler)[ the author jumped right from present day Camryn and Andrew to fifteen years later where the kid grew up.
I got this feeling the author rushed to finish the story and slapped on an epilogue for good measure.All this being said though, there were traces of EPIC scenes scattered throughout the book, and these alone helped me power through (or I would have DNF’ed it).

‘I promise to love you forever in this life and wherever we go in the afterlife, because I know I can’t go on in any life unless you’re in it too.’ ‘You’re the other half of me that I know I can never live without.’‘Where else would I be than wherever you are?’
There were many things I loved about this book.
Andrew and Camryn’s love is like a journey.
They are passionate, full of love and life.
Andrew and Camryn’s story will forever be unforgettable to me.
Didn't see that coming.EXCERPTCamryn shrieks and I start laughing as we dash away from the cows and toward the car.“Awww, shiiiit!” I yell when I step in a huge pile of it.Camryn cackles with laughter and we both practically stumble the rest of the way through the field, me trying to scrape the shit off the bottom of my shoe while running at the same time and Camryn’s flip-flops getting caught on the ground trying to keep up with her feet.“I can’t believe that just happened!” Camryn laughs as we finally make it back to the car.
Joint review with Kristen/Splage posted at: Swept Away By RomanceKristen: 3  StarsSplage: 3  StarsWhat workedKristen says: One of the things I loved about this book is the amazing characterizations. J. A. Redmerski has a uncanny ability to write characters and dialogue that are so full of life and humanity that they seemingly jump off the pages.I also loved the road trip. It was fun being on the road with Camryn and Andrew again.Splage says: I am going to start by saying that I chose The Edge of
I can’t really say too much about it because would give lots away, but after reading it (plus the last third before it) I jumped my rating ½ a point to 3.5 stars.Favorite character(s)Kristen says: I loved, loved, loved Andrew's character in this story.
I struggle to stay interested and connected during the first half of the book, and even though I loved the characters and the ending, for me, it didn't have the same impact as The Edge of Never (one of my favorite books of 2012).
~ 3.5 Stars!Splage says: Even though The Edge of Always didn’t live up to book 1 (I think that was an impossible task in my eyes), it still was a good read.
**Grinning from ear to ear**
EXCERPT AND MORE - > HERE Edging to a disappointing 3.5 starsThis will be a difficult review to write.
I loved The Edge of Never, it was a six star read for me and a top on my list of favorites.
I have been waiting F.O.R.E.V.E.R for The Edge of Always and as much as it pains me to say this, I was left disappointed.I need to first put this out there.
There are a lot of five star reviews for The Edge of Always and I can understand that.
It’s just a matter of taste and personal preference.
The sequel did not affect me like the five star reviewers and I guess when it comes down to it, if an author is going to write a sequel on a couple you absolutely love, what can the author write about that will hold your interest?I love Andrew and Cam. I love Andrew period and yes one of the reasons is because he has the same name as my husband.
If I want to slap anyone in a book, it’s the downfall for me.Now, there’s other things that go on and at one point (we all know what I am talking about, if you have read it) I was kind of like, oh yeah this is perking my interest!
My Thoughts: ♫ It was great being back with one of my favorite couples, Andrew and Camryn, and even though I didn't think it was as good as the first book, it was still very enjoyable.♫ Of course, what I thought might happen, happened and it certainly lead to some drama but I liked how Andrew and eventually Camryn handled things. ♫ I loved, loved, loved the road trip! I think that's one of my favorite things! ♫ But what in the heck happened in Florida? That was sooo crazy and seemed a little po

But plans can change anytime and when tragedy knocks at their door, they must deal with the most difficult path they probably had to walk through.And find out the place they want to belong in the world… when the world doesn’t seem like a good place to be anymore.
I really liked this book.
I’m sure you know that feeling.But do I think that you should read it?
And WHY AREN’T YOU READING IT??!)It was not a bad book, far from it, it was pretty damn good… just not as much as the first.
Go read this now, Andrew Parrish is a book-boyfriend you really can’t miss!
***Warning: This review contains huge spoilers for The Edge of Never***  In five months I found myself with him, fell in total, unconitional crazy love, truly learned how to live, met pactically his entire family and quickly felt like a prt of them, went through a life- and- death journey with Andrew, got pregnant and engaged. All in five months' time. And now here we are facing another hardship. And he's still with me every step of the way.  And Andrew is back!! Give me a moment here.. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥

Now, there comes a time in a person's life when you have to face something so horrible that you feel like you'll never be the same person again.
***My song for Andrew and Camryn is Between the Raindrops by Lifehouse ft.
“Our story is over, yes, but our journey isn't, because we'll always live on the edge until the day we die.”  Andrew Parrish... Need I say more?!I love this guy! Cam- "Andrew has always amazed me. He amazed me with the way his mind worked. The way he could look at me without saying anything and make me feel like the most important person in the world. He amazed me with how he could always be so positive even when life was falling apart around him. And how he could make a light shine in the dark
“Our story is over, yes, but our journey isn't, because we'll always live on the edge until the day we die.” 
With a baby on the way the road and traveling isn't an option.When something so sad and unfortunate happens Cam, looses herself and Andrew being themost awesome Fiancé in history decides that they need to do what they love...
Cam and Andrew on the road again with special moments, lots of love, passionand great laughsThey find themselves back in New Orleans- a sense of dejavu overcomes them.
"Our story is over, yes, but our journey isn’t, because we’ll always live on the edge until the day we die."
Camryn needs to come to terms with EVERYTHING, including her greatest fear.'The Edge of Always,' is about a deep, deep love....
I think a slow detailed burn is the authors writing style.
I like how her books make me feel by the end..
Andrew was the driving force for me, him and his beautiful relationship with Camryn....I love the sentiment behind the book, it's life affirming; makes you think about living in the moment, facing your fears and making everything count.
4.5 Andrew/Cam Witty Naughty Emotional Stars “I feel free with you, I feel like I can do anything. Go anywhere. Be anything that I want.” _Camryan ‘I promise to love you forever in this life and wherever we go in the afterlife, because I know I can’t go on in any life unless you’re in it too.’ -------------------------------------full Review to come!THIS JUST ...... *GOOD BYE*
Review to come <333
3.5 Stars I couldn't get enough of "The Edge Of Never" so had to read this one. Did I love it as much? No, it fell a bit short of my expectations, but "The Edge Of Never" was a very hard act to follow. Still this was a decent read, was about romance, my favorite genre, and kept me turning the pages ;)
:'(He's hotter in my head thought.He was taking the long road.
She was taking the road to nowhere.
They fell in love and proved that when two people are meant to be together, fate will find a way to make it happen.Now, in the highly anticipated sequel to THE EDGE OF NEVER, Camryn and Andrew are pursuing their love for music and living life to the fullest as they always swore to do.
As Camryn tries to numb her pain, Andrew makes a bold decision: To get their life back on track, they’ll set out on another cross-country road trip.
"You're the world to me," I whisper onto her lips. "I hope you never forget that.""I'll never forget that... But if I ever do, for whatever reason, I hope you'll always find a way to remind me.""Always..." 5-STAR WORTHY!!!Beautiful love story. Simply amazing.I don't think this book could have been written any better.Andrew and Camryn's another spontaneous expedition... The Edge of Always exceeded my expectations. Once again, J.A. Redmerski made me fall in love with the characters that I fell in
Once again, J.A. Redmerski made me fall in love with the characters that I fell in love with a year ago.The Edge of Always narrates another journey of Andrew and Camryn's life.
Why I love the story of Andrew and Camryn the most is because it never fails to captivate me.
I wanted to cry happy tears when I finished it because the ending couldn't have been more perfect.I don't think there will be any fictional characters in the future that I will love as much as I love Andrew and Camryn.
I felt like there were alot of ideas and stories that got started in this book but then just got dropped.
I also felt a disconnect between Andrew and Camryn.
(hide spoiler)]This book, for the most part, had me wondering where the hell did Camryn from the first book go?I felt like I was reading about a totally different character.
She seemed completely self absorbed only invested in her own feelings and never once asking Andrew his.The book was so focused on Camryn's reaction to it that it seemed like Andrew was almost forgotten.
**** 3  Fast Paced Stars **** ARC provided by Grand Central Publishing via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I’m a bit confused on how to word this review since I am currently sitting on fence questioning whether to tilt to the left (liked) or tilt to the right (disliked).

I was so excited to be chosen to read an ARC of this book since I fell in love with Camryn and Andrew in “The Edge of Never”.I think what has me leaning to the right is that the book skips so fast from days to weeks to months and then a mess of years.
They have their ups and downs on this journey both psychically and mentally while they experience the wonderful love they shared through the first book.I was happy to have read this book and have the story of Camryn and Andrew completed.
"THE EDGE OF NEVER" was such a profound, emotionally driven tale, I wasn’t sure if continuing Andrew and Camryn’s story would hold the same level of excellence.
Road trip!Their journey to healing Cam and Andrew dealing with his own demons was a lovely story, but it did not hold the angst element as the first installment.
Dealing with his own hardships, Andrew looked deep within his soul to find the courage needed to be Cam’s rock.
As always, it is Andrew’s love and fearlessness that heals Camryn’s broken spirit.
Like Orpheus and Eurydice, Andrew and Cam’s story is a “tragic tale of true love”.
I looove the 1st book much more than this but still It was really nice to read a little more about Andrew & Camryn! :)
YAY!!! MORE CAM AND ANDREW!!!!OH-MY-GAWWWWD!!! YAY!!   NOVEMBER 5, 2013 RELEASE DATE!
4.5/5 stars This book didn't impress me as much as the first one. Especially the first 146 pages which were really annoying. But again, the ending was so perfect... so peaceful. It totally changed my perspective on the book. I was so sad when I read about Lily... but she came to life into another Lily. (This might sound crazy, but if you read the book, you'll understand). Anyway, this series was so addictive. I can't believe I read both books in one day... But once I started to read about Andrew and Camryn, it was impossible to stop.
I really feel like I should give it 2 stars but there were glimpses of the same characters I so fell in love with in the first book I decided to bump up my rating.
I thought maybe it was just me so I took a Because I wanted to love this book so much I thought maybe I just wasn't feeling it and I need to revisit it another time.
Like I said there glimpses of the same magic from book one but it wasn't even close to being enough to make this one good.
“Our story is over, yes, but our journey isn't, because we'll always live on the edge until the day we die.”  I didn't enjoy it as much as TEON but I still love Andrew and Cam's story. I love their love of life and attitude towards being themselves and not conforming to others expectations. This book was very philosophical just like the first and makes you think and question so much about yourself. I was an absolute blubbering mess of happy tears for the last few chapters and that epilogue was

I'm so glad I got to experience Andrew and Camryn's beautiful story with them and it's something that I'll always cherish!
I absolutely adore Andrew, he IS my favourite book boyfriend!!!
I won't do a big to-do about it. I feel like.... It was a 3.5 star read for me at best. It was just too slow and too long for me this time around. I don't know maybe it would have been better to not even continue it. I didn't feel like anything happened that I could not have imagined would have been their story and yeah.... for the most part it was just a big ol' snooze fest...
5 EXTREMELY SWEET AND INSANELY SEXY HEARTS! "You think we're lost?"I tilt my head back a little and look up at the stars behind her and say, "In society, maybe. But together, no. I think we're right where we need to be." REACTION AFTER READING THE BOOKMy heartIs just full of happiness right now!To date, The Edge of Never and now The Edge of Always easily became my favorite book of all time.Before I start and share my passionate love for this book. I'll start with a short GISTJust when things are
Fell in love.They both didn't have any idea how that would change their life forever.A few months after their roadtrip together, Camryn and Andrew couldn't be more happier.Things was starting to fall together.They made plans for their future.They made arrangements.They had to as they were expecting a baby girl along the way.But something happened.Something unexpected that pushed Camryn over the edge.She tries to hide it like she did a thousand times before but this time Andrew was there.He was there to make sure Camryn doesn't go through her struggles alone.He wasn't going to let her go.He wasn't going to let her fall apart without him.He was going to be there for her no matter what happens.Even if it kills him.OVERALL THOUGHTSI just thought this book was really beautiful.Both of them are.
"Our story is over, yes, but our journey isn't, because we'll always live on the edge until the day we die."  OH. MY. GOD! ANDREW PARRISH = Perfect. Man. *sigh*Andrew & Camryn takes us once again to another journey of their lives into a whole new level! After experiencing loss and “moment of weakness”, Andrew will take another risk to get Camryn back to where they belong: On the road. (of course the Chevelle is taking another trip of a lifetime with them!) "Because this is our life. We met
Lol 			 *********************This series taught me a lot of things: To live life the fullest, never regret the decision you made, to never take a second of it for granted because any second could be your last, to be free-spirited and driven and in love with the World.
The things that Andrew & Camryn went through together, I can’t help but be awed by them.
They inspire me and how I wish in the future, I can do those things they did around the world.J.A Redmerski really did a stunning series and I’m still tearing up to pieces because I’m going to miss Andrew & Camryn so much.
