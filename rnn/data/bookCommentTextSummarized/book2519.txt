This isn't just a book about culture, it's a profound guide to life.
Certain chapters in the second half of the book, on Nature, reading, and love, rank among the best things ever written in my view, with many paragraphs similar to the beautiful passages found in his fiction.
The Meaning of Culture is also essential in understanding JC Powys' fiction, particularly Wolf Solent, which was completed around the same time, as the attitudes of the main character, and even the way the book is written, reflects much of TMOC.
I found it far for applicable to my life than any other "life guide" out there.
The Meaning of Culture is an old fashioned guide to personal development through reading and the appreciation of the arts. It illustrates for me what Susan Cain describes as the culture of character, the old school of self-help that championed inner development, rather than our modern self-help culture of personality, where we emphasize enthusiasm and charisma.
This was the first book like this I read. I was in junior high. It was a difficult read the first time, but I went back to it often. This book has had a profound effect on my life and attitudes.
