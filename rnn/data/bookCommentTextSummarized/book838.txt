I got through undergrad pretending to understand Kant, but now I actually do! This books is *fabulous* although it did take me almost six months to read- very slow going! Cassirer is an unapologetic Kant enthusiast, but he does speak of Kant's contemporary critics enough to understand various sides of the arguments.

Although it provides a clear analysis of some of Kant's denser works (which may rank with Hegel, Sartre, and Husserl as the "densest" philosophical writings ever), Cassirer focuses too much on Kant's life and passes over major developments in his actual philosophy.
For instance, the keystone of his life and of his philosophy--Critique of Pure Reason--is actually hurried through at points, in an attempt to tie it more closely with his later works.
Moreover, the development of Kant's moral philosophy is given relatively short shrift, in favor of extended passages on the general reception of his works throughout his career.
I came to this looking to hear more about Kant's Leben, but got too much Lehre.
This is not a good biography book per se, but is more concerned with aspects of Cassirer's interest in Kant's ideas.
