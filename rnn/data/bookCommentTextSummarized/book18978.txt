This book is now definitely in my top 10 favorite King books (if not the top 5)Seems like this one is even frequently skipped by King fans - please, stop skipping and read!This book has a great story and great characters.
It is quick and easy to read and kept me interested every page.
Blaze is a flawed but easy to sympathize tragic hero who doesn't really know what he is doing, but thinks he is doing it for the best.
OMG........I cannot believe how good this book is.......well, there were a couple things that bothered me in the narration sequence, particularly the final flash from the past, but I'm still surprised at the overall low ratings.This is not your typical Stephen King (Richard Bachman) read, as a matter of fact, King did not originally think it worthy of being published, but be prepared, there are scary times, a kind of horror of a different sort you might say, that caused me multiple OH NO!
MEMORY is a short bonus read that follows BLAZE about two horrible accidents one of which is a lead-in to KING'S novel DUMA KEY that was published back in 2008.
Aided by the voice of his dead friend George in his head, a slow goliath named Blaze kidnaps an infant and holds him for ransom.
Can Blaze hold things together long enough to collect the ransom?Blaze is a straight up crime book from Stephen King, aside from the voice of George in Blaze's head, which might not even be supernatural in origin.
I found Blaze's past way more interesting than his kidnapping scheme, which had some ludicrous moments due to Blaze not really knowing what he was doing.
Even more tears!! 😭 full review to come...
Unfortunately, without George's brains to think through the plotting, Blaze's plan can't possibly end well.The climax is fairly predictable - we know from the beginning that this poor sap never had a chance, so there isn't much suspense about how it's all going to turn out.
But King, in his marvelous way when he's focusing on characterization and writing relatively economically, sketches out the life and personality of Clayton Blaisdell, Jr. for us, until we see him as a human being, a good guy in a bad place who made bad choices through little fault of his own, but mostly was just kicked around by a harsh, unfeeling world.
And I didn't like the two main characters; not even Blaze, who is soft in the head (I am sorry if that sounds inhuman to say, but it is how I felt), and I thought that he isn't an interesting character, as far as I've read.
I just didn't care about anyone and anything.Also, I need to say that I was very excited to read Blaze, especially since I was buddy-reading it with Mrs. Janie, from Bookworms Buddy, who is a fantastic Booktuber .
Anyway, I need to say that this is my first Stephen King book that I am not putting hold for a future reading (just because I couldn't get into it at this reading) ...
The dent in his forehead might make him look scary, but we soon learn that Blaze isn't much of a threat -- except when he's really angry.
When he meets George Rackley, Blaze learns the art of the con.
That big job would be kidnapping the baby of a rich couple, collecting the ransom, and living the high-life somewhere with white sandy beaches and lots of sun.
For another, Blaze, as we've already learned, isn't the smartest guy around.
What follows is a mixture of present day mystery/thriller as Blaze carries out the kidnapping of little Joey, mixed with the flashbacks of his life that show how Blaze ends up where he's at.

We know that Blaze has done some bad things throughout his life, and that he's about to do something even worse, but King makes him a sympathetic character from the very start, and then increases the reader's sympathy with each subsequent flashback chapter.
King wrote Blaze when he was just starting out, and it never would have been published if he hadn't continued to revisit it and decide to share it with his Constant Readers.
I believe his characters, care about them, and, even through the unbelievable worlds and situations through which these palpable characters inhabit and experience, believe them.In "Blaze," which was originally written at a very young age, sat on the back burner for 25+ years, and fortunately revisited the author after his "retirement," King is - in my opinion - at his best creating a situational plot line that follows two amazing characters blurring the lines of ethical/unethical, right/wrong, and nature/nuture.I recommend this relatively short book to anyone interested in a good story and a great character.
I'm not sure why King felt compelled to publish this after so many years and certainly not why he contributed it to Bachman - a pseudonym that wasn't even born when the original draft was written (at least I think, please correct me if I'm wrong).
Re-written and heavily expanded by King now but still a Bachman?
Also - wasn't one purpose of the pseudonym to find out if the writer's success could be accounted for by any other means than his making himself a name?, i.e. would he still sell books under another name?
Am I the only person on the map to not know Stephen King's early pseudonym was Richard Bauchman?
Blaze continuously talks with George throughout the snatching of a six month old baby, but the twist you learn early on is that George is actually dead and only speaking to him in his head.Oooo, human psychology..I was only drawn to the story because of a group reading challenge which asked that we each do a book that surrounded a kidnapping.
If you are a big fan of Stephen King's, you might want to add this to your repertoire.
Buen libro de King bajo su seudónimo de Richard Bachman. Es muy entretenido, ameno, fluido y rápido ; sin embargo, hay alguna que otra parte que se me hizo un poco pesada y quizás hasta monótona. Es curioso que con el personaje principal de esta historia llegás a sentir una especie amor-odio. Tiene un buen final; a muchos no les gustó, tal vez no fuese el mejor, pero es aceptable, y arriesgado. Me encanta que los autores se arriesguen con las conclusiones. En fin, buena novela de King, para pasar un rato agradable.
An earlier work by Stephen King but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending sucked me in and I just couldn't stop reading it until I finished. A sure sign of outstanding writing. I would recommend this one.
this book brought me tears and laughter with moving pathos and humorsk had the wonder of using different approaches to achieve equally satisfactory results like Of Mice and Menif i were a director directing an sk's novel, this book would be my first choice!
2- 2.5 Stars.I just kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. This felt like Stephen King-lite. Yawn. Not a fan of this story.
Ο Steph... Ο Richard Backman ήθελα να πω ... μας δίνει ένα μικρό διαμάντι αν και λίγο ακατέργαστο , εδώ όμως είναι και η ομορφιά του ! Ακολουθούμε έναν άνθρωπο , δεν τον λες και σπιρτουλη , να προσπαθεί να πιάσει την καλή , και στη διαρκεία να μας φανερώνει σιγά σιγά το ποσο συμπαθητικός είναι . Ολοκληρωμένοι χαρακτήρες που σε κάνουν να θες να πετύχουν ακόμα και τα χειρότερα πράγματα. Ο συγγραφέας αποδεικνύει ότι μπορεί να γράψει πολλά είδη , και με πολλά ψευδώνυμα , με επιτυχία !
Sometimes after finishing (and during) a SK novel I talk to myself in the persona of one of the characters for a little while - true story!
I just came to recognise this as something I do whilst talking to myself in the style of George (a character from this book).
I don't know when it started, and I don't think I do it with other authors - which indicates to me that King's character creation is second to none (or that I have a problem ;).As always I appreciated King's own words about the story - he wrote it in 1973 under the Bachman name and then put it away as it made him think of Oscar Wilde saying it was impossible to read 'The Old Curiosity Shop' without weeping copious tears of laughter (which he says is his own reaction to 'The Memory Keepers Daughter' among others).
This was one of the few King books that I hadn't read yet.
A new,unread King book is always a treat!
It took me some time to really get into it,and at times it felt a bit slow.
The character of Blaze was so well written,I really started to care for him.
I felt so bad for Blaze.
I love characters like that,kind of contradictory ones.
You care for them,feel for them,but they do bad things,things that are wrong.
Are bad things,like maybe killing someone for example,sometimes justified?
Blaze is now one of my favourite King characters.
Poor Blaze.
After reading this I am a little surprised that it doesn't have a higher rating.
I thought it was pretty damn good.Written around the same time he wrote Carrie, King listed this one under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman.
This is one of those stories that is told in such a way that you know the guy is a criminal, a killer, but knowing his past in detail, you can't help but feel sorry for the big lug.
There is another short story, 'Memory', attached at the end from which we get the novel 'Duma Key'.
This story was interesting as well.
I'm looking forward to that novel now.
Μετά το σκάλωμα που έφαγα με τη Μίζερι, ήθελα οπωσδήποτε να διαβάσω κάτι παρ' όμοιο. Να μπω 100% στην ψυχολογία του χαρακτήρα και να νιώσω την αγωνία του. Και το Μπλέιζ ήταν ακριβώς αυτό που ήθελα!Είναι από τα βιβλία που διαβάζονται με την ανάσα κρατημένη και σε βομβαρδίζουν με τα πιο έντονα συναισθήματα. Θεωρώ αδύνατο να μη συμπαθήσει κάποιος τον Μπλέιζ, παρά τις πράξεις του. Το τέλος με στενοχώρησε πάρα πολύ.
That is in no way saying that the book is bad, to the contrary, it was a very well-written and moving story that I thoroughly enjoyed.The thing that sets the tone of the Bachman entries apart from other works of King is that, while still very detailed and developed, his Bachman books tend to not stray as much from the main plot line into the extraneous details that are prevalent in so many of his other works.
These asides are part of what makes a Stephen King book stand apart as a Stephen King book.Blaze is a very fast paced read.
Although there is nothing I like better than to pick up a 1000 page novel by this extraordinary storyteller, sometimes less is better.
Irretrievably damaged with a dent in the middle of his forehead, he is removed from the home and plopped into the uninviting lap of the state orphanage.
After a particularly horrendous placing in a foster home, he is returned to the orphanage.
Surprisingly, Blaze grows up to be a gentle giant, eager to please and thus, easy to manipulate, a veritable tool in the hands of a smalltime con-artist, George.
Blaze's fate is sealed when he agrees to participate.
The novel was so-so. Honestly, the best part was the short story included at the end, Memory. It was the genesis for Duma Key, which I'm now really looking forward to reading. Otherwise, the novel itself only gets about 2 stars.
King tips his hat to Steinbeck in this one, it being a shadow of Of Mice and Men. Our narrator splits the story between Blaze's tragic childhood and adolescence, and his life in the present.
And, presently, our big galoot—dull-witted but big and burly—is carrying out a scheme of babynapping with his dead friend George.
...George?The story of Blaze's youth is what shines here.
The plot running parallel to the flashbacks, with Blaze trying to pull off the ransom without George, is weak by comparison, and quite predictable.
As he wrote the story, King learned that there was no way out for Blaze.
I liked this book even better this time around. It WAS sentimental, but in an honest way. Blaze had a heart of gold, but he was certainly no angel. I don't believe was written by Bachman. I know. Who am I to say, but Bachman's books are always depressing or bleak. This one was neither. It was sad, but that's not quite the same thing, is it?
Blaze ist dabei sicher kein Protagonist der dem Leser von Anfang an das Herz erweicht, doch lernt man ihn und seine Lebensgeschichte parallel zur eigentlichen Handlung immer mehr kennen und versteht dadurch auch immer besser seine Intentionen.
Ich war komplett gefangen in der Handlung und habe besonders bei den späteren Kapiteln bemerkt wie auch mein Lesetempo angezogen hat.
Zwischendurch drosselt King das Tempo zwar um sich Zeit für Blaze Vergangenheit zu nehmen, doch diese Verschnaufpausen dauern immer nur kurz an.An sich eine schnelle, aber auch traurige Geschichte, die durch ihren besonderen Protagonisten lebt und sehr deutlich zeigt, dass das Schicksal einen großen Einfluss auf das Leben haben kann.
The main character for me though principled is deeply flawed but you get to see where those flaws come from and even in the final scenes you realise how a misguided act actually has an underlaying purity after all what was Blaze screaming as he exploded from the cave?I know its all to easy for an author to play with the readers emotions - from making the reading invest themselves in the characters to playing with their sensibilities at the injustices they are put through - however here rather than rail against the world at the pain he suffered he just carried on and for me that makes the rest of the world (and the people in it) all the more cruel.This is not his best work by far but it shows to me how great a storyteller Stephen King is (in which ever guise) and that sometimes the simplest of stories can carry great power.
This was the only Bachman book I had not read by King, so I thought I would give it a shot.
Our characters are rather eccentric, and I think they were wrote this way on purpose, kind of like the good cop, bad cop routine.
You get a decent amount of backstory on Blaze, but next to nothing on George, which is ok since Blaze is our main character.I still would recommend this book to others who like King just because it is was the 'lost' Bachman book.
This is an ok book that I would not recommend as a first book you read by Stephen King.
However, I highly recommend it if you are a Stephen King fan, but need a break from his books with more complicated plots and multiple characters.
This one focuses on two characters (only one of whom is actually alive) and one simple plot, with some flashbacks.
"Blaze" is a brain-damaged man who plots to kidnap a baby for ransom, following the instructions of his former partner in crime, who is only alive in his head.
