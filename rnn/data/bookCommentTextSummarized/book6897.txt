Yet this short Christie mystery remains one of my favorites, likely due to the interesting characterization and well-crafted plot.
It's a very interesting household, and one of the great aspects of the story is how well Christie characterizes the eccentricities of its members--while they all are unlikely to have done it, any one of them could have.
One of my very favorite things about Agatha Christie is that when she said anyone could be a murderer under the right circumstances, she *meant* it.
This is why I think of Christie as absolutely ruthless in her fiction, however genteel she was in life...and Crooked House is Exhibit A!
It is a reference to one of the nursery rhymes that she employs to such creepy effect in many of her novels ("and they all lived together in a little crooked house").
The victim was a bit crooked in the legal sense, but had a good heart.
What an excellent story! I loved the characters, the family was amazingly twisted. Any of them could have committed the murder. I did not guess the actual murderer, didn't figure it out. I loved the writing, the dialogue. Christie was a master storyteller!Crooked House is the first Agatha Christie novel that I have read. It won't be the last.
En serio, jamás me cansaré de decir lo increíble que es esta mujer.
Adictiva y original como pocas.
No sé como le daba la cabeza para escribir tantas historias y tan complicadas siempre de adivinar.
La casa torcida nos presenta el asesinato de Arístides Leónides un anciano extremadamente rico que vive en una gran casa torcida junta a sus familiares.
En esta ocación ni Poirot ni Miss Marple.
Lo de siempre, muchos sospechosos, muchas hipótesis, y nunca das con la que es.
En esta ocasión logré descubrirlo, justo antes de que se confirmara.
Pero Agatha, prometo verte el plumero alguna vez.
Lo prometo jajaja.
En fin, maravillosa como siempre.
Our narrator, Charles Hayward, fell in love with Sophia Leonides during the war and intends to marry her if he returns safely to England.
However, his plans are thwarted when Sophia’s grandfather, Aristide Leonides, is poisoned and the family come under suspicion – with Sophia stating she will not marry him until the crime is solved.
Hayward senior is the perfect Assistant Commissioner, gruffly welcoming his son back from the war, accepting his declaration of love for a possible murder suspect and working out ‘who did it,’ but keeping that information close to his chest until the end of the book.
3.5 stars "Because this is just what a nightmare is.

If you like to read mystery's where all the members of a family are a suspect for a murder committed within the family , then this is your kind of book.The book starts off with Charlie and Sophie, Sophie's grandfather is murdered and Charlie's dad is the Chief of police.
Due to this I wasn't as surprised and it kind off spoiled the reading experience.Also, the ending felt a bit rushed and could have been a bit more detailed.
But this is still a good cozy mystery for a rainy day.
Crooked House is like reading a non-interactive version of those games as the narrator wanders from one boring character to another all of whom conveniently open up to him about their backstories, alibis, etc.
That said, I was interested enough to keep going and see whodunit and it’s as well-written as any of Christie’s best but generally it was a case of waiting for the pointless filler to get out of the way of the investigation’s resolution.I’d say this was a hopelessly generic country house murder mystery except Dame Aggie is largely responsible for defining the genre to begin with so I’ll just say Crooked House is one of her least entertaining/inspired efforts.
Your life is centered within a vast country manor dominated by your dread grandfather, who sits like a senescent spider in the center of his enormous web, a web whose tangles he created but no longer bothers to repair.
Then murder strikes and grandfather is no more!

Πέμπτο βιβλίο της Agatha που διαβάζω τον τελευταίο καιρό και πραγματικά ούτε στο ελάχιστο δεν πλησίασα τον δολοφόνο. Πιο εύκολο μου φαίνεται να αποκωδικοποιήσω τον δίσκο της Φαιστού, παρά να βρω τον ένοχο σε κάθε της βιβλίο. Διασκεδαστικό με όμορφη πλοκή και απρόσμενο φινάλε, η –Σοφίτα με τις αράχνες- θεωρώ πως είναι ένα από τα καλύτερα της βιβλία.Η αλήθεια είναι πως τη χαρά της ανάγνωσης μου τη χάλασε λίγο η άθλια κατάσταση του συγκεκριμένου (εποχής Βig Bang) αντιτύπου. Το βιβλίο μυρίζει έμπολα.Αυτά. Κατευθείαν για αντιτετανικό και εμβόλιο κατά της ευλογιάς.

4.5“Murder, you see, is an amateur crime.” Crooked House is Christie at her best.
No wonder it was her favourite, together with Ordeal by Innocence (on that one, I can't say I agree, though), of all her works.
Not a shred of a material clue, a jungle of psychological intricacies, a solution so unpredictable I had to read that part twice.
The reason this is not a full five for me is that I couldn't develop a real connection with the protagonist/narrator, a bit too bland, and with Sophia, the co-protagonist.
But the murder, the atmosphere, the plot—the rest is absolutely perfect.
Recommended.
I.e. it does not feature any of Christie's established sleuths (Marple, Poirot, Tommy & Tuppence, etc.).The story tells of a young couple, Charles and Sophia, who decide to postpone any decisions on getting married until after the war.
Everyone is a suspect and it is left to the couple to discover whom they can believe, or if they can at all.What is interesting with this story is the finding out who the murderer is almost takes a backseat to getting to know the characters of Sophia's relatives.
What an interesting bunch of eccentrics!
De estos libros que son una locura lo rápido que se leen (y eso que no es mi género favorito).Nos encontramos con una casa repleta de personajes que podrían ser el asesino o asesina por su personalidad (cada uno de ellos más sociópata que el otro) sin ningún problema, pero, sin motivos aparentes para serlo.
CHAN CHAN CHANSolo os diré que quedaban treinta páginas y hasta que no nos enteramos de quién es el/la culpable yo seguía sin tener ni la más mínima idea de quién era.
Reportedly, Crooked House was one of Agatha Christie's favorite books to write.
She held onto the idea for years waiting for a time she could write for her own personal enjoyment and thank God she did.
However, my favorite part of Crooked House was the characters, not the mystery.
Ms. Christie created a fascinating case study of a dysfunctional family where the crookedness might astound you.
Crooked House was a short but thoroughly engaging mystery, and I can't wait to see the new adaptation on the screen.
Check it out!My favorite quote:“Because this is just what a nightmare is.
Una vez más he vuelto a disfrutar con la genialidad de Agatha Chistie. El único motivo por el que no se lleva las cinco estrellas es porque descubrí la identidad del asesino, así que no hubo sorpresa final. Una novela torcida y retorcida. A por la siguiente.
¿Da buena suerte terminar un libro en esta fecha tan especial? ¿Es buena señal? 😂😂, reseña pronto acá.
Re-read Trust Agatha to challenge our preconceptions!
No Poirot or Marple, which I always find exciting since you don’t know where the story is going to take you.
It is perhaps one of her simpler plots but for the horrible resolution (view spoiler)[ to have the child as the murderer was a stroke of genius.
As we know today, it can happen but still shocks (hide spoiler)].
2015Great book.
I love Agatha and can always rely on her to entertain me.
This little book was just the ticket.
It is a simple story and yet brilliant.
لأول مرة أتمكن من تخمين هوية القاتل في منتصف رواية لأجاثا كريستيلكن أعترف أن الكاتبة كادت تحطم ثقتي في الحل الذي توصلت إليه قرب النهايةرواية شيقة، لها بعد اجتماعي مؤثر
Estrellas: 4,5Reseña completa:  http://anitavelabooks.blogspot.com.es...  La casa torcida  es una historia sencilla y enrevesada al mismo tiempo porque tiene una familia un tanto curiosa que te mantiene en vilo durante toda la novela. Y no hace falta decir que el final te deja con la boca abierta porque nada es lo que esperas y nada es lo que parece. A mí me he encantado y me ha animado a seguir leyendo más novelas de  Agatha Christie .  En el BLOG os cuento más. ¿Te pasas?
Agatha Christie levou-me a conhecer a "casa torta" através de um enredo soberbo difícil de igualar, e isso foi o ideal para me trazer de volta ao mundo imaginário da ficção literária.Este é o quarto livro da autora que tenho o prazer de ler e que se tornou um dos meus preferidos, a par de "As Dez Figuras Negras".
Charles é para além de detective, o narrador desta trama e guia turístico pela casa "torta", casa essa onde habita a família Leonides.A escrita de Agatha Christie é detalhada e muito cuidada, como já tive oportunidade de escrever em outras opiniões, proporcionando uma leitura fluída e quase sempre voraz.
There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile.He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile.He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,And they all lived together in a little crooked house.

قرأتها من وقت بعيد جدًا ، ربما عام 2005 ..كالعادة أغاثا تثير الشك ، في جميع إبطال الرواية كإحتمال أن يكونوا القلتة ..حتى ما أن تصل لنهاية ، لتجد أن الشخص الأقل ريبة هو القاتل !
Έτσι μας γλεντάει η Άγκαθα....
يبدو أن مشاهدة جميع أجزاء المحقق كونان آتت ثمارها 😁 ..لقد توقعت القاتل من نصف الرواية .. ولكن كعادة العبقرية اجاثا لن تعطيك الفرصة للشعور بالراحة والإعجاب بنفسك بأنك اكتشفت القاتل وإنما تبقى تحوم الشكوك حول رأسك حتى آخر صفحة بالرواية ..
Readathon 17: 11/26 βιβλιο σε ξενη γλωσσαΓυναικα συγγραφεας 7/14Δυστυχως ειχα υποψιαστει το δολοφονο απο τη μεση περιπου. Για μενα παραμενει νουμερο ενα το "then there were none", τουλαχιστον σε αυτα που εχω διαβασει ως τωρα.3,5 αστερακια
Ακόμα κι αν έχεις βρει το δολοφόνο πριν από τον ήρωα (εγώ δεν τον βρήκα, αλλά ξέρω ότι πολλοί δεινότεροι αναγνώστες αστυνομικών είχαν εξιχνιάσει το έγκλημα πριν αποκαλυφθεί ο ένοχος στο βιβλίο), αυτό δεν έχει καμία σημασία, γιατί η ανάγνωσή του είναι σε κάθε περίπτωση απολαυστική ακριβώς επειδή η Κρίστι έχει γράψει κάτι παραπάνω από ένα αστυνομικό βιβλίο.
Το συγκεκριμένο δεν με απογοήτευσε ως προς αυτό το σημείο και να ένα εξαιρετικό δείγμα:“Murder, you see, is an amateur crime...
They continue to be aware that murder is wrong, but they do not feel it.
That's what's so disturbing."Reading an Agatha Christie book is a little bit like coming home to me – a creepy (in this case, crooked) home, full of murder and deception, but still a home.
Her books are both familiar and completely new to me, introducing different characters and conflicts each time.I thoroughly enjoyed getting sucked into the crookedness of the eponymous crooked house and guessing the murderer alongside the detective (and boy, how wrong I was!).
If you're looking for an Agatha Christie that works perfectly well without one of her usual detectives, I definitely recommend this one!
Read this in one sitting. Couldn't put it down! Has quickly become one of my favorite Christie's. Loved the plot and twist at the very end, I can definitely see why this was one of Christie's own favorites. I also find it fascinating that the publishers wanted her to change the ending, but she refused. So glad she didn't. I don't think it would have been the same if it would have been changed.
I cannot say that it was one of my favorites but I did find the ending and identity of the murderer a surprise.Charles Hayward met and fell in love with Sophia Leonides in Egypt near the end of the war.
He promises to come to her when he returns to England and marry her.
When he does return and goes to her his marriage plans are disrupted.
She lives in home of her grandfather, Aristide Leonides, along with her extended family.
I was surprised when the identity of the murderer was revealed but that is the beauty of reading an Agatha Christie story.
