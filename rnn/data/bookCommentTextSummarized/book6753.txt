Balzac's writing style is high energy and informal -- one almost feels like she is in conversation with a young man who knows all the ins and outs of Paris living -- where Proust is plodding and formal.
Balzac provides a feel for the Parisian milieu he writes about, and even though he alludes to a great many things that only Parisians at that time would know first-hand, he is quick with explanations so there is no need to run for a reference book or endnotes to understand what or where he is talking about.
Had an absolute blast re-reading this one - a gift from friend Terri. Old Goriot is King Lear with the Faust myth thrown in along with some biting social commentary. Balzac's novel is peopled with social climbers, opportunists and frauds who exhibit Machiavellian ruthlessness. This novel isn't devoid of humor, however. Far from it! One particular character, the demonic Vautrin, who can right-size his victim via a Dennis Miller-like rant with laugh out loud results. All together a very entertaining read (thanks to Balzac I've been able to add some pretty witty putdowns to my repertoire).
The original Giving Tree. I've begun to wonder how these classics would read if rewritten in a simple modern American style.
Very interesting read. The characters are fascinating. Very memorable.
There is such a thing as giving too much.
One of my favorite books to date. Timeless. Describes youth to perfection
The prose is so beautiful at times that previous readers underlined and wrote quotes on the back cover.
