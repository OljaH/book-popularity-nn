(on that note, if you ever find yourself in Mobile, Alabama, I highly recommend stopping at Bienville Books, because it is lovely and you should support independent bookstores in any case)The stories included in this volume are all pretty good (okay, some are boring and not terribly suspenseful, but not many) and are by a wide variety of mystery writers.
Because oh my god, you guys, I would give my left foot to travel back in time and take a detective story class taught by Dorothy Sayers.
Miss Marple and Nancy Drew didn't exist when this book was published, so when Sayers writes, "But the really brilliant woman detective has yet to be created," you wonder what she would have thought of Miss Marple.
I read many of the stories but my favourites, the ones I reread many times, were those in the "horror" section, and it was this book that gave me a taste for horror stories.
After the books disappeared I sometimes wanted to read them again, but I could only remember the titles, and not the names of the authors, and I thought I would never find them again.
A web search engine quickly found the authors of both these stories, and "The Wendigo" was available in downloadable form.
Just great. Amazing journey. Edgar will take you on crazy, insane adventure with this book and you must be prepared, otherwise your mind will collapse.
(Hedley Barker's story)
A very good overview.
