The captain wants to breed the Black with his mare, but Alec can’t because the racing season isn't over yet.
Alec was worried because his stallion was in the same barn as his mare and didn't want the Black to get out of the stall and get to the mare.
Alec attacked the captain and the Black ran out into the Everglades toward the home of Kovi.
When Alec found the Black he got on him and went back to the area he had left the captain.
He went back to the captain’s house to tell Odin, another man at the captain’s house, to tell him the captain was dead.
This is the only book from the Black Stallion series that I kept; This one is a scary horror story, with a raging storm that traps them deep in the Everglade swamps with a sinister stranger. Then a ghost story about a swamp demon begins to come true... *shiver*
Loved this one especially
This book scared me as a 7-year-old.
"A god-horse, one no longer earthbound but of dancing fire, a winged Pegasus..."Another non-racing book in the Black Stallion universe, but not as interesting as the Black Stallion Revolts.
In the book the black stallions ghost this boy named Alec went ridding in the woods with his horse he saw.What he saw was a ghost like horse and a man ridding it. It was ghost and it changed him for ever.
The average reader of the Black Stallion series likes their stories to have all the questions clearly answered, have the horses be the most complex characters and have a definite ending--this book does not have those.
Also, he wrote The Black Stallion in 1945 and this was published in 1969--I think he EXPECTED his readers to grow up a bit and want to read something different.
This is one of the most unique books of the series, requiring you to think and use your imagination as well as to have a love for horses
Having got a bit bored by the Black Stallion series, I have to say that this one knocked my for six - completely different to any of the books that have gone before.
Enjoying a sense of freedom he has missed for a long time, Alec lets a ride get over long and they end up at the house of Captain de Pluminel, a horse trainer of exceptional skills whose white mare, The Ghost, is the envy of everyone.
Until The Black is threatened and escapes into the swamp.A slightly spooky story that I would have loved as a child, but I definitely never read it back then.
He was clearly insane by this point, it's the only explanation.Now, despite the harsh sound of that, I do want to point out that his daughter, Pam (remember this when you read The Black Stallion and the Girl), died in an accident while traveling with friends through Europe.
This was understandably devastating and likely contributed to Farley's increasingly erratic, strange writing, so while I do believe he was insane by this point, I also think he was deserving of sympathy at the same time.However, all of that does not make this book worth reading, so I advise you to skip it.
I have a number of this series' books--and some others by Farley.
Since it is set largely in the Florida Everglades and (even way back then) states dissent over the engineering devices which started to drain the Everglades, I have to admire it if only for that reason!
But, the plot gets sort of "other-worldly" and it's harder to appreciate this book over some of the others he has written.
It is hands-down more violent than many of them and incorporates Haitian legends, Seminole folklore, etc., but not in a positive way.
Too hard to explain the plot!
I have been horse crazy for as long as I can remember so books about horses are something I look forward to.
That said, The Black Stallion's Ghost was disappointing.The gray mare and her training is interesting.
From other reading I have done, she must be incredible to do the airs above ground as only some stallions are supposed to be strong enough.
I wonder if anyone has ever really done it.The book bogs down in the ghost story part.
But Farley should have done more research as the hammocks are not all built by Indians.The book is a fast read.
On a well deserved break before the start of the racing season, Alec and The Black find themselves once more embroiled in mystery and danger.
Deep in the heart of the Everglades, the pair stumble into a set of circumstances they don't fully understand.
Alec must save his horse, and himself...
there's no one else around to help them.Walter Farley, a true lover of horses, always jumps at the chance to introduce his readers to yet another equine discipline.
Yet Alec and The Black remain in the forefront, and that's what always makes for the best in this series.
I am always saying how Walter Farley's books are true adventures.
I am not a fan of this writing style for Farley, but I enjoy the concept of this book.
I wish that there had been a little bit more of an adventure to it than the talking that went on between two characters for a good half of the book.
There was also a lot of repetition that isn't typical of Farley's work.
It's enjoyable and in some ways is a mystery for the mind.
Alec thinks he knows what happened, but did it really happen in the way he thinks it did?
I really thought that The Island Stallion Races (remember?
ALIENS!) would be enough of a ramble into the world of the alien and supernatural for Farley, but he ventures there again in this completely pointless story.
Suffice to say, Alec spends most of the story running around the Everglades in the dark, pursued by some sort of supernatural being/god who scares another guy to death.
The book has virtually nothing to do with the Black; a race is thrown in at the end for no reason; the storyline of the series (what little is left, anyway) is not in any way furthered by this book.
The last few books in this series are really bad and what's really sad is that as much as I hated this one, there are worse books in the series.
Re-reading this childhood favorite has been a real love-hate relationship.
The books I remember liking the best, I still love.
I think the ones I didn't like, I hate even more.
In this book Alec and The Black get lost in the Everglades and spend the night with an old man determined to "steal" a mating for his mare with The Black.
The night is filled with terror and voodoo.
Really horrible book.
This was probably my favorite horse book that I had ever read growing up. It was also the first ghost story I'd ever read that really scared me, in part because it's such a departure from most of the other Black Stallion novels. I remember reading some of it out loud to my brothers (who also have a taste for the morbid) and getting a shiver out of them, too. I want to re-read it but I worry it will tarnish the memories of the nights I spent reading it originally.
I LOVED this book when I was a kind. Granted I was very much in love with creepy books such as Shadow in Hawthorn Bay and anything by Stephen King, so of all the Black Stallion books this one was right down my alley. I wish I still had a copy of it now because at the age of 33 I would probably still read this every few years. There was just something so deeply haunting about it that brought me back over and over again. I even still dream about it once every couple of years.
One day, the main character named Alec was riding in the Everglades with his horse, Black, stumpled upon a mysterious man and a beautiful gray mare. Alec then invited into the mans house, only to realize the host is on the verge of insanity. Alec and the Black are then being swarmed by demons through the deadly Everglades.
Since this is the first of the Black Stallion series I've read, I didn't really know what to expect. It was an alright story and I liked how the others told Alec that it was all due to hallucinations caused by the swamp. The ending was meh and I don't know if I'll pick up the other books from this series.
I was not a big fan of this book. It sort of felt like The Black Stallion meets some kind of Lovecraftian horror, and the end result was ultimately kind of boring. I didn't feel very invested in the story, and while it was not entirely obvious what was real and what was imagined, I found that I didn't really care. Kind of a letdown.
YUCK!!! I just wanted to yell at Alec "Go home!!!" It was such a weird book!! One of those books where Alec lives some experience and he falls asleep right before that so you think he is dreaming but he isn't, so it portrays the fact that there are ghosts and the like. There are several books in this series that are the same, and I did not like any of them!!!
The horses were beautiful, as always—but the whole tone of the story and the Haitian captain's beliefs were just too creepy for me. The only Black Stallion book I have read to date that I really dislike.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
I never realized just how much walter farley could take you into the supernatural world. It completely threw me off balance and I couldn't put the book down. He obviously did his research on the native american folklore for that area, of Florida. Definately a very good book.
Wow. This one may be even worse than the rabid bat one. Or the one with the alien horse race aficionados. Either way, it's near the very bottom of Farley's oat bag. Ludicrous plot. No Henry to speak of. Weird gods. Inexplicable characters who flicker in and out. Give it a miss.
I remember being terrified of this story when i read it in grade school. even though i read most of the others multiple times, i wouldn't reread this one. not scary really as an adult.
They probably could have done without this one. It really didn't contribute much to the series.
