All the characters, at one point, display interests that match Christie's own, and speak of anecdotes that parallel her own life - and none more so than Miss Marple.
There are the quite literal clues in the text that help us to solve the crime, and there are the more subtle ones that act as an insight into Christie's mind frame: she hints repeatedly of things "that would stare you in the face, if there weren't such a lot of red herrings to draw you off the trail."We are reminded that the "art of writing gives one an insight into human nature" and perhaps that's what makes this such a superior read.
Although these are short stories, there are links which make these more enjoyable than some collections of random stories.We begin with stories told at a group called, “The Tuesday Night Club,” in which Miss Marple, her nephew, Raymond West, artist, Joyce Lempriere, solicitor, Mr Petherick, Dr Pender, a clergyman and the retired Commission of Scotland Yard, Sir Henry Clithering, meet to discuss mysteries.
Interestingly, the village of St Mary Mead is mentioned in the Poirot novel, “The Mystery of the Blue Train,” and Miss Marple – although she did not appear as often in print as Christie’s Belgian detective, is almost as beloved and popular.
Miss Marple is the queen of whimsy, just as Dame Agatha Christie is the queen of crime.
Back ramrod straight, twinkling eyes, sometimes hands busy with knitting, there seems always something more to what meets the eye, with Jane Marple.There are some people who, when young, have an air of old people who have been airbrushed into false youth.
But there are other people, who, when old, you can imagine them how they must've looked when they were into their thirties.Miss Marple is a throwback to an early age.
The plot is mainly about people meeting at a social dinner and each person proposing a mystery.
But we must be satisfied with the dozen of Marple books or so.
a little, pink old lady sitting in the corner, trying to catch up on her knitting?For fans of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, the third image is as valid as the first two.This unlikely detective relies on her intimate knowledge of human nature, having had "the opportunity to observe it at close quarters" in a village like St. Mary Mead, to solve mysteries.
It is this predictability of human nature that the old lady draws upon to arrive at her conclusions.The Thirteen Problems contains two sets of six stories each in the same format.

فالمكان والحبكة وأسلوب القاتل متشابهان إلى حد ما وربما اعتمدتكريستي على قالب تلك القصة لبناء روايتها فيما بعد الغريب بقراءتي لهذا الكتاب هو معرفتي بحل الكثير من الجرائم الواردة ويعود ذلكلسببين لا ثالث لهما إما أن قراءاتي الكثيرة لكريستي اكسبتني بعضا من خبرة ماربل في كشف وتحليل 😎😄 النفس البشرية أو ربما أصبحت قادرة على تشغيل خلاياي الرمادية بسرعة كما بوارووالسبب الثاني والذي أرجحه بقوة 😂😂 هو قراءتي للمجموعة في بدايات دخولي♥️لعالم أجاثا ..
ومع ذلك استمتعت بقراءتها وبتنوع القصص
Each member tell one story of something they witnessed that had baffled them, and the other members of the party try to unravel the mystery.
Of course, every story reminds Miss Marple of something rather inane that happened in her quaint village of St. Mary's Mead, but that likeness helps her solve each case because "human nature is the same everywhere."Short story collections are not my favorite.
In a mystery, the ending always comes on rushed and underdeveloped.
And as two prominent dinner party attendees get their very own mystery in Miss Marple's next book, I'm glad I read this one first.
My favourite Miss Marple to date.
I've seen so many Miss Marple adaptations I'm glad I've finally made the decision to read the books. I've only read two of the books in the series now, but I can already say that you can never go wrong with the character. The Thirteen Problems (aka The Tuesday Club Murders) is a great sequel and I loved seeing more of our titular character. Plus, I couldn't resist all of the twists and turns and red herrings. My only issue: I wasn't all that interested in the rest of the cast of characters.
Miss Marple just happens to be one of those people and gets to demonstrate her uncanny knowledge of human nature repeatedly.I have to think that Charlaine Harris must have read this collection before she wrote her first Aurora Teagarden mystery story Real Murders which features the Real Murders Club.
Members of this club get together once a month to analyze famous murder cases.
(Harris takes things one step further when a member of the club is murdered.)This is a compact little volume—I read it in one sitting.
5 Stars2015 Popsugar Reading Challenge: A book with a number in the title.Que libro tan ingenioso, primero que leo de Agatha Christie.
Pero ese era definitivamente el encanto del libro, disfrutar de la detallada escritura, de alguna manera tratar de entender los misterios, sabiendo que probablemente no lo lograrás y sorprenderte al final con cada de uno de los desenlaces que aportaba Miss Marple.
5 StarsShort stories plus murder mystery it is a combo pack for me!!!One Tuesday evening a group gathers at Miss Marple’s house and the conversation turns to unsolved crimes. They decided to form a "Tuesday Night Club" where they share a crime and others try to solve it. This is the second book of Miss Marple series and I am already so so much impressed by her.She is very wise and knowledgeable. She is not a show off and very humble in nature.  "And I was nearly at my wit's end, I can tell you.
5 StarsShort stories plus murder mystery it is a combo pack for me!!!One Tuesday evening a group gathers at Miss Marple’s house and the conversation turns to unsolved crimes.
You have lived such a peaceful life and yet nothing seems to surprise you.""I always find one thing very like another in this world," said Miss Marple.
The cosmopolitan world seems a mild and peaceful place compared with St Mary Mead.""Well, my dear," said Miss Marple, "human nature is much the same everywhere, and, of course, one has opportunities of observing it at closer quarters in a village."
After plodding through one too many of her "random adventurer in exotic locale with vague political intrigue" novels, I found myself starting to feel a bit soured on my Year of Agatha and decided to return to a favorite, The Tuesday Club Murders.
Miss Marple is enchanting as always; she was a new character of Agatha's at the time, having figured in only one novel (Murder at the Vicarage) before this collection appeared in 1932.
Re-reading them, I remember why I love Dame Agatha and hold her in such high regard.
Another wonderful Marple book, this time 13 short stories (not that you'd guess from the title lol). As per usual Joan Hickson, sorry I mean Miss Marple, was at her absolute best. As with the majority of Agatha Christie books, I know I read this eons ago, but thankfully I only remembered a couple of the stories, so was able to play "guess the perpetrator" along with the collected ensemble at St Mary Mead. Very enjoyable again, now onto the next ha ha. What a fantastic challenge this is.
And to make things even more interesting, the storyteller won't (at first) reveal the murderer's identity.A book with 13 distinct puzzles penned by Agatha Christie?
I didn't even mind (much) when people were not even trying to guess the murderer in Miss Marple's stories.The only downside of it all, was the lack of whimsical humor, which was so enjoyable in the first book of the series.Score: 3/5 starsThere were a LOT of stories, and at one point things were starting to blur together.
Still, as an exercise in who-dunnit logic, it was a fun read.==============================================book 1: Murder at the Vicaragebook 3: The Body in the Library
I like Miss Marple, I really do.
She makes us yearn for tea, good company, good conversation, cozy quilted chairs and warm fires.
However, when Miss Marple is taken in concentrated doses ..rapidly told ..back to back?
Lets say, the tea becomes a bit sweet, the fire too warm and the conversation condescending.
Yes, Miss Marple, the old biddy that she is, is now lecturing us tirelessly about our inability to solve the obvious by assimilating the simple clues laid out before us, while sadly shaking her head.
And a once demure smile becomes a smirk.
أكاد أجزم إن القصص التي جمعت هنا كانت الكاتبة أجاثا دونت فكرتها كروؤس أقلام على أن تفرد لها رواية مستقلة كون فكرتها تستحق ذلك إلا إنها أعني أجاثا ولسبب ما قررت جمعها بهذا الشكل إما إنها كانت مجهدة ذهنيا أو لم تتوفر لها الحبكة المناسبة كان إيقاع الأحداث سريع كونها 13 قصة في رواية واحدة.. وكانت فارسة الأمسية الأنسة ماربل خارقة بشكل مبالغ فيه :)

It is a grand old time.
There is also a quasi-member of the club, an Angela Lansbury type, a dotty biddy from the old school.
Still, her archaic point of view is at times quaintly charming.
Does God give you extra points for being nice to the elderly?

Unlike Poirot's first appearance in full length novel, Miss Marple first appeared in short story -Tuesday Night Club published by the Royal Magazine in 1928.
Agatha went on to write six more short stories featuring Miss Marple before she wrote Murder at the Vicarage, Miss Marple's first debut in full length novel, published in 1930.
Christie later wrote six more short stories which were published in the Story teller Magazine in 1930.
All these thirteen stories give a vivid description of the life and times of Miss Jane Marple and St Mary Meads.
Personally I have always enjoyed reading Miss Marple's short stories than those of Poirot's.
Adoro a la Señora Marple. Me gustó mucho en Un Cadáver en la Biblioteca aunque su participación allí fue relativamente excasa. Aquí desarrolla todo su arsenal desenmascarando en su estilo a los culpables en las trece pequeñas historias que se presentan aquí. Bastante rebuscados (sólo acerté una y me considero a mi manera una experta) pero narrados con destreza.4,25/5
ثلاث عشر لغزًا في نادي الثلاثاء الليلي عن جرائم لَم يستطيعوا كشف حلها إلا بعد فترة .. مجموعة قصصية بطلتها القصة بجوار مس ماربل . مس باربل شخصية جيدة و وجودها يعطي للقصة أبعاد إجتماعية أكثر من البُعد البوليسي لكن القصص كالعادة كانت ذكية و ممتعة . حبكتها بسيطة لكنها محكمة و جيدة جدًا . أعتقد أنني أحب أن أصبح من أعضاء نادي الثلاثاء الليلي فقط لأري مس جين ماربل تحل الألغاز و تكشف الجرائم بينما تمسك بين أناملها المغزل و تحيك . * هناك ترجمة أخري للمجموعة باسم " معبد الحب " و يضم أحدي عشر قصة فقط .

Enjoyed a re-read.Very rarely do I really like short stories, but this coherent and character-establishing book of thirteen Miss Marple stories was an exception.
A set of six murder cases narrated at a meeting at Miss Marples', then six more at her friend Dolly Bantry's.
Only Miss Marple could solve these problems, although I did solve one!
Then the last story is of an actual murder in St Mary Mead, and Miss Marple is able to tell the retired commissioner of police who she thought did it, so ensuring that the local police investigate thoroughly.
You'll have to read the book!
The second Miss Marple book, and whilst not my favourite thus far, it is packed with fascinating mysteries and clever conclusions. The stories are collected under the guise of a 'Tuesday Night Club', in which six characters - including, of course, Miss Marple - get together to see if their minds are sharp enough to get to the bottom of assorted mysteries. The overarching structure works so well, and the individual stories are so clever that they could easily have been turned into longer novels. Undoubtedly clever, and eminently readable.
3.5 stars. I love Miss Marple but I definitely prefer the novels to short stories. They were all enjoyable but a bit forgettable. Except  The Blue Geranium  - that one I most definitely will not forget! Loved the ghost story vibe.
Αγαπημενη μις Μαρπλ!!!!!!!!!!!13 ιστοριες εγκληματος και μυστηριου, στις οποιες η τρομερη γιαγια διαπρεπει!!!!!!!!
I prefer novels to short stories, but these 13 short mysteries were fun to read on my break. Some were like riddles, that you can try to solve, some were a bit too farfetched for me. The best parts were Miss Marple's nuggets of wisdom, she's a really fantastic character.
Devine mai convingătoare pe măsură ce înaintează în poveste.Majoritatea povestirilor sunt discutate în acest club din care face parte și Miss Marple.
Și de fiecare dată Miss Marple ghicește, folosind «înțelepciunea omului simplu, cu detalii gen „nu faci colivă fără arpacaș”» (nu e cazul în povestiri, dau doar un exemplu).
Mi-ar plăcea să văd cum ar arăta un volum similar de enigme plasat undeva în România la țară.Poate un lucru deranjant este lipsa mizei (cu excepția ultimei povești, toate sunt repovestite) și faptul că soluțiile sunt uneori aiuritoare - poate sunt lucruri pierdute în traducere (deși nu cred) sau poate pur și simplu sunt povestiri trase de păr (mult mai probabil).
Agatha Christie's compilation of Miss Marple stories, The Thirteen Problems, was published in 1932.
It marks the second appearance in book form of Christie's beloved spinster sleuth, Miss Jane Marple, whose debut in The Murder at the Vicarage had occurred only two years earlier.
Miss Marple is my favorite Christie character.
Unfortunately I did find the Miss Marple of The Thirteen Problems to be somewhat problematic.
I prefer a busier Miss Marple, one who is out and about, quietly insinuating herself into the lives of her neighbors in St. Mary Mead.
The mysteries of Agatha Christie were the first "grown-up" books I read.
