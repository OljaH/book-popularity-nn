It makes so much better sense now.Whatever a person might think about Southern magical practices, it's still the most highly recommended book on this form of candle ritual.
No wonder; the author, for whatever his personal reasons, seems to have taken however much time for research to quickly touch on such background as known anthropology and informal interviews, and even has gone so far as to site different scriptures for support, even though, according to Gamache, the old world practices had to be modified for use for the modern America of the time.
Practical hoodoo for candle magic. Great for more advanced candle magic practitioners. To be used as a reference guide.
