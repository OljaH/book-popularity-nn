No date yet.SERIOUSLY!!!???!!!???!!!Its bloody pissing off how much the storyline of this series is being stretched when its not even fucking needed.Sex scenes are like fillers in this series, they take up 90% of the story :P One more book?
My reaction is more of being pissed than happy that we are getting a 4th book.•The first book really nice; like kinda FSoG but still really nice.•The second book was so fucking stretched; it was not even needed...
YAYIE CANNOT FUCKING WAIT• and maybe a bloody book 5 too.
5 STARS!!This is the fourth book in this series and continues Gideon and Eva's story than began in Bared To You. In order to prevent spoilers, I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just my feelings about this book so you're perfectly safe to read this review even if you haven't yet read the book.
Almost a year and a half since book 3 we are getting more Gideon, drama Eva, drama, sex, unnecessary drama and their merry band of family, exes, friends and enemies.
Enemies and exes are coming vengeful out of nowhere and I feel that Gideon and Eve are fighting just on principle.
But as someone in love with the heroes I feel that I have the right to care for what is happening to them.I LOVE YOU GIDEON CROSSPlease keep reading for my pre-release rant...2 more books in the Crossfire Series....Hold on a bloody minute....2????
*This is just a matter of opinion guys.*I like this series, I do.
But was it just me or was being in Gideon's POV just feel a tad off?
I don't know, I just felt disconnected with him.Also...
while you do see Ava and Gideon making progress in regards to their relationship, there was no substantial anything that occurred in this book.
It just felt flat and redundant throughout.*sighs* Sorry, I may be being a tad hard on this read but I didn't feel it matched up to the hype it had been given.Strangely enough, I DO plan on reading bk5 though when it comes out.

Step 1: Write a trilogy and announce at the end of the book that there'll be more books to come!Step 2: Make your readers wait for 1 and a half year for the next book to be out.Step 3: Releases said book to only find out later that it's filled with nonsensical bored out of my freakin mind filler plot.Step 4: Charges $8 for said book.Step 5: Ends the book by saying the next one is coming soon.
But to sum this book up for me, basically this is what I honestly think SD felt when she wrote this book.SD: Oh dear, my readers love Gideon & Eva so much, I can't let this trilogy end yet.
Whatever the reasons, this book didn't hold the appeal for me that the earlier books in the series did.Gideon and Eva are back on...then off...then on again.
There was nothing appealing about his voice in this audiobook.Despite this book's short-comings, I will probably continue this series at some point.
However, after reading four books, I feel too invested in this series to hang it up now.
Much like I can't DNF a book, I have this compulsive need to finish a series if I've read past the first book or two.
I too will not be reading this as OMG what a total farce to keep dragging this out for financial gain.
Let's face it book 3 was so full of repetitive crap that it shouldn't have been a book 3 in it's own right but should have been part of book 2 and half of book 2 should have been book 1.
So come on Sylvia Day give us some credance to having brains, we are not your money train and show us some respect as what your doing with now having 5 books is leaving us with very little respect for you.
WHYYYYYYYYY WHAT WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????(were 4th and 5th really necessary O_O?????)well,more Gideon fo
5 *CAPTIVATED* starsIt's been a while and I almost forgot how much I enjoy Sylvia Day's effortless writing!
The story, the writing, the pace, the flow of events, everything ...
I planned on skimming through book 3 because I didn't remember much but, as I started reading 'Captivated by You', it all came back.
Very emotional and super sexy à la Sylvia, this is my favorite book in this series so far but the stage has been set for so many events that I bet grand finale would be just that - grand!If you are a fan of the series, I think you'll really enjoy this installment.Cheers!
♥ Epic Buddy Read with my lovelies JASMINE, SUPREET and FLO ♥ ** 1 "#NotEvenGideonCanSaveThis" STAR ** When an author decides to stretch her world-famous series into 5 books and makes her fans wait for it FOR 17 MONTHS, you can’t help but think ”Whoooo! Something epic must be coming, yeah?”Well, something epic did come my friends. Because this right here, is an EPIC FAILURE.I’m not gonna say ”I’m so disappointed with this book.” or something, because I had no hopes for it to be any good anyway.
After the disastrous Entwined with You re-read and seeing even some of my more optimistic friends not exactly loving this book, I was damn near sure I’d hate it, so I’m not surprised at all.I’m sorry but I won’t even try to sugarcoat it: Sylvia Day totally screwed us over.
I couldn’t even give a rats ass about Anne, Corinne, Christopher Jr, oh or even Ireland —who was actually kinda sweet!!I really don't care or even like half these people!So please…PLEASE stop trying to drag Gideon & Eva’s story on with all this crap.B. The extreme amount of sex I had to endure
Just don't know if I'm gonna read this one or not. For me, this series has lost a lot of its momentum with the release dates being so drawn out. Originally I thought it would be a trilogy and the story got dragged out over several more releases and it's kind of lost it's sparkle.I have to add that I did love the first couple of books and may well need to restart the series to fully enjoy this one. It feels like years go by and we don't have a new Crossfire book!
Is there such a thing as getting enough of Gideon Cross I mean really. I can read 10 books about them and still be tempted to read the 11th.I can't wait for the 4th and 5th books to come out. Sylvia Day is a amazingly talented writer and I am sure what ever comes in the 4th and 5th books will be just as good as the rest.Can't wait!!!!!!
4 Solid Stars Captivated by You wasn't as "captivating" for me as the first three books in the series were, but I still very much enjoyed reading it.
Amazing, considering this is the fourth book in a romance series about 
one couple.
As other reviewers have mentioned, this book does have a bit of a "filler" vibe, but not enough that it hinder my overall enjoyment of the story.
Captivated by You is a well written and provocative addition to the Crossfire series.
I'm glad I trusted Sylvia Day's talent as an author to continue to give me a couple worth rooting for.
The author feels like there's more to the story (or just doesn't want to end the success of the series) so there will be more.
I'm having a hard time letting go of the characters I love so I'm happy that there are going to be more books.
It doesn't pull it's punches just because it's a fictional story and the happy ending is going to cost the characters a lot of pain and hard times.
I believe that it'll all right itself in the end but I enjoy reading it so far and I can't wait for the next one.
4 stars!   I would set the world on fire to clear a path for her, if thats what it took.   The fourth installment of the Crossfire series wasn’t perfect, but it was still an entertaining and enjoyable read for me. It had it’s ups (ANYTHING with Gideon. Elevator. Sex swing. Cary) Then some downs (The bickering, and there were some little things towards the end that rubbed me the wrong way). I listened to the audio version of this book and I thought the narrators were awesome. They did a great job
Cary) Then some downs (The bickering, and there were some little things towards the end that rubbed me the wrong way).
If you asked me to sum up my feelings for Mr. Cross, I would have to take a line right out of the book to do it.
My favorite line of the book came from him, cause lets face it...
I, however am happy that we got one solid book (that wasn’t the final book) with them married and working through their issues.
I’m hoping this means the next book will have far less bickering and they will be on more solid ground.

Sylvia Day could write 10 more books about Gideon and I would still read them.Ah, we had to wait for this part for almost a year and a half....
I say, hell yeah, keep dragging Sylvia Day because I will never have enough of Gideon.
And they have a lot to be worried about, there are people from their pasts lingering, trying to hurt them, to break them apart, there is their broken past, there is Gideon's family drama and his inability to open up, there is Eva's insecurity, her family and friends' problems and so much more...
I get why Eva would have second thoughts about their relationship, why Gideon's obsessive love would sometimes scare her, scare that she might lose herself along the way.
3 Hot Stars.  Okay, in this fourth book the story of Eva and Gideon continues… and well, as f*cked up as ever. I won’t tell you exactly what happen not only because it is too much on too little time. But as they try to go on with their married life (while trying to keep it a secret), the media, their past and their family don’t give them a rest, and they need to find out they keep together when hits to separate them are coming from every direction. I have a love/hate relationship with this seri
3 Hot Stars.
Okay, in this fourth book the story of Eva and Gideon continues… and well, as f*cked up as ever.
I love Gideon, but the story is dragging so much is making me losing my interest… even in him.
Waiting 17 months for a book in a series isn’t good either… there’s a lot I don’t remember and I didn’t want to lose time going back to re-read.
Or Sylvia delivers an epic ending in the next book, or not even Gideon is going to be able to save this.

;D********************************************Posted after reading:MY REVIEW:If you know me...it was fairly predictable how I would react to Captivated by you, but honestly I was hoping and even praying a little that a gazillion years between publishing the last book and this one would help Ms. Day to find some actual plot.
4 - 4.5 Mr. Dark and Dangerous StarsMy love for Gideon goes way back, he basically had me from this moment:  “Because I want to fuck you, Eva. I need to know what’s standing in my way, if anything.”  I remember reading that line and thinking SHIT JUST GOT REAL. I have loved Gideon since and I anxiously await every release in this series. This particular release I hunted down the paperback book just to read it a few days early…FAIL. A lot of people would classify this book as filler and honestly
This particular release I hunted down the paperback book just to read it a few days early…FAIL.
Gideon and Eva are married, but as all married people know the ring and vows are not majestical things that fix your problems.
Truthfully, I respect the fact that Day isn’t just magically fixing their problems.
We read so many books that are drama, drama, drama and then the epilogue they are magically fixed - no drama, perfect couple.
I can’t wait to see what happens next for Gideon and Eva. If you are a fan of the series, I highly recommend reading this one.
*****3.5 STARS*****{BR with Mel, Dee, Sharon, and Tiffany} I can't believe it took me five days to finish this book!It felt like an eternity since I had read "Entwined With You". I was upset that Sylvia Day decided to make this a 5 book series, but not enough to give up on it. I was dying to get my hands on this book. I'm so very sad that this book just didn't win me over. I found it to be kind of slow for the most part. I didn't like the unnecessary drama with Brett, Corinne, and the other two
I pretty much disliked Eva the entire time I was reading this book.I am only rating Gideon a FIVE!!I loved him and his passion & devotion for Eva. He would do anything to make her happy and to keep her safe.
I think she needs a dose of her own medicine.So even though I was bored to tears throughout the book, the fact that I do love Gideon and the sexy time scenes were extremely panty melting, I couldn't see rating the book below 3.5 stars.What I hope for the last book is that we don't have anymore of the unnecessary drama from ex lovers.
1.5 Procrastination Killer stars Okay, it takes A LOT for me to give a book anything less than 3 stars. Seriously, go to my profile and look at my stats. It's a rare thing for me. I was literally choosing to write papers for graduate school over reading this book. I finished a damn 20+ page paper in 2 days because I was avoiding reading this book.My biggest issue with the book? I was bored. That's right, BORED!  Gideon and Eva were boring! I still kind of can't wrap my mind around this. After t
I was literally choosing to write papers for graduate school over reading this book.
I finished a damn 20+ page paper in 2 days because I was avoiding reading this book.My biggest issue with the book?
I was bored.
That's right, BORED!
Gideon and Eva were boring!
But nothing happened in this book.
Honestly the only real plot development was (view spoiler)[ Gideon's stepfather finding out about the abuse, the job issue and Cary telling Trey about the baby.
THAT'S IT IN 350+ PAGES  (hide spoiler)].
So needless to say I am off Team 5 Books.
Will I read the next book?
Two steps forward; three steps back(Spoilers only if you haven't read the first 3 Books)Captivated by You is the perfect springboard for a finale, but didn't quite deliver the punch expected from the Crossfire series...
Scenes like that were reminiscent of the classic 'Fortune Cookie' scene from book one and reminded me why I love this series.As I said before, it's fair to say that I hold Sylvia Day to a different standard.
I have decided to stop reading this series.
It was originally ADVERTISED as a trilogy but after the success of the first 2 books the author became greedy and decided to release a 4th and 5th book.
I am so disgusted and disappointed by this author.
She is clearly taking this opportunity to make a quick buck and thinks nothing of the fans that are responsible for her success.
For now I will no longer read ANY books by this author.
Maybe when I've calmed down that will change but for now all I can say is, "SHAME on YOU, Sylvia Day!"
They will be forever in my book heart.It’s been quite some time since the last Crossfire episode but fear not reader, if you're a lover of Gideon and Eva you’ll easily remember plot points with Sylvia Day's well placed reminders about previous events and characters.
Indeed, all the supporting characters add to the mix perfectly.Eva is his everything.Gideon is her all.
I love getting the point of view from both Gideon and Eva. His voice is delectable his words....
Eva's heart pours into her descriptions and thoughts providing us with such a clear picture of Gideon and her love for him.
Start to Finish, I could not get enough of what Sylvia Day was laying down.I have followed the tumultuous relationship of Eva Trammell and Gideon Cross from inception in Bared to You until now and I could not be happier.
But for me, this book was more about the relationship of Gideon and Eva. We all know is was fast and furious full of fight and F***!
What I love the most though is that he is a man in hard LOVE.I have no shame in saying Gideon is quite possibly my all time Favorite "damaged male." My love for this book lies in the deeper emotions I finally got from this man.
“You okay, angel mine?”“I’m in your arms. Life doesn’t get better than this.”  It will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me as a reader that the Crossfire series is my own personal kryptonite. No other series has kept me as emotionally invested for such a long time as these books have, having re-read each one of them countless times and always discovering new layers to the story, new details that I might have missed or skimmed over on that first…or tenth…or twentieth re-read. This is one
This is one of the most powerful, passionate love stories that I know of, Gideon and Eva being two such meticulously developed characters that we cannot help but want to talk about them over and over again, psychoanalysing their every action, their every word, their every breath, because they feel that real to us.
As we finally hear Gideon’s voice in this book, we get to see firsthand the depth of his love for Eva and how her presence in his life has changed him.
The packing peanuts in this book are the sex scenes, and try as you may to search through all of them, but you aren’t going to find a caramel, maybe a piece of butterscotch candy.
It would be interesting to see Eva going to California without Gideon trailing, as it would to read about Eva going to lunch without Gideon waiting a table close-by, it would have been interesting to read any scene without them together, because as we all find out, they can’t be together without engaging in sex.
The name of this book should have been: Entwined with You Version 2.0, or Gideon Fucks Eva Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again.
Sure I wanted the book sooner – but having to wait wasn’t going to stop me from reading the story.
I want to know all of those pieces and getting two books gives me a chance to discover them all.Now for this installment, it is short in timeframe and we get a few clues as to Gideon’s past – still no clear answers or resolution, but we did get a glimpse into the man himself.
