I haven't actually read this, but I've seen the musical so I'm going to count it as read.
This is the musical being performed by our high school this year. I was chosen as one of the couple violins to play in the pit. The story is wonderful, albeit the end is quite cheesy, but it makes me smile. The songs are cute and pretty, and the jokes are great.
Summer musical 1987. Done outdoors. Very cool. I was a townsperson & in special ensembles. VERY FUN!
12/11 refused to watch (VHS a possible reason)
Lovely and catchy music! I would love to see the play now!
I read the play, listened to the Broadway production, and watching the movie with Gene Kelly. I actually love this story. It is fun and light.
Lovely. A bit of a time capsule itself, very 1940s
