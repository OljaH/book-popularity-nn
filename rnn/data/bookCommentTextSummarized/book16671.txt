I just have one thing to say;
This is my fourth or fifth time through the series, and I just love it more every time.Having read through a few reviews on Goodreads, I know that this series, and the character of Tohru especially, gets a lot of flak for being too cutesy.
In fact, I think that she's an incredibly strong character, because she tries so hard and does her best to be happy no matter what life throws her way.Also criticized is the zodiac curse.
Their curse is being stuck together.What really makes me love this story so much though is the way that it grows and changes.
I hadn't read manga before this one, and I only picked this up based on some of my friends' reviews with no expectations.
The graphics were just too cute!<3 And for me, the plot was very refreshing and unique because I hadn't come across anything like this until now so I really enjoyed it.
-If you still aren't convinced to read it, here's another reason: it has naked men too.
However, the only reason for giving it 3 stars is that I kind of struggled with this one, and I can't blame the book because it was me who wasn't familiar with the genre, so there's that.
I never read this as a kid and I definitely haven't watched the anime, but I heard that this was really good from a lot of people.
It genuinely felt like I'd just skipped to the fifth book of a series because I had no idea what was supposed to be happening.I almost DNF'ed this, and finishing it just secured its status as something that totally isn't my taste.
I'll definitely be trying more manga from the library in the future until I figure out what my taste is in the genre, because this is only the third one i've read.
2nd book read for BTAT2017 "read a book entirely outdoors"!This manga has an enjoyable enough storyline and characters, but the art style really doesn't work for me. I might read a couple more volumes to give it a chance, but I may just watch the anime instead.
I LOVE this series. It's really cute! This was one of the first manga series I've read. I own a few of them. As always, I won't add all of the books to my self. Way too many.
The entire plot seem very messy and half of the time I had trouble understanding what was actually meant to be going on.
There was no character development and the scenes jumped around continuously, so it was difficult to figure out where the story was going.I actually felt like I jumped into the middle of a series,it was THAT confusing.
But now, if I'm honest, I don't think I'm going to bother continuing with this series as there is a lot more manga out there to be discovered!
[This review only covers volumes 1-12] It was last year when I realized that I am so done with shoujo manga stories (especially in a school setting). It wasn't as if it was a constant presence in my life growing up or anything, but after a while I realized that its formulaic sweetness and often predictable climactic moments just doesn't appeal to me anymore. In fact, there are only three shoujo manga stories I was really into and two of them were adapted to anime which I preferred (Ouran Kouko
Hey, I told you I don't like this genre anymore, so the fact that I'm singing praises for a manga that is beholden to said grating genre should say something!~+~+~+~+*+~+~+~+~THE CHARACTERS~+~+~+~+*+~+~+~+~In the course of the series, Tohru Honda gets introduced to each new relative from the Souma clan, all the while there are three core male characters she interacts with on a daily basis after she moved in with them.
is a splendid shoujo manga series that almost breaks the formula every now and then, starring a beautiful and relatable ensemble cast you will easily love, and tackles real-life issues in an earnest way that doesn't pander to the readers, or diminish said issues' seriousness by belittling their message.RECOMMENDED: 8/10DO READ MY REVIEWS AT
Initial thoughts:1. I felt so nostalgic reading this manga again!2. Toru is such an adorable, although naive, character. Love her!3. Shigure and also Hanajima and Uotani are hilarious!4. The fights between Yuki and Kyo seem to never end.5. Amazing artwork!Check out my full review on my blog!
Total impulse read! 4.5 I really just felt like continuing this story! I watched the anime about 5 years ago now, and the ending is still bothering me, and I just need to know what is going to happen next! Cute, funny, typical rom com anime/manga. However, I hear it gets darker, which should be interesting.
I'm not throwing in the towel yet, but I spent the first quarter of the book just trying to figure out how to read the dern thing.
I'm certainly not an expert, so I think I need to research this more thoroughly...with more books.
Since this series comes highly recommended by an awesome friend, I'm going to keep going with it for now!
Any other graphic novel recommendations?
I'm interested in checking out this genre a bit more, actually.
For now, I'm giving it a two star rating, but that's probably more to do with my confusion and figuring-it-out-as-I-go more than the book.
I'd rate this a PG.
After a classmate of hers, Yuki Sohma, discovers that Tohru is living in a tent, he offers to let her lodge at his house with his slightly perveted uncle Shigure and cranky cousin Kyo. It is not long until Tohru discovers that the Sohma family have a secret, that they are cursed by the zodiac, and transform into one of the zodiac animals when intimately touched by someone of the opposite sex.
Whilst none of the darker content is explored during this volume, we start to already glimpse the effect Tohru's optimistic and happy personality is having on the issolated Yuki and Kyo. Going back to the beginning of this story was as fun as my first time reading this as a thirteen year old.
🐭 Next volume is Yuki!
Rereading this old favorite. I love it so much!
¿POR QUÉ NADIE ME HABLÓ DE ESTE MANGA?
And the rest of the characters are sitting by either calling her a fool or being amazed at how she can be SO STRONG and happy, even when she's gone through so many horrible things.Okay.So pretend you were holding some super delicious ice cream.
Even in the first volume, you learn a thing or two.Most of my friends are guys and they don't really like Fruits Basket because they assume it's a girly girly manga, but it makes me want to slap a hand across their faces because THEY CAN LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM THIS BOOK!!!It touches your soul, okay?Put your hand on your heart and close your eyes, okay?
It's about a cloyingly sweet, kind, selfless, gentle, beautiful high school girl named Tohru Honda.
Sweet, innocent Tohru is wrought with guilt because she's sure it's her fault her mother died, because—are you ready for this?—she forgot to tell her to keep safe.
She somehow moves in with her glamorous, sexy classmate, "Prince" Yuki Sohma, and his glamorous, sexy brother, both of whom fall head-over-heels for her.
Apparently, all of the Sohmas are cursed with the signs of the zodiac, meaning they turn into their animal when hugged by a member of the opposite sex.
They approve of Tohru living with the Sohmas.
5/5 Stars.This was a reread for me and it was just as good as the first time I read it! I love this story so much, it melts my heart.A great introduction to manga in my opinion.
Yes, she's a huge Mary Sue. Anyway, Tohru finds out that her tent is on Sohma grounds… The Sohma's are of course a bunch of hot, mysterious, attractive guys that live together and share a not so sexy secret… And guess what?
Even though Tohru and the Sohma guys (Kyo and Yuki) were stereotypes, I still loved their characters.
I loved Kyo and Tohru's interactions — they were really cute.Fruits Basket was a funny, light and entertaining read - I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to dip their toes in manga.
I now understand what it means to deal with these messed-up feelings, to remain good for others, and to stay true to yourself and your life-affirmed values.'Fruits Basket'; my favourite manga and anime of all time, finally gets a review.I will try to keep this as brief as possible, since the series is so complex and so full of rich, living, three-dimensional characters that one could fill a whole Chinese transcript describing them and all the intricacies of this 23-volume series and how they come together towards the conclusion.I'll start by saying that it is a gross oversimplification to describe 'Fruits Basket' as a slice-of-life drama about an orphan girl and a bunch of family members who turn into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac when held by the opposite sex.
One of my absolute favorite series... So good to reread it! This gets a 4.5 rating from me now. 5 stars for the nostalgia; 4 stars really for a good beginning, but it comes across as ditzier and more comedic in the early volumes, whereas I think it gets even better later on when things become more serious. On to volume 2!
I started reading manga a couple of years back and this series was on my radar since then.
I decided to pick this up on a whim, on a slow day, when I couldn’t decide what to read.
One day, on her way to school, she meets Shigure Sohma and becomes friendly with him.
The introductory scenes of the main characters and their progression through the volume was quite interesting.
I couldn’t pick a favorite character in this volume, I liked them all equally.
I couldn’t wait to get into the next volume so I picked it up… and finished it too.

**Review for the entire series**This is the first manga series I ever read.
I spotted the first book randomly in a small bookshop on Balboa Island, a charming little place that I can never get enough of.
Looking at the book description now, you probably think it's a little ridiculous.
It may seem like there are way too many books in the series for you to ever finish it.
It may seem like you wouldn't ever understand the backwards to forwards way of reading manga books.
The F Twins gave this one 5 stars!My little sister gave it 5 stars too!Noran dropped another 5 star on it also!Why I don’t like it then!!!?
This don’t make sense!!!
like Tohru at the beginning living in her tent… in the woods!
That’s totally K.I. Hope!!!
She is all sad… because she lives in the woods!
Then there are the side “random blah blah blah” that sounds just like Sam “Black Velvet”* I swear!
That’s totally Karen!
And yet I don’t like it!
this makes no sense!!!
I hope it gets better!
One of my friends introduced me to the world of manga, and this story in particular.
As far as mangas go (and stories in general), this one just does it for me.
I never feel as much while reading as I do with these!
It makes me cry and laugh and I honestly feel better while/after reading these.
It's a great thing, being able to find characters that are strong enough to lead you through their stories.
And if my sloppy review still has left you not knowing whether you want to give it a try or not, I think you're interested for a reason, and I doubt you'd be disappointed.
Update: Here's my full review! http://www.bookishrealmreviews.com/20...This was so freaking cute! I absolutely loved how the Chinese Zodiac has been incorporated into the main storyline. It was a light read and easy to get through. I think what was most interesting was the manner in which the Sohma boys all have different personalities based on their Zodiac affiliation. Tohru is amazingly cute. She's just a bundle of sweetness and I think she's going to end up being a really good fit for the family. I cannot wait to pick up volume 2 which is already on reserve at the library.
Re-reading these because it's a fun shojo that proGRESSIVELY TURNS INTO A GRITTY, MEAN PSYCHOLOGICAL DRAMaaaaaaa. *cough*But damn the drawings in the first book are so 90s and Tohru is desperately dumb.
Rating based on entire series.I'm so sad it's over! I never wanted it to end! RTC
The best shoujo manga ever!Saya punya anime nya di laptop komplit dua puluh enam episode.
Suka sekali dengan theme song pembuka dan penutupnya.Honda tohru, seorang yatim piatu yang terpaksa harus mandiri setelah ditinggal ibunya wafat dan kediaman kakeknya direnovasi sehingga tohru disuruh menginap di rumah teman.
Aneh memang, tapi tohru yang naif polos dan lugu menurut saya wajar.
Gak ada yang dilebih lebihkan.
Haha, sindrom tertarik pada orang buangan kali yah?Masing masing tokoh punya masalah yang kompleks yang bisa saja menimpa diri kita.
Seperti tagline di theme song opening nya :kita tidak bisa dilahirkan kembalitapi kita bisa merubahnya.
