Pure magic. I am convinced that this book was one of the very early, formative events of my life. No kidding. Thanks, Mom, for keeping me surrounded by Little Golden Books!
Dumbo written by Helen Aberson My big sister used to call me Dumbo because my little ears stuck straight out!
(I was just as ornery with my retort calling her Purina Dog Chow.)My dad would soothe my hurt feelings by first reading Dumbo, then the Ugly Duckling.
Poor little Dumbo couldn't help how different his ears were - he was still precious and beautiful to his mommy and daddy.
And just like the Ugly Ducking, someday you'll grow up into a beautiful swan." My goodness...
read these little classics with your children and talk about what the stories really say!
I must admit that this book kinda scared me when I was younger. I don't remember exactly why, but it did.. I should read it again, because it has probably been more then 10 years.
Dumbo is about an elephant that is made fun of because he has very big ears. This teaching young students about accepting each other as you are.
This is so sad, I love it, Dumbo is one of my childhood favorite stories
Chlo√´ got this as a Christmas present, and I read it to her and Claudia when they were supposed to be settling down for bed. They listened to it, but it did not settle them down for any longer than the time it took to read though - too wound up, might miss something... (Sorry to anyone who actually wanted a review of the book, but this is what mattered to me about the experience.)
When I was a child long,long ago this was one of my favourite stories. My children and grandchildren loved this book as much as me. The movie is magical especially through a child's eyes. Highly recommended for children big or small.
I always enjoyed this movie and book.
A great book to teach children the importance of acceptance of character instead of appearance.
When a circus elephant is born with large ears, he is given the name Dumbo. After being taunted by kids at a show, his mother was so angry that she got locked up. Dumbo causes accidents that injure other circus animals and is dress up like a clown and has to perform dangerous stunts. Dumbo soon learns his enormous ears allow him to fly and he decides to show everyone at the circus his new talent.

I remember reading this as a kid and being so upset about Dumbo. It reminds me of my childhood when I read it.
It remains a classic ... a wonderful story.

You don't even need to go much beyond the copyright page to be charmed. A little mouse, leading a floppy eared elephant, is hilarious. And the red hat was darling. I could just imagine, "The acrobats, the jugglers, the tumblers, the snake charmers, scramble to their places on the train." This is another gem in childen's literature.
