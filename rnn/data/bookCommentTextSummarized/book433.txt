Kafka has a very interesting writing style; Love it!
Ich möchte die Person sehen/hören, die das in doppelter Lesegeschwindigkeit ohne Fehler und Pausen vorliest, ohne zu explodieren.
To then fill in the gaps with some vivid images - a tubercular lady circus-rider galloping round the ring for months and months without interruption, applause which dies down and rises up again, hands which clap like steam hammers - will do quite nicely.And then a long second sentence begins with a rebuttal of the first one - 'Since things are not like that' - and a common writing 'shape' is stretched-out and attention is drawn to it (as a film director sometimes suddenly shows the cameras working on the set), and some of us are very pleased that Up In The Gallery exists.
Um, whut??? This reminds me of the type of dreams I usually have, random and bizarre.
Another Surreal short story. Performers or artists beleaguered unto sickness by the demands of their audience. Much like his "Hunger Artist".
