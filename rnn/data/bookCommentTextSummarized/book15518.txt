Because you're a bitch in heat who wants to scratch the itch of sexual frustration and stop the loneliness, OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE NUMBER 2!WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!And in case you're wondering, she didn't end up with any guy because -ha!- she deserves it.P.S: There's nothing more annoying than a heroine whose heart started beating wildly just because a good looking guy looks at her.
Dr. Maura Isles returns home from Paris feeling jetlagged and irritated after a medical conference.
Because the victim of the shooting in front of her home looks exactly like her.As a medical examiner, Dr. Isles instinctively wants answers.
The police are involved – Detective Jane Rizzoli lends a hand, even though it is not her jurisdiction.
Most of the information comes from a detective in the Newton Police Department, Rick Ballard.
There was even less of Detective Rizzoli in this one than there was in The Sinner, and that was a bit disappointing.
Maura’s pursuit of her past leads to some startling and stunning revelations, investigated by an eight-months pregnant Jane Rizzoli who didn’t let that slow her down one bit.
There are also two other situations in play that seem to be disconnected from Maura’s circumstances but deep down I knew they would eventually intersect.
This is my most favorite in the series to date and I’ve enjoyed all of them.
I’m so enjoying these stories, even though they are nerve wracking at times...just the way I like it.
I love thrillers, but I hate the type where every page is a blood bath, and the author focuses more on grossing out the reader than on trying to create a good story.
That's why I am so happy to have discovered Tess Gerritsen.
The author does a great job of making everyone accessible, while not giving TOO much backstory and boring the reader.
Her past catches up to her when a woman who could be her double is found shot outside her apartment.
Isley must discover who this woman was, who killed her, and why she's next on the list.
When a murdered woman turns out to be Dr. Maura Isles’s twin sister that she never knew about, Maura starts searching for answers about her biological parents. The more she learns, the more she wonders if some things are better left not knowing. This was a thoroughly captivating read with some genuinely chilling moments. Disturbing and a bit twisted, as well. It kept surprising me throughout.

My favorite of the series so far
Richtig Richtig gut!!!Spannend und trotzdem mit genug Tiefe auch wenn immer etwas passiert und es kein bisschen langatmig oder gar langweilig wird. Tolle Charaktere und ein für mich spannender Twist am Ende den ich nicht erwartet hätte! Super Rizzoli&Isles Fall - Ich lese ganz sicher weiter 5 Bücher hab ich ja noch mit den Beiden :)
Kesinlikle serinin en iyi kitaplarından biriydi..O kadar akıcıydı ki...Akşam elime aldım ve 3-4 saat sonra kitap bitmişti.Tess,sen nasıl bir kadınsın ya??!?
Gerçekten,Anna'nın katilini öğrendiğimde ağzım bir karış açık kaldı.Aklımın ucundan bile geçmemişti.Ama sonra yazarın aslında bir sürü yerde ipucu verdiğini farkettim.Tüm o ipuçlarına rağmen farkedememişim.Ve kurgu gerçekten mükemmel ötesiydi.Gerilim hiç bitmedi kitapta.Hatta bazı yerleri nefesimi tutarak okudum.Karakterlere gelirsek,Tess'in kitaplarında yarattığı güçlü kadın karakterlere BAYILIYORUM.Keşke tüm yazarlar ezik,erkeğe muhtaç kadın karakterler yerine Rizzoli gibi güçlü,kickass hatunlar oluştursa kitaplarında.Rizzoli'ye gerçekten hayranım.Şuana kadar kitaplarda gördüğüm en güçlü,en cesur karakter.Sırf bu yüzden bile serinin tüm kitaplarını okuyabilirim.Ve birde Maura var.Kendisine hala tam anlamıyla ısınabilmiş değilim.Hatta üçüncü kitapta resmen gıcık olmuştum kadına.Maura'nın kendisine bakan,hatta süzen her yakışıklı adamdan etkilenmesi,hoşlanması gerçekten beni yer yer gıcık etti.Ama kitapta ilerledikçe onun bu hareketleri anlam kazanmaya başladı.Ama tabii ki benim favorim Jane Rizzoli.Yazarın da onun üstünde durmasını istiyorum tabii daha çok.Ama yine de bu kitap gerçekten çok,çok güzeldi.Çıraktan sonra serinin en iyi kitabıydı gerçekten.Keşke okuduğumu unutup tekrar okuyabilsem.Polisiye/gerilim sevenler bu kitabı mutlaka okumalı.
I just finished this book this afternoon and I utterly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.
It was the first crime novel that I've read in a long time where I was wrong about who the killer was (I normally guess the killer correctly before I'm halfway through the book).
I'm looking forward to reading some more of Tess's books in the future :)PS: I also watch the TV show and I'm glad the TV version of Maura has a 'nicer' birth family!
Paddy Doyle ain't so bad compared to Maura's birth parents in this book!
The 4th book in the Medical thrillers by Tess Gerritsen.I love this series the plots and the characters are carefully sculptured making an excellent read.
Boston medical examiner, Dr Maura Isles, was relaxing for a few days in Paris after a conference before heading home, and back to work.
She quickly exited the cab, and made her way down toward the crowd of police, to be greeting by shocked looks, looks of total confusion from her colleagues!Detective Jane Rizzoli, who was very pregnant, was standing in the middle of what was obviously a crime scene, and when she noticed Maura, she looked dazed, like she was in a trance, as she looked from the vehicle in front of her, to Maura....
Maura and Jane are thrust into a crime so horrendous, so horrifying, it's hard to comprehend.
Love all the books with Dr. Maura Isles and Det Jane Rizzoli
Dit boek heeft me wel wat slaap gekost, maar dat komt omdat het zo spannend is.
Vanmorgen kon ik ook niet langer wachten, maar moest het uit.
Ondanks dat ik zo weg moet.
Ik vind dit boek het beste van de serie tot nu toe.
Het boek is spannend en interessant en het verhaal zit goed in elkaar.
In dit boek is Jane ook niet zo bezig met bijvoorbeeld de man-vrouwverhoudingen en andere issues.
Daardoor komt ze veel sympathieker over.
Al deze dingen maakt dat ik dit boek vier dikke sterren geef.
Hopelijk is deel 5 ook zo goed of zelfs nog beter.
Wauw wat een boek! Moeilijk om aan de kant te leggen.
Dr. Maura Isles comes home to Boston from a medical conference in Paris to discover police investigating a murder just outside her home.
And the victim is her exact double.DNA tests reveal the murder victim is, in fact, her twin sister, though the doctor, an adoptee, wasn’t aware she had any siblings.
Subsequent investigation discloses she and her twin were sold to a baby broker lawyer by a psychotic woman serving a life term for a double homicide.
Could that woman be their mother?The story proceeds with more twists and turns than a country road to unravel a complicated plot full of surprises and with a nail-biting conclusion.
Num dia como outro qualquer Maura Isles depara-se com um aparato policial à sua porta e descobre o cadáver de uma mulher... igual a si! Um teste de ADN comprova que esta mulher é sua irmã gémea. O seu choque não podia ser maior!Maura que sempre soube ser adoptada, pensava no entanto ser filha única e esta descoberta vai levá-la a querer conhecer o seu passado, mas estará ela preparada para trazer à luz segredos tão macabros??Mais um livro de Tess de que gostei muito! Venha o próximo :)
Bir seyleri tahmin ettim sanarak senin zekani kucumsedigim icin ozur dilerim Tess Gerritsen. Boyle bir olay yok. Cok iyi, cok!
Fiquei um pouco triste porque queria ter acompanhado mais da sua vida pessoal e de como esta a lidar com todos os desafios que descobri nos livros anteriores.Achei muito interessante como as coisas foram emergindo.
E o mais cativante de tudo é descobrir a forma engenhosa como, a partir de um crime, se desenlaça uma teia de situações que me deixaram rendida à mestria e inteligência da autora para tecer uma história assim.A cada livro que leio da série, reforço o meu gosto por ela.
Com este meu gosto crescente, tenho uma enorme vontade de conhecer mais livros.
For full review - The Limit of Books Does Not ExistEach book in this series keeps getting better and better!
Body Double is the 4th novel in the Rizzoli & Isles series (you may recognise the name from the TV show).
I love the relationship between pathologist, Maura and detective, Jane.
There is much more of Maura in this novel than Jane, which I enjoyed because I felt that the first two books in the series were more focused on Jane.I will have to check out the TV series soon, since I am loving the book series!
Another good book in the Rizzoli and Isles series. I liked getting more background on Maura's life, although if I were her it would definitely be unsettling. Weaving past history and past murders to the current murder was an interesting plot and a good read.My only complaint is I would have definitely liked more in the epilogue. Unfortunately in series like this there seldom is that thorough of epilogue with all the players in the plot.
Tai dar vienas be proto įtraukiantis detektyvas. Kurį skaitant, puslapiai vertėsi nepastebimai.. 🤓😍 Kaip visada Tess meistriškai įsuka skaitytoją į nenuspėjamų įvykių verpetą, negali atsitraukti tol, kol neužverti paskutinio knygos puslapio. Man labai patiko ši knyga, kaip ir kitos, kuriose dalyvauja Ricoli ir Ailz. Kam norisi intriguojančio ir įtaigaus detektyvo, siūlau net nedvejojant perskaityti šią istoriją. 5/5 ⭐️
Glorious murder fest in a great series. Any plot mention would give something away but Isles finds out about the dark history of her family, Rizzoli works some gruesome murders whilst eight months pregnant and the body count is high. Brilliant twists here and there and a high speed thrill fest from start to end. Darned good stuff.
Being a fan of the hit TNT television show, Rizzoli & Isles, I felt drawn to the books that inspired the characters.
Tess Gerritsen vividly brings Boston homicide detective, Jane Rizzoli, and medical examiner, Dr. Maura Isles, to life in the pages of this book.
This is not the first book in the series, but one doesn't need to have read the prior novels to understand what's occurring in the plot.
In fact, there are times when the reader wonders if she’s reading about the same characters that inhabit the television series.
Overall, the basis for Tamaro’s television characters can be found in the writing of author, Tess Gerritsen.
Tess Gerritsen has done it again!
A thriller that is high on suspense, tension and plot and low on the confronting gore that thwarts so many of the books in this genre.
Dr. Maura Isles arrives home from an overseas conference to discover police investigating a murder just outside her home.
The victim is her exact double and turns out to be the identical twin sister Maura never knew she had.
Why was her sister murdered?
Was Maura the intended target instead of her sister?
How did her sister find her?
You just can't go wrong with Tess Gerritsen.
I enjoyed this book much more than the other Tess Gerritsen book I read, Vanished.
Unfortunately, I don't think this was the next one in sequence like I thought it was.
She made references to things that happened in other books that I haven't read yet so that kind of ruined it.
I can't read The Surgeon now becuase this book gave away the ending.
I didn't know what to think about Ballard until the end.
The ending caught me by surprise, it all finished up in the last 10 pages.
I was late for work becuase I had to finish reading it before I left.
Another great audio book about Rizzoli and Dr. Isles.
This time it was focused on Dr. Isles and her life.
Someone is murdered outside her house who is identical to Dr. Isles.
This starts a path that Maura starts to wonder if she should have gone down.
There are lots of twits and turns and second guesses on who did it.
It has a shocker to the end.
There are some creepy characters and some characters you grow to like.
I find while listening to this series I tend to arrive at my destination not knowing how I got there.
I just read The Likeness by Tana French and now I'm reading this. In both, the story is about a dead woman who looks exactly like the main character who now has to investigate the murder. Strange. LATER ... the stories are totally different.This was a solid investigative thriller, with some surprises. A quality read.
This book picks up the thrilling pace of the first two. Whilst learning more about her history, Isles becomes the main character of the book and rightly so. The story is punchy and unexpected. Fantastic read.
Gerritsen tackles the 'nature versus nurture' debate in this next book in the Rizzoli and Isles series. A great thriller, filled with familial bonding and questions about one's upbringing with or without parents.
