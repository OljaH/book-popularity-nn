Well, it is, but this novel really sets up the whole Necroscope series, so the Whampyri theme isn‚Äôt quite as predominant (yet) as some might have hoped.
It has that Eighties thing going, to be sure, just look at the Bob Eggleton cover (which, by the way, is pretty awesome, in my opinion), but it‚Äôs really, really good if you give it a chance.
It‚Äôs not a splatterpunk an overly gory novel, which means that a lot of the tension and horror is psychological.
4.0 to 4.5 stars. I just finished re-reading this book and had forgotten just how much fun it was. Harry Keogh is an absolutely fantastic character and his powers (i.e., the powers of the Necroscope) are original and very cool. This is a book that I have not heard come up very often in discussions of really great series and I think that is a shame. This is extremely well written and very engaging. Highly recommended. Most recently read: August 10, 2009.
Brian Lumley addresses that problem in Necroscope, where Harry Keogh saves the world from monsters and Communism.
This ability comes in handy when Harry is enlisted by British Intelligence's ESP branch to fight a KGB vampire named Boris Dragosani.
This plot sounds ridiculous and you're probably wondering if Brian Lumley is a slightly retarded twelve year old, but this book is awesome, largely because the writing is so good.
It's British and fun and is more intellectually satisfying than a book with a vampire skull on the cover should be.
I have been trying to read it for 10 days and barely made it to 35% of a less than 400 page book.
And then 100 pages of boring, followed by about 20 pages of Bond villain level melodramatic Evil with a capital E.
Like 100 pages of school stuff, including teacher conferences about the kid, and WTF-I-THOUGHT-THIS-WAS-A-VAMPIRE-NOVEL, math homework problems.
I would like those hours of my life back, please.(PS, sorry for the awkward pics and fat fingers...
There are MORE WHOLE BOOKS, presumably just like this.
I will say that there were cool drawings in the book...
Looking back I suppose it was getting set up at the time, but it didn't feel like it.Then we got to Harry, and I was much more interested.
And then it sort of reversed, and Dragosani's story became more interesting, and Harry, after skipping a few years, sort of became stunted.
I mean, I don't mind things being a bit slow or thin plotwise if we're getting some juicy character stuff, but after the initial set-up and self-discovery of the two's individual powers, it just seemed rather repetitive.I kept waiting for something to happen...
I truly loved reading this one.
Really got into the plot and characters; barely did anything else for most of 2 days.
This is an another author new to me that I'm going to have to explore, and deeply.
Why if I had next book in the series in hand, I'd be reading it immediately!
Complete page-turner.
The beginning was a bit cool and drowsy but once the leading man was introduced, about 100 pages in, the books plotting got pacey and thrilling.
Harry Keogh is a fascinating character.
Can't wait to get my hands on a copy of books 2 and 3!
There‚Äôs a lot going on in this one. It is much more than the standard blood sucker tale that I thought it was going to be. Brian Lumley pens a unique take on the vampire mythos and adds some very cool paranormal esponiage elements as well. His characterizations were very well drawn and while the pacing is slow at times, it never disengaged me from the storyline. It had a real ‚Äúold school horror‚Äù feeling throughout. Excellent. 4+ Stars.
Harry is an outcast child trying to fit in at school, blessed with the powers of speaking to the dead.
Telepathically the evil vampire Ferenczy communicates with him, bringing him closer with knowledge as the web.It‚Äôs a serious book with little joy, but the evil Ferenczy managed to amuse me, especially when teasing Dragosani about his lack of experience.
I can‚Äôt help but like the putrid character ‚Äì he‚Äôs diseased in soul and mean as a snake, but he‚Äôs entertaining to read about.Unfortunately the book finds itself spending a ridiculous amount of time in the heads of other characters too ‚Äì characters in political positions that I care absolutely nothing about.
Politics bore me like nothing else does.

(Yes, I was a middle and high school girl reading horror novels about vampires in the 80's.) So, one day Brad asks me, "Have you ever read Brian Lumley?" and I'm drawn irresistibly back to the series.First off, they are dated.
The Russians are EVIL, the Americans are...well, not quite saints...but the good guys nonetheless.
I still love Harry Keogh today as much as I did in the 80's and 90's.Fourth, a great plot is timeless.
It's fascinating to think about the great masters and what they would do with infinite time.So, I guess it's obvious that I love this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes Horror.
First few chapters are slow. Very slow. But then the book picks up and just keeps getting better. What I'd believed to be a vampire/horror novel revealed itself to be much more. Necroscope is a Cold War spy novel, where world powers use ESP-gifted agents to spy, interrogate, and assassinate. There is a vampire. It's a beautifully grotesque re-imagining of the monster, more Lovecraft than Stoker.
That‚Äôs not to say the whole book is written in that blood stained vein, Lumley knows that a little bit of gore goes a long way, but he also knows that the audience for a book called ‚ÄòNecroscope‚Äô doesn‚Äôt want him to skimp on it.There‚Äôs also a lot of sex, which actually gave me something of a nostalgic glow.
But if you were looking for a good British horror novel of the 80s ‚Äì with all that sub genre‚Äôs interest in gore, sex, flawed heroes and drizzle ‚Äì then ‚ÄòNecroscope‚Äô would be a definite top recommendation.
A story with a character that can talk to the dead, one that can extract the dead's secrets, one that can give the "evil eye", a vampire, zombies, British and Russian secret agencies that employ agents with all sorts of ESP talents, and a sci-fi space/time continuum all set in the middle of the Cold War. How can Lumley pack so much goodness in 500 pages?
Harry is a teenager in Great Britain who is learning to use his newfound ability, talking to the dead, and we get to watch the young necroscope learn and grow through the first two-thirds of the book.
Wow, okay, it took me a little longer than usual to get through this book.
The amount of detail was a real slog at the beginning, but once you start getting into it, the story really takes off.
As for the story, it was not what I originally believed it would be about, yeah, there are vampires, but not in a great abundance, but that's okay.
Enjoyed this entry very much and am looking forward to starting book 2.
Lumley's vampires have most of the same powers and weaknesses as traditional vampires, but (view spoiler)[ they are an actual, parasitic creature that exists in the human body.
(hide spoiler)] Things get a little far out by the end, as it turns more into a superhero battling a supervillain rather than a necroscope battling a vampire.
(hide spoiler)]Overall, I did enjoy it.
If you are looking for a traditional horror story, you'll probably be disappointed.
If you enjoy horror, spy tales, and superhero stories, then you should like this one.
I will however, read at least the next few to see where the story goes.
The first 1.5 hours or so of the audio recording were a bit long-winded and made me worry that I'd been duped into reading a book solely about political espionage (or in this case, E.S.P.ionage).
However, once that bit was over the story really unfolded and took off in a couple of different and more interesting directions.
As for the level of gross and gory, the most graphic scene took place within the first hour or so, just to give the reader the picture of Dragosani's unique "gift." The novel was very intelligently written; it wasn't just a gore-fest with no substance.
I really should have loved this book, set in the years after WII with the traditional Cold War adversaries and an added supernatural twist, competing divisions made up of agents with unusual abilities.
This is a series of books so I guess you can consider this a set-up book but it just seemed like there could have been a better way to incorporate all the information without resorting to these extended segments of info dumps.
So even with my unhappiness with parts of the book I will still check out the next book in the series.
Very cool story that ended up being more mature than I had expected. It starts out with a bang, kind of meanders around for a while in the middle but the last hundred pages brings everything together with a decent amount of action and bloodshed. Totally not a typical vampire story this book really scores high in originality.
This book runs the gamut of genres: Horror, Espionage, Supernatural, Sci-Fi, Mystery, Thriller, etc. I instantly fell in love with Brian Lumley's creations. In fact, I'm currently in the process of re-reading the Necroscope Series for the 2nd time and loving it all over again. Lumley is the Horror King üëø
Lumley‚Äôs Tarra Khash series (a.k.a. Tales of Primal Land) was written in a similar vein (i.e. fun Sword & Sorcery adventure in a Weird-Fiction, Cthulhu-esque world).2) Blood Omen Legacy of Kain: A huge fan of the Horror S&S Game Series ‚ÄúBlood Omen: Legacy of Kain‚Äù, I was delighted to learn that Lumely‚Äôs writing influenced Denis Dyack‚Äôs vision of Nosgoth.
Given the Visceral, Vampire, Lovecraftian, and Time Travel elements, this makes sense; however, the book has a contemporary setting versus the medieval one in the game.As a fan of Khash, Heroes of Dreams, and Legacy of Kain‚Ä¶ I just had to check out Necroscope.
He wants you to know the ins and outs of every character in his story because, the moment the drama begins, that's when things get complicated.
Despire the fact that his two central heroes, Dragosani and Keogh, hold these formidable powers, their characters and backgrounds are well established and written out which makes you truly believe that these two men are really human and could really exist.The story itself is completely original - not what it would seem at first, so keep reading.
This is the first book in a long series - a series I will definitely be pursuing in time to come because the story isn't over yet.
Absolutely brilliant and fresh, written in a unique style, the first book in the epic horror series is definitely worth the cash and worth every second of reading.
The vampires Lumley created are aliens, pure evil, just the way a horror genre fan would expect.
Of course there were moments when I just laughed or basically wanted to put away the book (and I did - now I regret doing so as I would have finished reading it faster).
Oddly enough, I do not consider it a pure horror book.
The three star rating is basically due to the fact that it feels really dated because of the cold war aspects to the story.
Harry works for a secret branch of the U.S. government that is trying to infiltrate and discover what they suspect is going on with their Russian counter-parts in the KGB.
The problem is that the bulk of the story relies on the cold war angle, which anyone born after the year 1992 isn't going to connect with.
If you can put aside the dated feel, then by all means give it a whirl.
Oh, and he channels the dead.But Harry is not the only necroscope in town, er, the world.
Soon both of them use the dead to gain new skills; eventually, Harry learns to teleport and Boris learns to kill with only a glance.Curious to me, every single psychic in ‚ÄúNecroscope‚Äù is male.
Having been involved with a parapsychological research group, I've found the majority of talented psychics to be female.As I said, years earlier I read Lumley's Titus Crow series and other books which are derived from themes and characters out of Lovecraft's mythos.
He is in communion with Thibor Ferenczy, an ancient vampire who has been buried in Romania, bound with chains of silver for centuries and is bargaining with Boris for his freedom.The novel is set against a Cold War background where the British and the Russians both have secret ESPer departments - staffed with telepaths, precognitionists and the like - who are battling for information.The fates of Harry and Boris are intertwined leading to an inevitable confrontation.
The other main point I would like to make about this novel is that it raises the question of what constitutes 'a good book'.
I was looking at the shelves I have marked this book with and I realized that I should probably add much more since this book was such a mixture of genres.We have vampires but a totally uniques story with the simbiozis between the host and the parasitic vampire, we have dead rising at the end of the book - or better said zombies, we have scientific talk about time relativity and different dimensions, time travel etc.
That was really something...Dragosani was a really evil character and I'm not going to miss him lol (hide spoiler)]I plan to read the second book in the series and see where it takes us.
I wasn't caring about the characters and what they were going through.
Things were plodding along nicely from that point and then something happened and I just lost interest.
I think it was the fact that the characters were paper thin and I had gone past caring about what was going on and the constant back story of everything.I scored it higher as it had some good ideas to it and wasn't bad enough to stop me reading it to the end but I won't be getting the next in the series.

I was blown away by the originality of this novel. Commandingly written with a unique and compelling take on the vampire legend and the use of paranormal abilities in the Cold War. His deft hand has combined horror, sci-fi and espionage into a unputdownable whole. Brian Lumley is master storyteller who is gifted with an uncanny ability for mining nuggets of fear from a readers soul.Loved it.
It's a trend I notice with Lumley's writing for me is that it takes me forever to get into his books. I find them boring up to a point where it gets really good, and then it enthralls me.
