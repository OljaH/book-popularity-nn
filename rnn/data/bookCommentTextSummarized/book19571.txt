It’s a hodgepodge of Bram Stoker, Tom Clancy, Stephen King, and John Steinbeck: one if by vampires, two if by military games, three if by bloodbath, and four if by brotherly melodrama.Overall I liked it.
the world, like they did later in the book?) so they could extract the GOOD part of vampirism (you know, extended life, superhuman strength, and damn near indestructibility) without the bad part (bad skin, bad breath, restricted diet, No Exit signs in the Mortality Room, etc.).
Suddenly a viral attack develops more than two possible results (death and the equivalent of taxes – being a vampire for life).
While the book has compelling moments, too often Cronin starts to develop a character but never really completes the task.
Just why Cronin thought having most of his characters use this one expletive (flyers) baffled me, but I also started to wince every time someone used it.
The first third of the book is quite good—the plot moves forward, and characters are developed.Then, you reach Part III, which begins with a long military report that sucks out whatever momentum the book had attained.
You promised me such wonderful things with your sparkly cover, your titillating title (a passage to WHERE??), and your massive hype.
I still don't know what the passage was, but it was full of vampire-things and massive doses of character backstory that also didn't really *mean* anything...
I believe next I'll tie a ransom note to you and throw you through a window, just for the giggles.You had such lovely backstory, such vivid characters in your opening quarter, I couldn't put you down.
Characters that I didn't care about, in a situation that seemed so distant and unreal compared to your sharply defined predecessors that I thought perhaps I was reading a different book.
Pretty cool!! 😊💕
Government projects gone wrong, post-apocalyptic struggles for survival, battles between good and evil, strong people, weak people, and lots and lots of vampires.That said, I felt that there were almost two complete, independent books within the whole.
Even with the been-there-read-that aspect of the book, there was something about the writing of that 246 pages that kept me turning the pages, thirsty for more.
If The Passage had kept up the frantic and so-engaging pace of its long opening, it would indeed have been one of THE BOOKS TO READ this summer.
Otherwise, I resented the time it took to read this waaaaaay too long book.
when i read horror, i'm usually looking for: (1) cheap thrills or (2) surreal and metaphysical weirdness or, best of all, (3)  an epic full of dread and melancholy . there is plenty of the first sort and so much of it is trash. but fun can be had with trashy things and i'm no snob. the second type can be a little more hard to find, but there's a lot to be had as well, if you look in the right places, especially the past. but the third kind, that's the hardest, i've only found a few. Declare, It,
in a lot of horror, i'm not exactly eager to slowly lose myself in the world depicted - the experience is often more like a rollercoaster or a fun nightmare.
it is an excellent novel, complete with multi-leveled characters, spiritual mysteries, exciting action set pieces, and the trappings of several genres (vampire, post-apocalypse, and in the first third, an on-the-run-from-the-government-style thriller).
i just really was not expecting that and it was wonderful to experience.unlike many other readers, i felt the remaining two-thirds were very strong, moving easily between a wide range of physical and emotional landscapes, from complex world-building to pointed irony to moments of eerie beauty to straight-up horror (particularly in the Haven sequence).
very, very Epic!I feel like I just read about 5 books.
I mean, I can believe it because there is more story to tell, but how much more epic can this get!?4.5 out of 5 starsThis one lost a little for me in the middle due to a blah transition that caused me to lose interest for a period of time.
So, if you are reading this review before you read the book, know that you should not give up if you get bored in the middle .
this too shall pass!In addition to being epic, this was great story telling.
And I stay away from really big books, usually, because I don't want to get to the end feeling dissatisfied.
This big book left me feeling just that.
The first 250 pages of this book were brilliant—left me wanting more—Initially.
But, the rest of the 766 pages?
By page 650, I wanted this way-too-long story to be over.
I wanted to be taken off of life support and die.
But in the end, this book was like a firecracker I was so anxious to light up, and once lit and backed away to see the display take place, ended up being a dud.
This is Wolf Blitzer from CNN’s The Situation Room, the program that tries to make viewers think that you’re seeing the busy hub of television journalism instead of admitting that despite our high-tech looking set and satellite feeds, you’d probably learn more about what’s actually going on in the world by looking out your window.We turn our focus now to growing rumors that the U.S. Army is conducting secret medical experiments on American soil.
Major, thanks for joining us.Major John Smith: Thanks for having me.Wolf Blitzer: So I’m sure you’re aware of these persistent stories circulating, Major.MJS: *laughs* Yes, they’re keeping my office quite busy.WB: And the Army’s position is that they’re absolutely unfounded?MJS: Of course.
Cronin combines two classic and overused literary elements--vampires and the end of the world--and spins them into something entirely fresh and new. To me, it's an amazing accomplishment.
Now, the Huge Post-Apocalyptic Epics are a thing of the past - most novels concerned with life after the Big Bad are much slimmer, and adressed to young adults.
We still remember reading The Stand years ago and hoped for at least a glimpse of that feeling.The trouble is that this is the 21st century - the author would be hard pressed to come up with new ideas instead of relying on all familiar plot devices and developments...and well, he doesn't.
The author likes backstories - instead of letting these characters act and come to life, he dumps pages after pages of their past on the poor reader's conscience - care damnit!
This book got me to the important realization that zombies are just vampires gone retarded.
The characters I cared about were no longer at the forefront of the story, the aspects that kept my attention were replaced with a much less intriguing set of circumstances, and I had to seriously consider whether or not I wanted to continue.That's not to say that the last half of this book turned out to be dreadful.
While there's no denying Cronin has the ability to write deeply engaging characters & spin a distinctive tale out of a trope we've seen many times before, I'm not sure I can fully trust him to keep the focus of the story relevant across two more books equally as massive as this one is.
I haven’t read any of Justin Cronin’s books.
Of course, the interviewer was asking Cronin if he read Twilight (he hadn’t.) Is Twilight REALLY the be-all, end-all of vampire books?
When I first picked up this book, I considered not reading it because it was 766 pages and that seemed way too long.
However, I read the first sentence and got sucked in: Before she became the Girl from Nowhere -- the One Who Walked In, the First and Last and Only, who lived a thousand years, she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy. Amy Harper Bellafonte.
I love reading these post-apocalyptic books because there’s such a sense of hope.
All three books (Kindle edition) in the trilogy (The Passage #1, The Twelve # 2 and City of Mirrors #3) are currently on offer: 0.99p in the UK and $0.99 (I think) in the US. No idea how long for. I bought the first two novels, awhile back, when they were on offer; and now, I've finally got the third book, uber cheap. Hope they're good. I might get around to reading them, someday. I hope.
By the end I give it a hearty 3* but just can't bring myself to offer 4.So, this is a vampire book without the sparkling, the forever sexy trope, or the stalker-horror vibe.Cronin's writing reminded me a lot of Stephen King, though with a more literary edge (which is not to say that King doesn't have a literary edge ...
And if it had been half the length with the focus on half the characters I would have been much more taken with it.As it was it was a great relief when things started to go tits up and the roll call began to diminish rapidly.The third and final section is the quest, and here I found myself much more invested.
The story itself is broken into two sections: The first and shorter section covers the origins of the virus and its outbreak, while the second is set 93 years after the infections, primarily following a colony of survivors living in California.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نوزدهم ماه جولای سال 2015 میلادیعنوان: گذرگاه دوجلدی از کتاب 1 سه گانه گذرگاه؛ نویسنده: جاستین کرونین؛ مترجم: محمد جوادی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، کتابسرای تندیس، 1392، کتاب 1 در 1104 ص، شابک دو جلدی: 9786001820854؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی سده 21 مداستان گذرگاه، در آینده ای نزدیک و دنیایی آخرالزمانی روی میدهد.
Međutim kako svaki put kad dođem u knjižnicu ova knjiga tužno stoji sama na polici ko neko siroče, a ja nisam imala srca ostavit je tamo samu preko blagdana, nije bilo druge nego da je ponesem doma.Sve počinje jednim tajnim projektom pod vodstvom vojske, jer normalno, vojska je uvijek zadužena za sva sranja.
Sviđa mi se kako vješto osvježio i ubacio u priču neke već toliko izlizane motive.Radnja je spora i temeljita u toj mjeri da ponekad zna ići na živce, razlog k tomu su preopširni opisi koji su glavni nedostatak ove knjige, iz zbog kojih se često činilo da radnja stoji u mjestu.Usprkos tome mora se priznati da je čovjek smislio kompleksnu, intezivnu priču koja mami čitatelja na još.
Thank you, GoodReads for this Advance Reader's Edition. So hard to rate. Act I is simply superb - brilliantly written, suspenseful, beautiful, a full 5. Act II is cluttered, (too) many actors moving on and off stage, rarely doing anything of consequence while they are there. Act III is a combination screenplay, set-up for a sequel, exciting in a dystopian, end-of-days sort of way, (with a ray or two of hope).
I've had this book and the second of it's series for awhile. They set on my bookshelf and just look pretty. I would have read them one day...and then the third one came up on Netgalley. I have a Netgalley problem and I requested it, thinking that it would push me to read these. Yeah right.Then my buddy Edward Lorn started reading this. He started posting updates. He teased me enough that I couldn't keep ignoring these books. Damn it.  So this does have one of my favorite 'end-of-the-world' thing
I would have read them one day...and then the third one came up on Netgalley.
Yeah right.Then my buddy Edward Lorn started reading this.
He teased me enough that I couldn't keep ignoring these books.
Things NEVER EVER NEVER work out when they start tampering with sciency stuff.
But I'm trying to be good and that Ed Lorn kept posting updates about how it got better and he is a dang old book pusher and I kept reading.
DAMN IT!I also did not like another thing about this book.
I didn't put the book down once it started.
I feel that I need to explain my one star rating.Firstly, it's really not that bad, it’s just that I always award one star to any book I feel compelled to abandon before the end, and I didn't get beyond half way on this one.
I like apocalyptic tales of the end of the world as we know it.
Books such as  The Stand and  Seveneves cover the initial catastrophe and its immediate aftermath really well, but then they descend in to fantasy and far future science fiction, respectively.
Daher bin ich auch sehr gespannt auf die Verfilmung, was die so kann.Zum Inhalt möchte ich gar nicht wirklich etwas sagen, allein weil sooooo viel passiert und es den Charme dieses Buches ausmacht, dass man den Großteil der Zeit absolut keinen Plan hat wohin die Geschichte noch will.Sagen kann ich allerdings, dass ich sämtliche Charaktere super authentisch dargestellt fand und die Spannung fast durchgehend gleichbleibend hoch war.Vor allem die zweite Hälfte hat mich sehr gefesselt, dennoch konnte ich selten mehr als 100 Seiten am Stück lesen, einfach weil ich das gelesene erst einmal verdauen/verarbeiten/verstehen musste.Das ist kein Buch für nebenher, sondern ein grandioser Auftakt eines hoffentlich genauso grandiosen Endzeit-Epos für Erwachsene.
A combination of King's The Stand, McCarthy's The Road, and the movie I Am Legend.Very engrossing; the first third reads like sci-fi thriller, thoroughly setting up the scenarios of the plague that alters the world.
Knowing now that the book is the first in a trilogy, I think Cronin would have been better served ending the first here, with central characters departing on their heroes' journey.
Too many characters resolving too neatly; too many details about the viral plague explained mystically, rather than scientifically.
I know that some of these answers may be resolved by Book 2, but would love anyone's theory about just this one sentence from page 759: "Like Peter, what he was.
The first logical question a this point would be, " What the heck does Kant who lived in eighteenth century have anything to do with the book I am trying to review here?" With all of his brilliant contributions to philosophy - and I would be the first one to admit they were brilliant - Kant was not exactly get-to-the point kind of guy.
In fact I think Cronin created a brand new type of flashbacks - one ones with changing POVs. The most frustrating part: about half of the characters with flashbacks would be killed two pages after the tale comes back to present day.
In other words, they become modern Draculas but in an intriguing and very disturbing way (not like Edward in Twilight!).
I was in the mood for a dystopian read and I definitely got one with this book.
I’m pleased to have finished it (because it is after all 1000 pages long!), but I’m also pleased that there are two more books to come since this is a trilogy.
The dystopian aspect of it was also interesting and cleverly thought out, but it was the characters that I really fell in love with.
But ultimately, it stumbles and staggers under the weight of all the hype and Cronin's inability to sustain the pace and promise of his first 200 brilliant pages.The novel turns on the U.S. Army's botched experiments to breed immortal, indestructible super-soldiers by injecting them with tricked-up serums from a vampiric bat virus discovered deep in the Bolivian jungle, using 12 expendable death-row inmates and an abandoned 9-year-old girl named Amy as the test subjects.Instead, the 12 inmates transmute into vicious, vampirelike creatures who escape and then quickly decimate an entire nation of on-the-run humans with their infectious bites.
I can't even remember (or care) about anyone's names...
It's post-apocalyptic survival.
But, I don't care about any of the characters and it goes on and on and on and on and on...
I wish there was more about the virals besides them being like zombies.
It's like The Walking Dead, but less interesting.:/You can't say I didn't try.
:PPrevious post:July 11, 2017: Giving this another go on audio since my library had it!
Edward Hermann narrates and I think this is going to work!
:)Original post:I am putting this one on hold for now.
I only got to 16%, but do plan to try it again in the future.
Although the story dark because the whole world is experiencing apocalypse enormity scale, the book tells the story about people who find themselves in these catastrophic times, who are struggling for daily survival even though the survival conditions are minimal.
But in moments in the book I have too many descriptions that sometimes draw attention to the main story, despite everything in the story have tense and the reader does not know who will survive and who dies.
Regardless, this is a very good book with a post-apocalyptic story featuring vampires - Viral.
The characters and story in the book are well elaborated, if you love stories about vampires and post-apocalyptic world, this is a book for you.
It looks good but I hope more focus is given to the science bits vs.
but was well worth it.This is a novel about a transformed world full of vampires, but it is nothing like anything out there today and is the most original story I have read in a long time.
The details of all the storylines and the depth shown in each and everyone of the characters...
this was a treat, a gem, and I am so glad to have read this novel.
Well I can honestly say I was a bit frustrated because I wanted MORE.
I AM BABCOCK.I have never, ever, ever read about the world going to s*** in a more realistic way.
I understand why many people didn’t like the second half of the book; it was because the first part was so damn good that everyone wished it would never end!
But I came to the conclusion that as it is, the story is perfect.
Perfect.
The kind of perfect that isn’t going to bore you even after 1000 pages.
Dude, it’s Stephen King level.
Even more, it’s The Dark Tower level.I have one more thing to say...You guessed it.I AM BABCOCK.
