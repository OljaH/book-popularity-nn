The job of the fantasy-horror writer is to make you, for a little while, a child again.Most children experience more during one summer vacation than some adults throughout their whole life; They have their precious innocence, they haven't been spoiled by work, by taxes, by bills and other things that each of us has to face at some point in life.
I had checked out at that point and simply wanted it to be over no matter who lived or died or whether they defeated It or not.This book is at least 300 pages too long and that is the least that could have been completely cut out without hurting the story in the slightest.
5. And, the scene which blew me away and pretty much made me feel I had wasted time getting that far in: a gang-bang consisting of nothing but 11 and 12-year-olds.
I read this entire book in one day during my 24-hour readathon, #readathonbyzoe!
I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the novel, and I definitely did not sleep well the following night!
This is one of the best horror novels I've ever read.
However, I hate his constant use of slurs against black, Jewish, and gay characters.
I understand that he is using them as a tool to highlight the real horrors in our everyday lives, but it was 100% not necessary to use them with such frequency.
As a grown woman, the only thing that brings the feeling of dread into my heart is the constant pinging of new work emails requiring my attention when I'm at home, but there was a time when I was a shy, delicate, sweet little girl who was scared of my own shadow.Proof: not exactly the terror you see haunting the hallowed halls of Goodreads handing out 1 stars like they're candy these days.It wasn't until I was around 20 that I outgrew my fear of scary creatures and things, and stopped tucking in my toes between the blankets, lest they get eaten by monsters, but before that happened...there was It. I can say with complete confidence that this goddamn book (and the movie) scarred me for life.A sentiment that I'm sure many of you who have read the book and seen the movie echoes.I remember the exact moment I saw this movie.
I love the camaraderie between the friends and how they believe each others stories of meeting Pennywise, even when he wasn't in clown form.
At one point they think they kill ole Pennywise, but after many years and the killing of kids starts happening again, Mike, who stayed in Derry at the library, calls everyone home.
Uggggg, clowns!!!!!!!!I know there are some people out there that hasn't read the book so I won't give out any spoilers for them, but one of the group commits suicide before anything even gets started and another of the group gets killed before they kill Pennywise for good..
Fuck you, Stephen King. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO US? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnCdO...
It is finished.Why yes, I did just complete my longest read to date.
I simultaneously feel relieved and accomplished, drained and fulfilled.
There are few authors who can successfully deliver such conflicting feelings, which is why he's one of the most well known names in the fiction world.
I feel as if I could write an entire book about this tender and terrifying "coming of age" tale, but I also feel as if all the umph has left my body for the moment.
Definitely my favorite King novel that I've read so far and I hope to revisit this review after a time of processing and reflection to add more thoughts.
Throughout the book, I was going to give it 4 stars. It was suspenseful, there was a sense of dread with some truly scary scenes. King is very good at describing how children would think and make us feel their fears. It was really long with A LOT of descriptions but it was still very enjoyable.The ending totally ruined it for me...Review: https://youtu.be/TkxckLFcKYE(view spoiler)[What the hell was that with the prepubescent gang-bang... (hide spoiler)]
A publisher with an eye for more book sales might have convinced a writer, a different writer than Stephen King, to pull these books apart and sell them in two separate novels, but I’m afraid we might have been talking about two three star books instead of one five star book.
But what exactly is IT?”Glamour, he said, was the Gaelic name for the creature which was haunting Derry; other races and other cultures other times had different words for it, but they all mean the same thing.
Only Stephen King can begin a novel with such a horrific murder and keep readers glued to the pages.

Stephen King'King's mind - truly scary and Derry - not somewhere I am ever going on vacation!Original review:This is one of the essential King reads - it is quite a big one, though!I once heard that Stephen King felt he shoved so much into it he should have called it "shIT" - (can't remember where I read that and I cannot find the reference at the moment, so maybe this is just a really cool myth)I read this book years ago - I was in my early teens - so I was not much older than the main characters.
Because of that, I think the terror was more real.I also remember that this book had some of the most terrifying and heart-wrenching scenes I have ever read.
You can't be clowning about IT!!!  THOSE TERRIFYING CLOWNS It was easier to be brave when you were someone else.It's kinda..."funny" how such characters, the clowns, that they are supposed to make us laugh, and not matter that, you can find just too much examples of "evil clowns", many from fantasy but even at least one from horrific reality, that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley...or any place at all!!!The Joker, Stitches, Homie from The Simpsons, Punchinello from Dean Koontz's Life E
It was easier to be brave when you were someone else.It's kinda..."funny" how such characters, the clowns, that they are supposed to make us laugh, and not matter that, you can find just too much examples of "evil clowns", many from fantasy but even at least one from horrific reality, that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley...or any place at all!!!The Joker, Stitches, Homie from The Simpsons, Punchinello from Dean Koontz's Life Expectancy, The alien clowns from Killer Klowns from Outer Space movie, Doctor Who's Robot Clowns, Spawn's Violator, Rob Zombie's Captain Spaulding, Fucko from the Scary or Die film, The Clown Doll from the Amusement film, also the quite recently Twisty from the Fourth Season of American Horror Story, and even, from real life, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy aka The Killer Clown.Even, while not terrifying, but indeed quite annoying, there is Binky from Garfield cartoons.And those are only the examples that came easier to my mind and that I watched or read about at some point.
(That always surprises people.) Anyway, my name is Annie Wilkes Stepheny and I’ll be your tour guide!We’re going to go where it all begins- the most infamous storm drain in all the lands.
It was created in Maine and that is why he is displaying it here.(And no, I don't know what it's called, just that it is used to pick up and move logs.) Richie was resting on a bench after being chased by Henry Bowers and Co when he is “awoken” by this statue coming to life.
It’s about accepting responsibility even when you don’t want to.I love this book as it has become a part of me.
At times I did enjoy the book but it was just really long with so many characters and details and a lot of the time I felt myself getting bored like I didn't need such exact descriptions of the boat flowing down the sewer and the way it kept cutting back and forth especially towards the end between past and present just felt choppy and maybe that was the point but it just made me not get really into the book.
I do like Stephen King and he writes very well but this one just did not work for me and I guess I just missed something because everyone else seems to have really enjoyed this book.
I still have a small scar on my leg from when we thought we saw Pennywise's likeness burned into the side of her dad's old farmhouse, and we both took off running through what was in all likelihood, a condemned building.
I plowed into an old nail that was sticking out of the wall and ripped a hole in my leg in an effort to escape the killer clown.No, I did not get a tetanus shot.
We were idiotic teenage girls and my incoherent squealing that Pennywise had slashed my leg with his claws was feeding the hysteria of the moment.And thanks to that scar, 20 plus years later this book still haunts my ass.
Stephen King already did a practice run with The Body, but this time he tops himself.It is a drama novel.
Le paure rinnovate di adulti mai cresciuti fino in fondo, che si trovano di nuovo a sprofondare nell'abisso della disperazione.E ancora: romanzo dell'amicizia e della solidarietà, romanzo violento con storie violente di bullismo e alcolismo, romanzo del riscatto.
Romanzo che andrebbe letto due volte, sia da ragazzi che da adulti, per calarsi nei panni dei personaggi come un gioco di ruolo ed apprezzarlo all'inverosimile, ed io per fortuna l'ho fatto.
I also thought it was neat how in the last part of the book, sometimes it wasn't entirely clear whether or not you were reading about the past or the present, but it still made sense somehow.Lastly, I love how Stephen King deals with the idea of fear and how it can become a physical thing.
So I will say if you're wary of picking up this book because you think it will be full of scary stuff, I'd say don't worry; the new movie is scarier (and even then, it's mostly just bloody).I want to say EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS but at the same time I know it's definitely not for everybody.
Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.It is 1958 in the small town of Derry, Maine and several children have been found murdered.
Pennywise – or It – is not as prevalent in the book as one might presume, given its classification as a horror novel, but any time It makes an appearance, the narrative drops readers into a dark scene where terrifying events unfold.
Though it contains elements of horror, It is a literary coming of age story that just happens to take place in a small town were horrific events transpire.
I go into more detail in my original review two years ago below but here are a few additional thoughts from my reading this time around:This book will always hold a special place in my heart, it was what I was reading when my son was born two years ago.
Part of me still thinks that The Stand is his best but It certainly has the best group of characters in any of his books, or any book ever.
Suffice to say I'm extra scared to go for a walk!Above all, the best thing about this book is that it's wonderful.

with a deep sigh, she closes the book and steals a glance at the clock.
its barely 10pm and she knows its already beginning.she can feel it in the way her body tenses at every noise that threatens the peaceful quiet.
its the onset of fear.how silly she is for reading a horror book at such an hour!
she melts further beneath the covers, wondering how long its physically possible for a person to go without sleep.
for in sleep, the fears become real.
for in sleep, nightmares thrive.
she resigns herself for a long night.↠ 3.5 stars
Pennywise eligió un mal momento para regresar, ya que se va a tener que enfrentar a Los Perdedores, ese peculiar grupo de amigos que lo tratará de derrotar y así impedir que siga asesinando.El segundo tiempo transcurre en 1985, cuando los chicos ya son adultos y Mike Hanlon, por una promesa realizada en 1958, les escribe diciéndoles que Eso ha vuelto.
Por lo tanto se ven obligados a volver a Derry, al lugar donde comenzó todo, para esta vez derrotarlo por siempre y evitar que siga haciendo más daño.El libro es una completa obra maestra.
The thing with King’s horror books is that...
I never thought they were scary.
I see people talking about how scary his books are.
IT especially.This is one of those books that make me think I would read King’s shopping list if I could.
See the TURTLE of Enormous GirthOn his shell he holds the Earth.His thought is slow, but always kind.He holds us all within his mind.On his back all vows are made;He sees the truth but mayn't aid.He loves the land and loves the sea,And even loves a child like me.
For those who can catch them, they are fuckin’ delicious.*I don’t usually reread books, but if I were to reread something, IT would be on the list.
These seven kids eventually band together into a self-proclaimed Loser’s Club dedicated to destroy the evil they call It.In 1985 the members of the Losers are called together again in order to fulfill a childhood promise to return to Derry if It ever returned.
The idea that there’s an underage gang bang on poor Bev to reestablish the connection between the Losers when they’re lost in the sewers after facing It the first time is completely unnecessary and puts a layer of 'Ewww!' all over the childhood relationships.* Poor Bev really gets the worst of it in a lot of ways in this book.
From the tenebrous depths of the abyss, comes an unimaginable tale of perennial terror that is feverish, jarring, and insidious. With meandering prose and vivid descriptions, King dazzles, stupefies, and petrifies readers down to their core by invoking their atavistic fears, transmogrifying it, and assuming the shape of the thing that one is most afraid of. "The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years — if it ever did end — began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made
With meandering prose and vivid descriptions, King dazzles, stupefies, and petrifies readers down to their core by invoking their atavistic fears, transmogrifying it, and assuming the shape of the thing that one is most afraid of.
Derry, Maine (1957-1958 and 1984-1985)- Seven misfits (Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, Mike Hanlon, and Stanley Uris) form an unlikely fellowship in 1957/1958 to obliterate a fiendish entity that lurks in the shadows slaughtering and feasting on juveniles.
Twenty-seven years later (1984/1985), mysterious disappearances reoccur and mutilated bodies are found.
They swore to end It twenty-seven years ago.
But you knew this before starting It. It’s Stephen King for fucks sake.2.
King finds a way in his writing to make humans scarier then the monster of Pennywise.
If you’ve read the book, YOU know what I’m talking about.If you’ve only seen the TV Mini-Series or the 1st chapter in the It movies, then move right along.
It’s about friendship, growing up, overcoming adversaries and wrecking vengeance on evil.I loved this part of the book.
King really knows how to write this well and I felt so much affection for all the main characters in the Losers' Club!9.
Definitely one of King's most memorable, creative and well-written books.
I've seen the TV movie too when I was twelve years old but the movie only left me confused.
The book is much longer and more detailed, giving an explanation to what exactly the shapeshifting clown boogeyman is and why it chose Derry's sewers to reside in.
King obviously put a lot of time into this huge book and it's one that any horror fan should add to their reading list.
After all, it's got everything from evil clowns to old school memories.
It's one of the weirdest and most disturbing but excellent horror novels I've ever read.
Sure, I very much liked that King made them realistic (the kids had good and annoying qualities - they weren't some unrealistic little angels), but some flaws were just too bad to be ignored (yes, I'm looking at you, Bev - and no, I don't care how hard your life was from an early age on, many suffer like you did without turning out the way you did).The central theme of this book is fear.
Yes, this book is primarily a horror novel, and Stephen King's imagination is at full force in this one.
Yes, I understand how pacing works, and obviously, if scary things happen on every single page, they quickly lose their impact, so I could appreciate what King was going for.
The final battle wasn't bad enough to ruin the book for me, but it did cause me to deduct a star.Still, even though it loses its way towards the end, this book is highly recommended for anyone who loves horror, as well as for anyone who is looking for a powerful, complex story and doesn't mind being terrified and disturbed throughout.
“Maybe there aren't any such things as good friends or bad friends - maybe there are just friends, people who stand by you when you're hurt and who help you feel not so lonely.”1200 pages are long.
I believe that this book would have been a lot better if you had cut out 200 pages or more.
So you are basically sitting, reading, waiting for it to start and it won't happen until you've read 1000 pages.
On one hand, I get what Stephen King was trying to do, on the other I don't think it was essential to the story, or at least not in that way.
And as I looked back at the bright paperback, fresh blood started dripping from its open pages.....
The only clowns we have here are Macdonald's!) But I saw a lot of blood in my dreams....
The story offers straight out horror rather than terror most of the time.
I know that's what makes King's writing style special and for most of the part, it makes the story feel too damn real.
But there are times when it simply drags.Also, just before the ending, the story went a bit weird.
Because his stories are not just about horror.-------------------------------I think I'll never look at the word IT same.DammIT.
