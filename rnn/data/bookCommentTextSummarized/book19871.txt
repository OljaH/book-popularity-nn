Christian is dripping ice cream all over Ana, and I was going, "Ewwww!" because I really hate the stickiness of sugary foods anywhere on my body, and can you imagine that shit getting in your hair?
After watching a fireworks display (during which Ana was awed like a fucking four-year-old), I was treated to this exchange: Christian: 
Taylor has to forcibly remove Ana from her apartment, and the whole time we're treated to Ana's bullshit thoughts regarding whether or not Christian is going to leave her for Leila.
So, if you, like me, like TOO DAMN MANY of us, find yourself with a set of the FSoG trilogy you no longer want, I've compiled a helpful list of ways you can re-use, re-purpose or recycle them!
FUNKY PAPER EARRINGSStep One: Tear out two pages from any of the FSoG books.
PAPER FLOWERSStep One: Take some of those leftover white pages and cut them in half.Step Two: Fold them once, twice, three times.
Step Two: Find those pretteh butterflies and flowers you just made and glue those adorable little paper beauties onto that ugly ass wreath.
2 miserable stars Ok. There's a dangerous theme in this book that I want to speak out about: Ladies, despite what EL James says,  you will not change your man's personality or fix his age-old sexual perversions in 5 weeks.I thought part one of Fifty Shades series was too tense and upsetting, but be careful what you wish for...
This book was not as tense, but it wasn't as interesting either.
And when Christian F*'s up in this book, he does unforgivable things that Ana doesn't really deal with.
****update*** I did not read the last book.
Every negative experience holds the seed of transformation.” Reading Fifty Shades Darker is like witnessing metamorphosis in action.
This is truly one of the most amazing love stories I’ve read.
I would like to add one more thing regarding a popular misconception about this book.
I’ve read other BDSM novels and I think these books should really be classified as mild erotica, which contain some MILD elements of BDSM.
It really is just an amazing and beautiful love story, and I think the BDSM elements are an integral element the plot in this novel.
The missus bought a Paperback ...down Tesco, Saturday, I had a look inside her bag;.......T'was "fifty shades of grey".
Well I just left her to it, And at ten I went to bed.
Well fifty years or so ago; I might have had a peek; But Mabel hasn't weathered well; .....
She stood there nude and naked Bent forward just a bit I went to hold her, sensual like and stood on her left tit!
Mabel screamed, her teeth shot out; My god what had I done!?
Suffice to say my jet black hair, Turned fifty shades of Grey.
HUGE improvement compared to Fifty Shades of Grey! Still not AMAZING but not bad at all, I honestly enjoyed reading Fifty Shades Darker and I'm looking forward to read Fifty Shades Freed!

This time I listened to the audio book and I loved it!
And that’s only a start – it doesn’t even include how insecure she gets every time Mrs Robinson or Christian’s ex-subs are mentioned.
You can’t skip on content by filling it with clumsy and repetitive sex scenes.Then there’s Christian *eye twitches*Move over Edward Cullen, we have a new creepy stalker lover with some seriously fucked up control issues.Sorry Edward, I’m afraid you’ll have to relinquish your crown.
Oh wait, I forgot how he would like to lock her up in his Red Room of Pain and tie her up to all sorts of things.Whilst we’re on the subject, please don’t try to convince me he’s running a multi-billion corporation.
It never happens, but, during the time I was reading Fifty Shades Darker, I was doing some research online for something altogether unrelated, and I came across the following quote.
This second installment of Christian and Ana's journey has all of the emotion and depth that I felt was missing somewhat from the first book.
I am fairly certain I experienced every possible emotion toward and for him, and, in the end, I was as hopelessly in love with him as Ana. Violated by people who had a responsibility, as parent and authority figure, to protect and nurture him, he hid a truly damaged little boy behind a wall of BDSM.

Another great book by E.L. James. I loved this book even more than the first!!  "I don't want to fight with you, Anastasia.

Christian really grows and heals so much in this book , and it was a beautiful thing to read.
I want you, and the thought of anyone else having you is like a knife twisting in my dark soul.""I've never felt the way I felt when you left, Anastasia.
She was worried that she wouldn't be enough to keep Christian happy, but by the end of the book she starts to realize that she is just what he needs.

James and enter the Fiction Vixen Book Reviews giveaway to win a copy of this book!  4.5 stars I loved it. It was a different experience than the first one; the pace is much slower, even though there are a lot of outside forces and complications when there weren't in the previous one. The chemistry is as sizzling as ever though (whew! *fan please!*), the romance is sweeter, and ther
*wink* *wink*Christian Grey, a.k.a. Fifty Shades, a.k.a. One of the Best "Romance" Heroes Ever.
Never became unsexy though, which I feel like it could easily have become, so James pulled that off well.I did start to question his beyond-anything desire for and dependence on Ana. That may have something to do with the fact that she was annoying me in the first half of the book of course (see below).
Note on Fifty Shade series and book endings.
It's basically one long story broken up into three parts, so start with the first Fifty Shades book, 
Then I found myself suddenly left with nothing to read on my Kindle except this, so I went for it.I just dislike everything about this book: the pathetic writing, the "plot" if you can call it that, Christian Grey (aka The Jackass), and Anastasia Steele (aka The Doormat).
Not only is his character completely unbelievable (he earns $100,000 every hour, has a personal trainer and a body of a god but eats bacon, sauce bernaise and macaroni and cheese every day, is a CEO but put in about 2 hours of actual work every day that is interrupted every minute by writing emails to control and surveil The Doormat at work) but he's not at all attractive.
But my god, I have never read such boring and repetitive sex scenes in an erotic novel.
I honestly do not have time to read right now.
Following Grey and Ana was my favorite entertainment.
I need to clarify whet I expect from a book.
A good book will delivery you right back to your own life's favorite moments.
I love when I get to read a complete series.
Read this story if you want a good time.
It will give you everything you need as a reader though, I highly recommend this series.
Trying to savor it because you only get to read these books once for the first time.
My review of the first installment is applicable across this entire pathetic, thieving enterprise.My Fifty Shades of Grey review. My Fifty Shades Freed review.My review of the Bundle. It includes some important points I didn't include in these reviews.
1. Ana acts like an overly 'innocent' teenager despite being an able career woman in her early 20's.
The annoying inner goddess has been joined by Ana's subconscious, acting like the ego and id perched on her left shoulder.
Having arguments over email, Christian getting overly needy and possessive, Ana being stupid, it's all so annoying.I think I've had enough of Fifty Shades.
I've heard the concluding book is even worse than this one, and I have better things to do with my life.Check out my blog for the review on Fifty Shades of Grey.
A story of how love can conquer all.ReliefThe cliffhanger-ending of Fifty Shades of Grey had me in an uproar.
Tough stuff that made me very emotional and I even shed a few tears.On a brighter note: I was so happy to see Ana and Fifty back together, despite the hardships I knew they’d have to overcome.HeartacheThroughout the first book I was wondering about Fifty’s past.
I was given a lot more insight reading Fifty Shades Darker.
That just now was a reference to Fifty Shades #1 by the way.
5 stars to Fifty Shades Darker by E L James.
*****FIVE++++ HEARTS & FLOWERS STARS*****{BR with Dee, Mel, and Sharon}Re-Read #4!!! "This is me, Ana. All of me...and I'm all yours. What do I have to do to make you realize that? To make you see that I want you any way I can get you. That I love you."  I remember when I first read FSOG, I thought Christian was perfect. He was so very Sexy and Dominant. He was my perfect man. I didn't think he could get any better, and then I read this book. I think I fell hopelessly in love with him by the
I remember when I first read FSOG, I thought Christian was perfect.
I didn't think he could get any better, and then I read this book.
I think I fell hopelessly in love with him by the time I finished book two.
Out of all three books, I think this is the one where Christian really shines.
This is how Christian feels he can connect with Ana and believes that sex resolves all of their little arguments.
And there were quite a few arguments!!I forgot how annoying Ana could be.
I still can't believe how much enjoyment I got out of reading this again for the fourth time.
These were one of the first sets of books I read when I first started reading series and were a HUGE part of what inspired me to start reading and blogging again but at the time that I read them, I still wasn’t writing real reviews.
These books have made my heart burst and break, made me laugh and cry… It is definitely one of my favorite series ever.
The depth to which the characters are taken and described is beyond words.A wonderful blend of HOT HOT HOT kinky fuckery and a deep emotional journey and love story… this is one of those series that will stay with you forever!!!I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend these books.
Re-read in January 2015.This was my sixth time reading this book.
I wanted at least one last time before the movie is released next month.
This time I listened to the audio version and was not impressed.
I actually found it annoying but I had waited 6 months on hold at the library for the audio so I was bound and determined to finish it.
Only one more book to go before I'll get to see Mr. Grey on the big screen.
✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦"Master is dark...Master is a dark man.""He's my happily ever after."
Re-read this one for the fifth time.
* He doesn’t want Ana to touch her – they even have to draw a roadmap on his body to mark the parts she is and isn’t allowed to touch – and gets mad when she tries anyway, yet blatantly ignores all of her boundaries.* “Hmm, well, this is one way to ensure you eat – force-feed you.
Lucky him.* He has to hear from her every goddamn hour or he becomes worried.* Ana nearly gets raped at work, and instead of being a supportive boyfriend, Christian yells at her and calls her stupid for not using her Blackberry to e-mail him.It’s not like Anastasia is any better, either.
The second half wasn't as bad, but the first half felt like a continuing repeat of the initial book.Still hating the inner goddess thing.
It's like Ana's talking to another version of herself in her head.Getting tired of all the smirks.
Does Christian make any other facial expression?These books are a bit warped, but I have less of an issue reading about warped than I do reading about repetitive behaviors and inner goddesses.The steam level was decent, but nothing way out there.
The emails were still the only cute part of the book.
I think the relationship was wayyyy too rushed, but whatever.
I feel like the sun has set and not risen for five days, Ana. I’m in perpetual night here."And I was all....Finally, we get some romantic statements in our smut book!
We still have the child molester Mrs. Robinson aka Elena, who Ana and his mother finally put in her place and that scene made the whole book worth reading for me.
I know, that's a gross exaggeration, but I do believe that everyone should read more books.
By the way, this book would have been a 5 star read if It had less INNER GODDESS MOMENTS (annoying ass introspection) , less "baby" "laters" and other very very repetitive words choices.
Jeez...Just cause a guy insists on controlling every aspect of your life, and maybe wants to beat you with a cane on the weekends, you're gonna leave?
In fact, as the book wore on, I began to think that she may be the stupidest heroine (I use that word lightly) ever written.Her inner monologue revealed that her brain consisted of cotton candy and something called an 
Jeez...I'm not sure I want you fisting me with all that dirt under your fingernails!But, I did get quite a few laughs out of this book.
Idiot.P.S.In case you were wondering, Ana uses the word Jeez...a lot.
This is my favorite book in this series, what i loved about it is that they were both equals , both in control.i loved it and ain't sorry :p :p
Exactly why I won't torture myself with it anymore...Precisely what possessed me to have a look at ##2+3, right after I got tired of #1? Ughhh, curiousity killed the cat and made me read a large chunk of the 50 shades trilogy, thus surely killing a lot of unlucky braincells of mine .
This book focuses more upon the evolution of Christian’s and Ana’s relationship.
Christian senses that Ana needs a more conventional relationship and attempts to provide it for her in his own special way.
Ana also becomes more daring and assertive and she stands up to threats to her relationship with Christian.I loved the dialogue and banter between these two characters, especially the emails where they used SHOUTY CAPITALS.
It is interesting to note that Ana’s email communications with Christian were uninhibited.
I found that Ana and Christian were much more playful in this book.
“This is me, Ana. All of me...and I'm all yours. What do I have to do to make you realize that? To make you see that I want you any way I can get you. That I love you.”  Admittedly Fifty Shades Darker is better than Fifty Shades Grey, and it's not beacause of the writing that was improved or more flowery, but the story itself that really got me. After dumping Christian, Ana is doing fine with a new job and she tries to adjust her life without this Christian even though it's hard. But Christian
Admittedly Fifty Shades Darker is better than Fifty Shades Grey, and it's not beacause of the writing that was improved or more flowery, but the story itself that really got me.
Christian being a better man impressed me, even though Ana was annoying as always I want to roll my eyes a thousand times.
And I was also surprised for the Fifty Shades Freed teaser at the end.I loved the story of this book indeed.
I like that Christian goes crazy when he thinks Ana wants to leave hima again, it's kinda romantic and warm.
This is one of the most moving love stories you can ever read.
It's intensely erotic and sexy at every turn, but that passion is piqued by the meaning and essence behind Ana and Christian's relationship.
But I digress...Fifty is back in book two, bossy as ever (never far), but he is an entirely different character in this book, and from the moment he reunites with Ana, he's a changed man.
I especially loved Ana in this installment.
Their love story, which, truly, fully unfolds in this second installment is deep and powerful, frightening and joyful, functional and dysfunctional, sexy and innocent. Characters like these, a story like this, is why we read.As a final thought, it was very interesting to me to read what seemed almost a deconstruction of Christian's BDSM lifestyle. In a way, it was a refreshing change of pace. Bravo to the author! A story with something of a unique angle is difficult to find in this day and age. Fifty Shades Darker is most definitely a 5-star read!
A couple of weeks ago, I made a bet with [P] to the effect that his review of Fifty Shades of Grey would collect at least 20 votes by the following Monday.
I spent the next few days in an agony of pleasant anticipation, not least because my beautiful and sexy girlfriend discreetly suggested that she would be interested in helping me test it.
Chocolate, she murmured, melts in the mouth.
I wasn't quite certain what she meant, but I looked forward to finding out more.And now, this morning, I went downstairs to collect the post, and this is what I found:At first, I couldn't even understand what it was, so great was my disappointment.
