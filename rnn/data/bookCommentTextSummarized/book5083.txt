To safeguard himself he wrote a letter with proof of this to be delivered to authorities in case of his death.
Mason's client asked the lawyer to get hold of the letter saying that it is all lies meant to destroy her reputation.
Shortly after Mason agreed to represent her the aunt called saying the husband died.
I am not sure about Mason himself, but I was very much surprised by the content of the letter.
Read and try to figure out what was going on.
In case you still have not figured it out this series is one of the best mysteries there is - at least for me.
After a long time, a truly confusing mystery. I admit I Did Not see the end.. not even a vague idea about it. It hooked me proper. Worth a read.
A routine Perry Mason mystery. Man is traveling, gets sick, checks into motel, calls doctor, dies in front of doctor. Doctor locks room, calls police, no body in room. Man's wife is arrested for murder. Perry saves her behind. Recommended only to Perry Mason fans.
I LOVE PERRY MASON BOOKS! I found my dads collection when I was 12, and I read every one I could get my hands on. Its great if you want to step back into a time when girls were "dames" and the craziest schemes were the perfect way to win court cases and solve crimes. Think Casablanca meets Nancy Drew
Read it 20 years ago, before Goodreads, so, marked.I read this book when I still loved detective stories back then. Still am, but I need a bit or more romance in my books that is.
One of my earliest Perry Mason stories...read it as a teenager in Karachi and was hooked to legal fiction!!! No way near Scott Turow of course but what a help he was in my spoken fencing skills!!!
This one was a good one. I was able to get pretty far into this one before figuring out the mystery. These still crack me up with the male/female dynamic.
The Case of the Runaway Corpse is my first Perry Mason novel, and I was definitely happy with it!
In this detective novel, Perry Mason is hired by an unhappily married woman with a dying husband.
His wife, Myrna Davenport, knows that her husband has allegedly written a letter that will be delivered to the authorities if/when he dies.
Her husband hasn't died just yet, though his death seems certain, when she hires Perry Mason to help her manage her estate.
She gives Mason a key to her husband's office, a key for Mason to use once her husband has died.
One thing different are the couple dozen pages of legal back and forth.
The first set is overly lengthy for reasons given in the book.
But would have been best to edit a page or two.
Editing that and needless repetition of many story points.Otherwise this is a solid murder mystery that makes little sense until the end.
Also included are solid characters.
The settings are also very good as these are important to the story.
Again, I believe this would have been a better story trimming it ten pages or so.
6 out of ten points.

Good mystery. I stopped to think about the solution several times and got one part of it right, but not the details. Laughed at some fun banter between Perry and Della. I really liked the DA in this one. I would have liked to have seen less courtroom, more action, but still a good story nonetheless.
This starts out with a client afraid he will be murdered by his wife. But when his murder is reported the corpse can not be found. Mason locates it in a motel room, but it disappears from there before he can report it to police. Mason of course has a client accused of the murder and he has to solve the crime and why someone keeps moving the corpse. A pretty good mystery.
One of the most fast-paced murder mysteries I have ever read. Perry Mason is quick, witty, charming, and outright brilliant. The ending was a bit of a wet mop on the whole pace of the book but I really don't see how else it could have gone. It did keep me guessing until almost the end though. A quick and easy read, try it!
My rating is 3.5 (goodreads doesnt allow)This did not involve much courtroom drama. Some parts felt repetitive. Not too thick a plot. There were so many constraints in the story that only a few outcomes were possible. So the reveal was not very surprising.
A great mystery, lots of twists, the biggest one being the DA and Mason's mutual cooperation to see the right person behind bars. The courtroom revelation is electric, easing into a nice toast, "To crime."
I've probably read about 10 Perry Mason books over the years, and they run from "really fun" to "crappy." This is pretty good, the best of it being the intelligence displayed by the characters.
Perry Mason does it again. good characters, good plot. 1 corpse...how many poisons?
An excellent book! The one I desperately wanted to be the murderer wasn't the murderer, so a little disappointed. But that's hardly the author's fault. :D
The personalities of Perry and Della come out funnier in the book than in the old TV series. It was fun reading.
I loved Perry Mason's character and would definitely read more of this series!
I've been a Perry Mason fan for years and I couldn't help reading the book using the voices of the actors in the TV show. The book was just as wonderful as the TV show. I look forward to reading as many as I can get my hands on.
One of the snappier entries that is awash in red herrings and confounding clues. One of the rare ones where Mason gets things figured out pretty far in advance and doesn't spend the last act sweating it, too.
This is a keeper.
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
My first Perry Mason book. And I'm hooked to the series ever since. Reading and rereading.
Perry Mason ini “bermain” di pengadilan juga tetapi penyelidikan yang ia lakukan lebih mendalam dan detail, sehingga bisa dibilang ia adalah seorang penasihat hukum sekaligus detektif.Judul buku ini juga cukup bombastis: Kisah Mayat yang Melarikan Diri.
Sampai suatu ketika, si suami ini akhirnya tewas, prasangka menunjuk kepada sang istri, apalagi hubungan mereka pun telah rusak, dan si istri pun telah terbukti menyewa Mason untuk mengambil surat wasiat dari tangan suaminya.
Hal-hal inilah yang membuat saya hanya memberi dua bintang kepada buku ini, awal perkenalan yang cukup buruk, mungkin butuh membaca kisah Perry Mason lain untuk merubah paradigma ini.
Tetapi bagaimana bisa, gramedia sendiri seolah agak malas untuk menerbitkan ulang, satu suarakah dengan saya dalam menilai buku ini?
#44 in the Perry Mason series.
Perry gains an introverted client with an extroverted aunt.
The client is accused of murdering her husband and the aunt wants to dominate the case.
Good fun.Perry Mason series - Her husband was stealing her money, while accusing her of a plot to poison him -- or so claims the frightened young Mrs. Myrna Davenport.
She wants Perry Mason to find the incriminating note her husband left for the authorities accusing her of murder -- especially now that Davenport is dying.
With Davenport finally dead, Perry could become a possible accessory to murder.
I read the first edition of this, but it's not showing, and today isn't the day I feel like doing a separate entry with photographs, number of pages, etc.
Family members squabble over money, a husband thinks his relatives will poison him, Perry, Paul and Della spend a lot of time in San Berdo and Fresno on this one.
A 1954 Chevy is involved, and I actually know what one looks like.
A lot of information about new techniques, for 1954, of tracking poisons in the system of a corpse.
Hmm,did I detect some chemistry between Mr Mason and Ms Street ? Very interesting and dare I say, charming, especially for characters that were supposed to be cardboard caricatures...And the story...well another cold, brutally logical one, with such a sugary ending, that it should be repulsive, but I actually found it sweet...probably because of the general pleasant settings of the novel and the simpler times in which the story is set. And the denouement was well worth the wait.What more does one want from a pulpy, fast paced legal mystery ?
One of the better Perry Mason stories, even if I had figured out the first step at about the same time Perry did. Glad to see a good D.A. finally portrayed.
