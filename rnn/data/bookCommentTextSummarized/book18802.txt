And just when you think life can‚Äôt possibly get any harder or more challenging, sometimes it does.Although the book is primarily told from Auggie‚Äôs perspective, it was a surprise to me when it switched to a few other points of view.
Wonder is written with the kind of sensitivity and insight that I had hoped for when I read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and it went the extra mile to be an uplifting story that made me want to embrace life and the people in it, too.
But this is probably the best such book I've read since Sherman Alexie's The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.The main character August (Auggie) Pullman is a ten-year-old boy with severe facial abnormalities.
Wonder is the story of his fifth grade year, told partly from Auggie's perspective, and partly from the other kids in his life -- his sister Via, her oldest friend Miranda, Via's boyfriend Justin, and Jack and Summer, Auggie's new friends at Beecher Prep.
I'd recommend it without hesitation to most middle grade readers, girls or boys, even those who may not normally pick up realistic fiction.
Watch my review & discussion here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txeTr...What a WONDERful first book of the year! I read this book almost too quickly, I wanted it to last longer. This might be technically a children's book, but it really was such a special and meaningful read and I highly recommend that everyone read this once in their lives!
I related really strongly to the chapters from Via and Summer, in particular.However, I think that the main reason that I just could not connect with this book is that I fundamentally disagree with its central lesson, which boils down to: ‚Äúbe kind.‚Äù To explain myself properly, I need to relate a little history of my own (and this is where this review gets personal).
But there‚Äôs one thing that my friend has always hated even more than curious or disgusted stares: when people asked her why she needed a wheelchair.
Having been home-schooled for many years he is now more vulnerable than ever.Like any person that's a new student, August faces many mixed reactions from fellow students.
I can't gush enough about him.What I particularly love about the book is how we are able to see August through others too.
Of course this is Augusts journey, but it's interesting to see how others see him.
She's always known that August is first priority since her parents are so over -protective over him, but little by little, it's clear that she's starting to grow a little resentful.
"You really are a wonder, Auggie. You are a wonder."I've read this book twice now, and it will definitely always have a special place in my heart. This is a book that makes me laugh, makes me cry, and gives me endless amounts of hope. I love this book, and will probably be giving out copies to my friends and family this Christmas. first read in May 2013
Like, if all the guys in fifth grade were lined up against a wall and I got to choose anyone I wanted to hang out with, I would choose August.‚ÄùSlowly and gradually the children around Auggie begin to realise that he‚Äôs just another normal kid and that his face might look different but that he‚Äôs actually a really cool guy to hang out with.
She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can‚Äôt change my face.‚ÄùStill, there were many moments my heart ached for August and sometimes I just wanted to hug him like his mom.
I have a small surgery this coming Monday in the doctor's office on my nose (thank heavens for the numbing prescription cream) >> before the shots and knife come at me....Then the bigger surgery, Nov. 29th, at the hospital, --so I wanted to see this film (escape from hiding inside my home) --as my inspiration --before more cutting on my face!
Re- READ this last night .....Augie is my inspiration ....The movie opens here Nov. 17th.
With 2 more surgeries on my face this month - forehead and nose area...Little 10 year old Augie is my imaginary friend!!
Looking forward to seeing the film.The author created an incredible character ...
A wonderful read for all ages.
I absolutely loved this story!'Wonder' tells the story of a young boy, August Pullman aka "Auggie", who is going to begin attending school for the first time ever.
Auggie has been homeschooled for years by his mother because he was born with severe facial deformities, requiring multiple operations over the course of his young life.
His story was heartbreaking, but inspiring.It was also easy to relate to the POVs of others, including Jack, the boy who befriends Auggie at school.
'Wonder' is the type of book that should be required reading in schools and I'm glad to hear that it is in some schools already.
I am not saying that it isn't an uplifting story definitely worth being told (and read), but I can't deny that there were a few aspects I had problems with and that the story didn't trigger the emotional reaction I expected it to.Wonder is the story of August Pullman's first year at school.
I somehow doubt it.In the end, when I recapitulate the whole book, there are simply too many "toos" that come to my mind: the different voices were too similar, Auggie‚Äôs parents too good and too understanding, the "villains" too evil, the ending too perfect, the overall tone a little too preachy.
I hate reviewing books that I'm crazy about. I never can get across how wonderful they are. This is one of those books.  Sorry Christina. Words do hurt. The universe has not been kind to Auggie Pullman. He was born with facial deformities. He has had multiple surgeries but he still gets people stopping when they see him and ugly remarks made about him.He had been homeschooled up until the fifth grade due to his many recoveries from the surgeries and I think to protect him from other people.

Middle school.
Middle school kids are the spawns of the devil.
I have no clue how I had a kid that hates books but go figure.
I'm going to purchase this book and I'm going to read every single word of it to him.
It would be pretty impossible to properly review this book without getting just a touch spoilery. I think I could actually sum up rather succinctly what it was that made this book only get three stars from me, and also what I'm sure will be many readers' deciding factor as to whether they will love it or not.

Loved this book so much! Hated the film
‚ÄúI think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.‚ÄùA normal boy, with an unusual face, starting school for the first time in his life.August was born with facial abnormalities, went through lots of operations, but his face still looks far from normal.
Now he's about to start middle school, and because he's been homeschooled by his mom ever since, he's both scared and excited.This book.
While August is clearly the main character, lots of people get their fair share of pages, and I am so, so glad for it.
Wonder follows Auggie as he starts his year until he graduates from the fifth grade.The story is told from multiple viewpoints: Auggie, his sister, her boyfriend, her sister‚Äôs ex-best friend, and two of Auggie‚Äôs friends from school.
I think children are smart enough to know that not every child in Auggie's situation is surrounded with so many wonderful people.
I thought this book was wonderful (pun initially unintended but I'm leaving it in so I guess there is intent behind it now) and I absolutely recommend it to parents and teachers who would like to read something worthwhile and inspirational with children as well as to any readers who enjoy middle grade books.
BE ON THE LOOK OUT üòÉüòÉüòÉIt has taken me a few days to get to this review because I needed to process this book fully.
Auggie was never enrolled in a regular school due to all the times he needed surgery on his face to correct his differences.
Auggie was home schooled by him mother until Auggie was supposed to go into Middle School.
Summer quickly became one of Auggies best friends.
His other best friend is Jack, but he took a little longer to come around...This book brought out a lot of different emotions for me.
Wonder details Auggie's journey into the fifth grade, and serves as a stark and honest portrayal of the problems with being different.I wish every fifth grader read this book.
After reading Wendy's wonderful review, I bought this book for my ten-year-old cousin as a birthday gift, before reading it myself.
Mr. Browne's precepts, Jack Will, Miranda, Justin, Daisy, and even Julian, all played a part in making this book what it was.I want to end my review by thanking R.J. Palacio for writing what will be my birthday gift to every little kid I see for a long time.
I went in expecting sadness, misery, bleakness, joylessness, in the book.
There is a lot of joie de vivre present.This love of life is imbued in the short and fragile chapters of the book.
There is a lesson present in most chapters, but I chose to read it as a thriller, instead of a fable.
I really dreaded something horrible would happen to August.Instead we get a light-toned book that asks us to like it unconditionally.
The multiple narrators don't matter since the focus is only on August.
I raise my glass up, and say :"To August, the boy who lived!".
Super charming! Love this story. CHOOSE KINDNESS!
I think all young kids should read this novel, because 1) teaches sympathy, 2) Stop bullying for someone who doesn't look or act the same, 3) Appreciate others, 4) Anyone and everyone has problems (either big or small) who needs a helping hand, an act of kindness to get through the day, and 5) the world is cruel and not everyone is going to accept who you are at times, but there are plenty of people who will be behind you.
I want to shield my daughter from the mean people in the world, like how August's parents want to protect him from cruel words and bullying.
La lecci√≥n de August es un libro que ten√≠a pendiente de leer desde hace bastantes a√±os.
La manera de narrar de RJ Palacio es espectacular.Uno de los motivos que me han llevado a leer esta novela, aparte de las recomendaciones de amigos, fue el tr√°iler de la pel√≠cula.
Cierra todos los puntos, todo lo que rodea al peque√±o Auggie, y te ayuda a entender muchas decisiones o sentimientos mostrados por los personajes.Se tratan ya no solo temas como el de la cara de August y sus amigos en el colegio, sino las relaciones de pareja, la familia, el aparentar ser algo que no somos para contentar a otros...
"If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary‚Äîthe world really would be a better place."  Hear me out, people of Earth!! You just need to read this book! Like right now! *Look who's sayin' this. One who was also delaying in reading this precious gem.*Okay, I am confessing. I didn't read this book after pure desire. No! Fortunately, It got selected in our buddy read in Pakistani Readers group. A
You just need to read this book!
I didn't read this book after pure desire.
So I am thankful to him.This book is about the life of a facially deformed boy, August.
But at last her mom decided to send him to school in fifth grade.
August had mom & dad who loved him soo much.
-I really loved the way Via (Olivia's nick name) was portrayed.
Second is, I didn‚Äôt like August's nick name, "Auggie"?
"August" sounds way much better.Forget what I just said!
THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ.
And I don‚Äôt think anyone can hate empathy.
Is also the story of the people around him and of their way of living with Auggie and that is probably what makes it so heartfelt.WONDER is also a work to learn from.
Maybe the book was written for a younger audience, but I don‚Äôt think anyone that read it could say it isn‚Äôt mature enough.There are points in the story which felt so rewarding that I actually clapped, as stupid as that may sound.
Fitting in is hard enough when you‚Äôre the new kid, but Auggie will have to work extra hard to get his classmates to look past his extraordinary face.
Wonder is overflowing with valuable messages for young readers: the importance of kindness, the value of empathy, the strength of friendship, the benefits of loyalty and courage, the ramifications of our actions, and that beauty is found on the inside.
Summer attends school with Auggie and sees that he‚Äôs ‚Äújust a kid.
Nonetheless, telling the story from multiple perspectives allows for another important message for young readers: people often appear fine on the surface but may be struggling internally and so deserve our kindness and consideration at all times.
Because the movie was so true to the book, I almost felt at times as if I‚Äôd already read it.
The stares and the ridicule and the bullying get pushed to another level, as Auggie sets out for school for the first time in his life when his parents opt for middle school over home schooling.
It‚Äôs a sad and uplifting story and I wish I could be less skeptical that things will be better for all children who are different, who are bullied.
If you have young children, give them this book to read or at the very least take them to see the movie.
My former high school librarian recommended this book to me when it came out.
Always trust a librarian.
It‚Äôs so full of human emotions ‚Äì kindness, love, courage, determination, fear ‚Äì and so full of beautiful messages.August Pullman is a wonderful boy.
But he is facially deformed, which makes it psychologically challenging for him to go out, let alone attend school.
But his mom thinks it‚Äôs time for him to stop being homeschooled.
At school, he makes friends who help him feel like he belongs and enemies who remind him that he will never be a normal kid.

"When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."
‚Äùthe only reason I‚Äôm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.‚Äù August Pullman has seen more, been through more at the somewhat tender age of ten than most people go through in an entire lifetime. Twenty-seven surgeries, surgeries to correct craniofacial deviations from what is considered normal, and yet strangers still gawk, people are rude and hurtful. Most of his life has been fairly sheltered, but soon he is about to face the challenge of attending schools, with other kids his age.
‚ÄúShall we make a new rules of life‚Ä¶ always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary?‚Äù
‚Äù‚ÄôKinder than is necessary,‚Äô he repeated, ‚ÄôWhat a marvelous line, isn‚Äôt it?
necessary
. Because it‚Äôs not enough to be kind.
It‚Äôs like I was saying just before: it‚Äôs not like measuring how much you‚Äôve grown in a year.
being kind, anyway?‚Äù
I have been meaning to borrow this back for a while, but instead‚Ä¶ after waiting however many years it has been since this book was first released, I finally just got a copy from my library.
