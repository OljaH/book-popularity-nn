A solid gripping story, heartfelt and beautifully written and good physcholical thriller that kept me turning the pagesThis is also know as The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes.Every now and then I enjoy a Diane chamberlain novel and this one really did hold my interest.
Diane Chamberlain’s novel “The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes” gives us the story of a teenage mother and her child.
But CeeCee is starving for love and naïve as only a 16 year old can be.
Thus begins the live of Eve, formerly CeeCee.Eve lives as a single mother and eventually loves and marries.
To do nothing will destroy her.As I read this story, I found myself trying to think of what I would have done if I were CeeCee. Lured into something she would never have considered…except for love.
“the Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes” is about motherhood and mothers.
Wow, I could not put this book down! This book would make a great movie. I can't wait to read others by Diane Chamberlain!
The awkward and embarrassing writing and the gratuitous and entirely off-putting "romance?" Could it be that the mix of all of these is what makes the whole so toxic?The book starts with the late afternoon lovemaking of the presumably agoraphobic Corinne and her fiance of five years, Ken. Corinne wants to tell Ken her "big news"--she drove on a freeway today!
Within seconds, dental records confirm it is the governor's wife, missing these 30 years.
Plus, the governor is easily manipulated into giving up his quest for vengance--carefully raised and nurtured all the years his wife was missing--after a 45 second conversation with Cory.
Most of the time I end up being disappointed because the hype doesn’t actually match the quality of the book.
All she wanted was to be loved again.The letters of love and advice from CeeCee's mom throughout the book was really touching and it gave great knowledge to CeeCee’s mother.The love that Eve and Cory had was amazing.
It had great: strong female role models, well developed characters and a lot of life lessons (without making you realize it).I am so glad this book was picked for me because to top it all off, it is also my S book for the A-Z challenge.
Overall, a really great book.
Despite the gumption she often showed as a teenager, with all of her big plans, I really believed that CeeCee was still naieve enough to succumb to Tim's charms.
My one criticism is in the character development of Cory during the last quarter of the novel.
CeeCee/Eve was incredibly fleshed-out as a character, but I found Cory a bit lacking.
Then, I didn't really believe Cory's inital reaction to the revelation that she was Russell's daughter.
She got to the "Will they accept me?" question far too quickly.Still, a pretty fantastic book!
CeeCee never knew who her father was, and after spending the past four years of her life in various foster homes, CeeCee finds herself working as a waitress in order to save money to eventually go to college.
CeeCee can never stop looking over her shoulder as she finds herself having to live a life riddled with lies to try to hide her past crime.
The novel follows CeeCee throughout 30 years of her life and I found it interesting how CeeCee changed over the course of the story.
I really enjoyed this novel and I look forward to reading more of this author's books in the future!
Tim Gleason was 12 years older than her and quickly had CeeCee wrapped around his finger.
A scheme to kidnap the Governor's wife goes horribly wrong and CeeCee makes a decision that will impact everyone's future.
I struggled to believe that Cory would completely abandon her family to fall for Ken- didn't seem realistic to me, and while I appreciated the ending, I also felt rushed through it all, and it didn't feel quite as legitimate as the rest of the book was.One thing is certain: I will be reading more by Ms. Chamberlain!
I loved this book. It was so hard to put down. If I had not needed sleep, I would have read it in one sitting.
This is my 5th book by Diane Chamberlain and once again, I love another one of her books. She drew me in from the very first page to the very last page and I could not put it down! 5 stars!!
Not sure if I can finish this book with so many idiots in it.Update May 17 2012: Well, I nearly quit reading this book after what I wrote above.Glad I sticked with it, only because there were so many raving reviews.What I do not like: The story is crazy, very unrealistic: Especially the kidnapping.
Normally the main character is the best mum on the planet.I liked the mental illnesses that were in this book.I am not done yet.
I think this is a book I would consider a beach read.
3.5 stars for me. This was a pretty good "what if" book. A young girl who has not had a proper bringing up, is duped into doing something for love that changes many lives. It's hard to pick a side of right or wrong in this one and it's hard not to say too much without revealing the plot. Good writing and good narrative.
WOW! Talk about an emotional read. It was fantastic. OK, you have to suspend the disbelief a bit but, it's fiction.   In 1977, pregnant Genevieve Russell disappeared.

WOW!

Any author who quotes or mentions Springsteen is a winner for me.
I reluctantly abandoned this book at about 60% as it’d become a chore rather than a pleasure to read. It felt very long – like I’d been reading it for months and, apart from events at the beginning of the book which had been pretty much flagged up in the blurb, nothing much seemed to happen. I guess it’s a story about relationships but, aside from the letters from the mother to her child(which I enjoyed) I found the relationships pretty dull. And the bits about SCAPE seemed far-fetched. It just didn’t work for me.

"She couldn't concentrate on making love."  My Thoughts on The Lost Daughter by Diane Chamberlain: In some ways this is a very typical Diane Chamberlain book.
In other ways, I remember what it was like to be sixteen and in love for the first time and how much you just want to please that person.
Generously rounding up to 3 StarsUnpopular opinion.....I struggled though this one. All the primary characters I disliked, making one bad decision after the next. I couldn’t find sympathy...ugh. BUT...this will not deter me from Chamberlain’s books. I have loved all the others.
WHEW! 500 pages of non-stop reading enjoyment with lots of suspense to boot! The letters of love and advice from CeeCee's mom throughout the book really added to my reading experience. I look forward to reading more books by Diane Chamberlain, The Midwife's Confession next.
This was one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a book and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride! At times I couldn’t quite believe what I was reading because it was such an out of this world, unexpected twist. I thought it was expertly written and in a way that actually made you sympathize and agree with certain characters crazy views. I also really enjoyed the ending, it all worked out in such a satisfying way!
"Twenty-eight years ago a North Carolina governor's young, pregnant wife was kidnapped.
Only one person -- CeeCee Wilkes -- can refute the charges against him.
But CeeCee disappeared years ago .
. ." (from summary on goodreads.com)I thought the young naive CeeCee was a believable character.
I understood how although CeeCee is a very smart young woman that she fell for Tim and the story he told her.
I really enjoyed the character development of her throughout the book.
It was an easy read because it pulled me into the story right away from those first pages.
It is a book that I would read again.
Am I ever so glad I picked up this book, in Kroger and started reading it.
Genetics are a smaller part of who we grow up to be, and possibly more superficial - hair & eye color and such.I actually got chills while reading this book towards the end.
My grandma read it before I did, and I really liked how we were able to talk about it.
She enjoyed the book as well, and was eager for me to read it.
I hope we can read more books and talk about them like we did this one.
I have been a fan of Diane Chamberlain's writing since I read the first book when I was living in Alexandria, Virginia. At that time, she had a private psychotherapy practice in Alexandria, and I am always interested in local authors. Chamberlain's books usually involve phobias, problems in personal relationships or some psychological issue, no doubt because of her background in psychotherapy.This is a heart wrenching story of the consequences of youthful bad choices. The only issue I can take with it is that the conclusion seems somewhat implausible. I don't want to include spoilers here, so...read it and see.
After reading The Midwife's Confession, I couldn't wait to get started on another book by Diane Chaimberlain. It took me a while to get into this story, but once I was hooked, I simply HAD to finish it and stayed up until way after midnight to do so. The story does require you to suspend your disbelief to a certain degree, but I had no problem doing so. Chaimberlain's writing reminds me of Jodi Picoult's and I'm already looking forward to the next one. Good thing she's written a few!
This book is much more made-for-tv-movie than my usual reading choices, but I had no trouble getting caught up in CeeCee's story. It's fast paced and engaging, even if I don't want to believe any woman (even 16 year-olds) would be gullible enough to fall for the lines that ensnared CeeCee.
رمان «اعترافات تکاندهنده یک ماما» اثر دایان چمبرلین، نویسنده آمریکایی از جمله این کتابهاست که جنبههای روانی شخصیتها، روابط خانوادگی و رازهای درونی افراد بخشی از موضوعات رمان را تشکیل میدهد.در معرفی کتاب که در پشت جلد آن درج شده، میخوانیم: «آیا نامهای که اجازه خواندنش را ندارید میخوانید؟ آیا تمایل دارید از رازی سر به مهر آگاه شوید؟ یا اینکه ترجیح میدهید اشتباه یک زن تا ابد پوشیده بماند؟ تارا و امرسون پس از خودکشی صمیمیترین دوستشان، نوئل، نامهای ناتمام را در میان وسایل شخصی او پیدا میکنند. آنها آن
نوئل دوستی بسیار عزیز برای آنها بود و خودکشی‌اش هر دوی آنها را در بهت و اندوه فرو برد اما راز سر به مهرش زندگی آنها را ویران کرد...»دایان	چمبرلین، نویسنده آمریکایی در اغلب رمان‌هایش بر روابط انسانی تمرکز دارد و در بسیاری از مواقع درباره ارتباطات و پیچیدگی‌های روانشناختی اعضای یک خانواده می‌نویسد.
اگر دلش می‌خواست، می‌توانست تمام شب همان جا بنشیند.دستش را بلند کرد و با انگشت دور قرص ماه دایره‌ای کشید.
او همان شب در حالی که زیر لب آوازی را زمزمه می‌کرد و در عین حال برای سالادش کرفس و خیار و گوجه‌فرنگی خرد می‌کرد، یاد آن نوزاد مو طلایی افتاد که روز قبل متولد شده بود - یک زندگی کوچک و ظریفی که از او کمک می‌خواست.
This book has been on my TBR list for years.
I've read more than a few of this author's books.
She hovers between 2 and 3 stars for me.
One book was 4 stars.I liked that this was told in third person.
That worked well for the story, even though it opens the flood gates of heavy narration (which this author takes advantage of).
These seemed like random events/actions and weren't tied down to the story.
The characters weren't particularly likable.
Their actions were in contrast to what I was given to know.
So 2 stars.
Just continuing my DC binge! 🙌
This was a roller coaster read with lots of social aspects to consider. Diane Chamberlain really drew me in and gave empathy to all sides of the story. The book didn't feel as lengthy as it actually was and the pacing of the story was good. The characters were mostly well developed though I felt Cory had some holes in her development timeline. Overall, an engaging read that was worth the time.
This book was a slow starter, but as the story progressed, it got more and more gripping and engaging.CeeCee Wilkes is 16.
CeeCee is so in love that she assists in this illegal plan, which involves kidnapping the governor's wife so that the governor will commute the sister's sentence.I got so involved in this book that I started to have anxious feelings about what was happening.
I've never read a book with this type of story line, so I was greatly entertained.I listened to the audio beautifully narrated by Cris Dukehart.4 stars
Jack is an unbelievably good man.
