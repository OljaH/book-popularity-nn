Very good and covered many interesting topics such as schizophrenia and dopplegangers as well as ghosts. Very interesting stories are noted throughout the book.Carrie A. Watson
I didn't get very far into it, but the author spent much of his time talking about mentally ill people instead of ghosts. Not what I was looking for.
(Of course, my pro-science bias is showing.) I expected more of a folk tale compendium, but this is more about premonition, astral projection, and other parlour science popular at the time.

Made it 18% in before quitting, it just isn't what I expected. The totality of, at least the early chapters, is about split personalities, all told from a late 19th century perspective - the point being that we are vessels for multiple souls. I suspect this is a build-up to actual ghost stories, but I was hoping to jump right into the scary stuff.

Split personalities are explained in psychiatry, and premonitions certainly does not involve ghosts. The third part however talked about some apparitions, but I didn't find them convincing enough.
