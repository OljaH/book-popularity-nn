I had attempted to read this book a couple of weeks ago, but I wasn't feeling it and gave up after 40 pages. Man, am I happy that I gave it a second chance! This was so dang cute and surprisingly not cheesy despite the plot sounding like a total cheese-fest. I love how this wasn't just an adorable slow-building romance, but it also follows Lincoln and his difficulties with growing up and moving on. Definitely read this if you are a fan of Rainbow Rowell's other novels or romantic comedies!
This is an especially appropriate metaphor to be making when talking about Rainbow Rowell‚Äôs delightful little book, Attachments, which is about a man falling in love in a very inappropriate way.
and it‚Äôs the middle of the night and I‚ÄôM SO ALONE.‚ÄùI believe that sentence and my five star rating should speak for itself, but I would like to elaborate anyway because when you fall in love with something you want to tell everybody about it as loudly and in as many ways as possible.Attachments takes place in 1999, just before the turn of the millennium and all the madness of Y2K (remember Y2K?
welcome to the 90's.Obviously, this is not the funnest job in the world; which is how Lincoln ends up amusing himself by reading the explicit emails between coworkers and friends, Beth & Jennifer.Jennifer is infinitely terrified of getting pregnant, yet she possibly wants to since Mitch, her husband, wants a baby.
Lincoln falls for Beth through the emails she sends to Jen, although he's never met her.
We follow the characters through their pathetic lives and how they all get over themselves, grow some balls and make life changing decisions...
I did enjoy Beth and Jen's emails.
Brilliant! I loved everything about it, definitely a new favorite. <3
But then, Beth and Jennifer's email chains get flagged in his security filters and Lincoln is immediately drawn to their infectious personalities.
Instead of sending them a warning letter as dictated by company policy, Lincoln continues to read the emails and quickly becomes invested in their lives, unable to resist the bright spot they create in his otherwise tedious, mind-numbingly boring job.
But my favorite part of this book by far (besides the swoonage of course) was Beth and Jennifer's relationship.
This was such a good book! It's one of those books that just makes you feel ridiculously happy. I'm glad that booksplosion chose it as the book of the month for May!
It definitely features some iffy stereotypes at times, but I still can‚Äôt help but to get the warmest of fuzzies every single time I read this book.
Lincoln is the cutest and I just die every time üòçReread 11/3/17: Re-read this for TBT this month and I mean is anyone at all surprised that I still adored this?
Look out for my TBT video going up next week to hear more in depth thoughts!Reread 9/26/16: Re-read this and I definitely still love this book more than I love any other book.
Lincoln is the fictional love of my life.
Definitely my favorite contemporary book of all time.
This romance contemporary was creepy. Not cute. It felt like I was reading YA, not Adult and it was literally one step away from You by Caroline Kepnes. The main character is basically described as a ‚Äúloser‚Äù. He's 28, plays D&D, has no social skills, lives with his mom and has never gotten over his high school sweetheart... BUT WAIT he‚Äôs actually tall, muscular, hot and has multiple degrees!!!! Right.I honestly don‚Äôt understand the hype. With a few changes it could have easily been a thriller/horror book!
I AM GUSHING FROM THE CUTENESS
When he starts getting flagged emails between Beth and Jennifer, he knows he should send them a warning and move on, but he can't seem to bring himself to do it.
Told from a third-person perspective with Lincoln at center stage, we only get to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails to each other.
I felt like I really got to know Beth and Jennifer through their emails, and for the first time in too long, I can actually understand why the male protagonist fell in love with the female.
Beth and Jennifer are genuinely good people, devoted friends, and beautifully flawed individuals.
i am looking at all the positive ratings and reviews people gave this book and only have one thought which is what the fuck.this is the creepiest and the most disturbing book i've read in years.
there is the main character (Lincoln) who falls in love w/ this woman (Beth) while reading her e-mails to her bestfriend.
later he decides to never send the warning because these girls are so wholesome BUT HE NEVER STOPS READING THE EMAILS.basically he learns a lot of stuff about Beth and falls in love with her.
i still think it would make more sense if the main character killed the girl or something because it reads EXACTLY like serial killer origin.moreover:
All of Rainbow Rowell's books are adorable and amazing and funny and this is no exception! I think Fangirl is still my favorite of her books, but I loved Attachments a little bit more than E&P. VERY EXCITED FOR LANDLINE!
Many may disagree but I think the premise of this novel is completely original and IMO, the most creative plot yet in the four books of Ms. Rowell I have already read.
He lands a most unrewarding job, an internet security for a newspaper company and has to read to censure inappropriate e-messages sent by employees but instead of reproaching Jennifer and Beth for sending hilarious personal e-mails to each other, he starts enjoying their stories and here begins the cutest story/ies, some of which will end up being romantic but totally ship-worhty !
The authenticity of their situation and dialogues that perfectly harmonize with the story‚Äôs setting made the novel completely adorable.
I wish I was funny enough to make that up.Anyway, at the beginning of the book, Lincoln is still in love with his high school girlfriend, lives with his mom, has no social encounters but for Dungeons & Dragons games, and works nights reading people‚Äôs emails at a newspaper.
I‚Äôm officially now the funniest person on Earth.) Anyway, instead of sending Beth a warning message, or at least not reading her mail anymore, Lincoln keeps on keepin‚Äô on (all up in that inbox).

As the only dude to win this book from Goodreads' First-Reads I feel a bit o' pressure.
I liked this book a lot.
Plot- Lincoln's the guy who monitors email at his work.
Over the course of the book we learn: Beth has a Sandman poster, She quotes Field of Dreams deeper than "If you build it", She made a LOTR reference that I didn't catch, She referenced The movie Heathers, and had an astute observation on Julia Roberts[(Chap 9- page 38ish)at this point I was fully hooked].
Rainbow Rowell has a gift for writing beautiful and unconventional love stories.
"Attachments" follows a shy, socially-awkward, (he loves playing Dungeon & Dragons) deeply insecure 28 year-old named Lincoln.
Lincoln still loves at home with his mom, and works at a job he absolutely despises (his job is to read/filter his co-workers emails).
Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that Lincoln grows tremendously though out the course of this novel.
Rowell's writing and sense of humor is simple and refreshing but never feels flat or monotone.
I've written popular novels for young adults and regular adults as well like Eleanor and Park, Fangirl....**Justin to Rainbow** ...Landline, Carry On, yeah yeah yeah.
Are guys even supposed to be reading this stuff?**Rainbow to Justin** Justin, everyone is supposed to read my books, and everyone IS reading my books except you.
What makes you so special?**Justin to Rainbow** You know, I was just scrolling through my Overdrive app and your first book is available right now.
**Rainbow to Justin** That's my first book, Attachments.
You already have one thing in common with my protagonist, Lincoln.............................................**Justin to Rainbow** Sorry I've been away for a few days.
There‚Äôs nothing you could become that I haven‚Äôt already fallen in love with.‚ÄùIt's always fun reading Rainbow Rowell's books.
It's not, that her novels are extraordinary or incredibly good (apart from  Fangirl  that is), but Rowell always makes me feel comfortable and cozy.
That's the reason I love her books so much.
I think this is one of the main things that make this novel(or all of them) so lovely.The one thing that bothered me is that it took Lincoln and Beth so (sooooooooooo) long to meet.
Enough said.Find more of my books on Instagram
They're really people with unique quirks and imperfections and beauty and it's so easy to be sucked into reading her books because I feel like I actually know these people!This book, particularly, was cute and lovely.
I thought the mails back and forth were hilarious and adorable and I thought that Lincoln''s maturing was really well done.
The reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because I really wanted Lincoln and Beth to meet earlier ..
I don't feel that I got enough cute time between the two of them!
Throughout the story, we get to read email correspondence between best friends Beth and Jennifer as well as read all about Lincoln, the IT guy hired to read company emails flagged for inappropriate use.
I, too, was working for a newspaper around that time and email was a relatively new thing in the workplace.
I have to specially call out to a secondary character in the book, Justin (Lincoln's friend), who stole every scene he was in with his foul language and over the top attitude:
It's such a feel-good book!!

If I hadn't listened to this on audiobook, there's no way I would have been able to finish it.
I literally fell asleep twice while listening to this and missed about 5 chapters, but I couldn't be bothered to rewind and listen to what I missed.
The entire premise is creepy and voyeuristic, and I didn't agree with their relationship.
I love Rainbow's writing, but this one was my least favorite of hers.
It definitely doesn't compare to her newer releases.
Overall, I did not enjoy this very much at all, but it did provide a twinge of humor and lighthearted dialogue.
4.25 starsI really enjoyed it! It's not my favorite of Rainbow Rowell's books but it had her same flair and addicting story.I loved Lincoln! He's definitely on my list of favorite male protagonists. The only problem I had with it was the pacing. The middle dragged quite a bit, but by the time I got to the end I felt things were wrapped up very well.Overall, I definitely recommend checking out this book. Especially, if you love any of Rainbow's other books. :)
‚ÄúRight.‚Äù‚ÄúWell, when you think about that guy‚Äîwho, by the way, we both know isn‚Äôt me‚Äîwhen you thinkabout meeting him, do you think about meeting him in a place like this?
The girls all looked like they were listening to the same sad story.
I hated feeling like there was this major part of your life that we couldn‚Äôt talk about.That said, I don‚Äôt think you ever have to worry about me running away with or making a drunken pass at Chris.
(c)Q:‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know someone could love me like this,‚Äù she said.
I would now say that Attachments has taken the top spot for my favourite Rowell novel - I enjoyed it immensely and have since recommended it to many of my friends.- So this story follows a guy named Lincoln who works in IT - Lincoln's job is to monitor the emails of all of the employees at his workplace (he also works at night - ha).
Not long into the job the emails of two women in particular keep getting flagged by the system, so when an email gets flagged it is Lincoln's job to read it and send a warning (employees are not meant to use their work emails for personal conversations).
2017: Yep, still perfection.
I love it more than I could say.
This was just perfection.
I adored the premise and the format it was written in was phenomenal.
I LOVED that we got into Lincoln's head and only knew Beth and Jennifer in the same way Lincoln did.Beth is the sort of friend I want to have.
I want to hang out and get drunk and probably arrested with her.
She's smart as hell, quick with a comeback and hilarious.
Lincoln is sweet and every descriptive word that Beth and Jennifer use for him is correct.
Either way, it was still a good ‚ÄúValentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù read and I‚Äôm glad Rainbow Rowell didn‚Äôt disappoint, once again.The beginning was sort of difficult to get into.
Jennifer and Beth were just hilarious and oh-so real.Overall, I like how once Beth found out Lincoln had been reading her e-mails (and had undoubtedly told Jennifer), and Jennifer had been super against it and had wanted to turn him in.
That made this novel more realistic than it already was, because that would‚Äôve been me - so I like how Rowell made her characters believable and didn‚Äôt make them all agree with one another.
Beth has beens been living with her hot but somewhat antisocial boyfriend Chris for years; Jennifer is married and worried about whether to start a family.
Since Beth and Jennifer regularly use those kinds of words in their emails, he starts reading their exchanges.
Instead of warning them to stop, like he's supposed to, he gets sucked into their lives and starts falling for Beth, even though he has no idea what she looks like.About half of the book is done in email exchanges, like this:Jennifer to Beth: Has Chris seen your shoulders?
While entertaining, this novel lacked a lot. It seemed too easy and even though the main character was believable as a good guy, he was not someone anybody would want to date or be friends with. I appreciated the reality that was felt when the emails printed but had a much better time with The Sorrows of Young Mike which printed instant messenger conversations between people who I liked. John Zelazny built an awesome take on modern epistolary fiction when he parodied The Sorrows of Young Werther.
