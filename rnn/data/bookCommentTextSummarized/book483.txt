Thayer does the great man justice in his elegantly written biography.
Roosevelt is described with such passion, which no doubt he inspired in many, and eloquence that you feel personally affected by his story (view spoiler)[and death (hide spoiler)].
Thankfully he does not go into too much detail of the politics; instead neatly summarises them, and leads with enlightening and exciting stories.
The missing star is my greedy response to wanting even more of these tales!
This book is sure to influence you to try and be more honest, industrious, and idealistic like 'The Great American' did to many in his day.
Interesting but somewhat biasedThayer does not try to hide that he was a close friend of Roosevelt (though they apparently did have some political differences). Thus, this book presents Roosevelt as a gigantic, Promethean figure in American life and letters. Don't read it for a balanced view of the man. Read it for its passionate intensity and advocacy. The final chapters on Roosevelt's post-presidency are especially compelling.
Really enjoyed this especially in contrast to two newly published book reviews where he's called a "war loving martinet". I think if it weren't for T Roosevelt, we'd all be speaking German today.
