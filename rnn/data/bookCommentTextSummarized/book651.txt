This interlude follows the second book of the Forsyte saga. Mercifully short since it was so sugary it might have given me indigestion. Maybe the little info that it contains is important for the third volume. We'll see.
This short story is an absolute charmer. It’s a beautiful interlude within the larger story, and an even more beautiful glimpse into those enchanted days of early childhood. Simply gorgeous.

I'm pretty sure the first time I read the Forsyte Chronicles, I skipped over this little gem. Last night, I read it with a whole new appreciation, because now I am a mother to a precocious little boy.
Not rally a whole book. More of an interlude of about a few dozen pages.Cute, but tacky a bit.No male can not love Irene. At some point it will get annoying.
Sweet little story of little Joylon's lovely childhood. It really works well in juxtaposition to the first interlude story of Old Joylon.
The first two trilogies have interconnecting interludes between each of their two parts...............................................................................................................................................The Forsyte Saga:-The Forsyte Saga was not planned as such but developed over years with sequels coming naturally as they did, and human heart and passion and minds within settings of high society of a Victorian and post Victorian England - chiefly London - and its solid base in property.When it was published it was revolutionary in the theme - a woman is not owned by her husband, and love is not a duty she owes but a bond that is very real however intangible, that cannot be faked.Wednesday, September 10, 2008........................................................................
A nice interlude, but not my favorite section of the series. Strictly a matter of personal preference. The older, stodgier Forsytes are so much more fun.
Маленький рассказ, но так трогает за самое сердце. Сила детской любви к матери. Любовь матери к ребенку. Прекрасно!
This was much shorter than expected
