Unfortunately it all backfires, and the two of them spend most of the rest of the book at cross purposes, trying to make each other jealous, saying hurtful things they don't really mean, and other types of nonsense like that.I did like Philip as a main character (except when he got a little too carried away with the high fashion routine) but Cleone was one of those silly heroines who acts like an idiot too often for me.
This is the third book GH wrote & she completed it in an incredible three weeks! I've always been all over the place with this novel.There are a lot of things I like about it but the assertion by the author that woman want to be mastered (um, no we don't!) And until I read the (awful)   I thought this was GH's least likeable heroine & that Philip (one of GH's "sweet" heroes) really deserved better.But I've now been married a life time over thirty years to a lovely fellow who takes no int
A lot of readers complain about Heyer (born 1902) spraying some of her books with French phrases.
Previous readings of both this book & Madam de Pompadour it was never a problem for me, as I took French in High School.
(but I did struggle reading Madame de Pompadour!)I love the quite beautiful descriptions of the clothing - probably the most detailed description of men's clothing in any of GH's Georgian novels.
& I do think Philip's French friends would have been a lot of fun to hang out with.A member of the Georgette Heyer Fans Group (HJ) found the original ending (an extra chapter) to this book on a blog.http://www.shelaghlewins.com/other_st...
However, by the time I got fed up enough with it to actually stop reading, it lacked only a few chapters to finish, so WTH.I suppose having a good majority of the book in French might possibly have something to do with my dislike of the novel.
I started off really liking this book as I'm a huge fan of Georgette Heyer.
However, once he married he settled down and after his wife died brought up his son to be a good and honest man.Philip loves Cleone.
Maurice, his father and Cleone goad him, more or less, until he goes to Paris to become the man they both think he should be and that they want.I'm glad to say it backfires on them both.How well he played them both.
It is not on a par with any of her other books and I doubt I'll ever read it again.
I think the saving grace for this book was that it was a short read. Once again I am addicted to the over the top, melodramatic language of the era and the pleasure it brings me is why I will always come back to the genre! It is what I enjoyed here as well. However, there was something missing from the story, albeit it was better than the first book, The Black Moth. This is the second book by this author and it shows signs of her greatness to come...
This book, sweet, short, hilarious, with its oh-so-French flair was completed in one sitting.The book is about Philip Jettan, son to the extravagant Maurice and nephew of Tom. The latter are both highly fashionable men, who are well known in high society; whereas the good-natured, but somewhat simpleton and rough-on-the-edges Philip, leaves much to be desired.Philip is, however, the loving flame of Cleone, a neighborhood friend and great beauty.
He’s got style, class, fashion…and, a way with words that makes every woman want to be with him.When he comes back to England, he is a changed man.
But Philip wants to know if Cleone really loves the man, or the powder.
I was actually more forgiving of her at the beginning of the book, because to a certain degree, I kind of understood her desire for Philip to be more "polished." I considered it as a product of her society back then.
In that vein, I don't really fault Cleone; it's what she did halfway through the book that annoyed me.
When Philip proposed to her a second time, she got angry at him for being a flirt in Paris.
Weren't you blatantly flirting with Henry in front of Philip before?
This early novel is set in the Georgian period, as Heyer discovers wit and plays around with it. I strongly suspect that she had been reading Pelham as well as a great deal of eighteenth century novels, as she gives us a young country hero whose beloved rejects him because he has no polish. So he sets out to become the most polished of beaux . . . and teach her a lesson.
I loved this cute little book.
Girl wants more than what he is, guy wants to change for her.
Guy changes but only because he wants to impress her.
Girl sees guy and realizes that she always wanted that was right in front of her.
Guy pretends to be the guy she wants, girl becomes sad.
The reason why I'm ranking it down two stars is that it was too darn short and simple.
So, go in expecting a cute but short story and not one of Heyer's normal tales and you have this book.
"Powder and Patch" is simply hilarious!
This was my second Heyer novel, after "The Black Moth" and I think I enjoyed it even more!
The humour in there is just flagrant; the way Heyer satires the Polite Society and the high classes is simply genially and hilariously done!
I enjoyed this novel from beginning to end, loving the hero Philip and wanting to slap Cleone many times.
I understand how some people say that the characters are plainly annoying, I guess it all depends on what mood you're in when you read it...You either find them ridiculously annoying or ridiculously funny...I went with funny and thought "Powder and Patch" to be delightful!
Not one of the first-rate ones. Very problematic. Pre-makeover Philip is sufficiently sullen and immature that the makeover into a silver-tongued devil isn't very convincing. Cleone never has a single likeable moment; a sensible man would have forgotten her as soon as he met an interesting woman. (You can tell the author senses this, because the preface makes such a big deal of "for us Jettans, there is always only one great love.")The scene in which Cleone accidentally gets engaged to two men is funny, and Philip's cleaning up after is mildly amusing.
His father, the dashing Sir Maurice, wants him to wed Cleone and agrees he must change to win her heart - a double betrayal of the two people Philip loves most!He reluctantly heads off to London and then Paris, to endure what would be a comical movie montage nowadays of fittings, fencing and French lessons; it is funny, but a bit drawn out with a great deal of untranslated French thrown in which kind of breaks up the flow a bit.
Of course he eventually heads home to London to show up Cleone and his father and it is satisfying, funny and charming in parts, but pretty predictable.
This Georgian era set novel is one of Georgette Heyer's earliest works published as "The Transformation of Philip Jettan" under the pseudonym Stella Martin.
I would not have wanted to attach my name to this work either if I were her.
This is possibly her worst novel ever.
It's a classic misunderstanding plot that works fine in short stories.
Most of the novel is dedicated to the transformation of Philip and even that is greatly rushed.
The heroine is one of the worst sorts who flirts and gets angry at the man she loves for no good reason.
Most of Heyer's other heroines are not so awful.
My 17th Georgette Heyer The question is as old as time: do you want a good guy or the bad boy?Philip Jettan, a handsome and sturdy but tongue-tied youth, is rejected by his true love because he is a country-bumpkin so he travels to Paris is become an accomplished flirt and a fashion sensation.
Upon returning to England, he decides to take a little revenge on his beloved Cleone, but things go awry.The book overflows with description of clothing, it concerns itself with the games played between courting couples, but there is a prevalent notion that young women need to be mastered by their lovers.
There isn't any character growth for either Philip or Cleone, only misunderstandings and duels.
"Georgette Heyer and Jamie Glover are an excellent mix!"Overall *****Performance *****Story *****Jamie Glover does a fantastic job with the voices! Loved it! I was reticent when I began thinking that if this wasn't read well, it would be an extremely dull four hours. But this narrator did excellent, I can't imagine anyone else doing better for this particular Heyer, which is one of my favorites. It's witty and fast paced, I'll want to listen to this again!
I was not entertained.STORY BRIEF:Phillip is happy with his simple life as a country farmer.
Phillip and Cleone love each other.
Cleone tells Phillip she wants him to gain polish and to dress better.
Phillip goes to Paris to transform himself.
When Phillip goes to Paris we don’t see the transformation process which I would have liked.
For example, he loves her but he acts like he doesn’t – because he wants to test her or teach her a lesson.Cleone was finicky, scatterbrained, stupid, shallow, and irritating.
Apparently Cleone could believe two opposing ideas and wanted Phillip to “master her” into the right decisions.
If you are a fan of Jane Austen and haven't read Miss Heyer yet then what are you waiting for.Cleone Charteris is a young lady of fine manners and undeniable beauty.
He is strong, honest and so sure that his dear love Cleone will accept him as he is that upon his asking for her hand in marriage he is devastated when she refuses because he is a plain country bumpkin instead of a painted popinjay.Our author writes her stories with a purity of heart and soul that is nothing short of a breath of fresh air.
Philip Jettan, the main character, is in love with a girl named Cleone, but she tells him she doesn't want him until he learns a bit more address; Philip disdains the frippery of the fashionable world.
After a young man who does have the address Philip lacks pays court to Cleone, Philip hies himself to France to learn how to be a fashionable gentleman.
I can usually gloss over that bit, but in Powder and Patch, almost the entire last third of the book involves characters discoursing on how foolish women are and how Philip should use anything but frankness and reason to attempt to gain Cleone's hand in marriage.

Powder and Patch is a lighter piece of fluff for Georgette Heyer, and much shorter in length than the majority of her novels.
Here is the synopsis:The charm of Powder and Patch, as with many of Heyer's other novels, is her discourse on the social customs of the time, revealed through character exchanges and descriptions of dress and mannerisms for both ladies and gentleman.
Of course, what constitutes a gentleman has changed from era to era, in the Georgian period gentlemen must have great "love making" technique, have a certain air and posture, be a wonderful dancer, have a sly wit and, of course, must have great swordsmanship for all those duels to defend "my lady's" honour.
Well written, of coarse it's Georgette Heyer.
I strongly disliked Cleone, the love interest of the main character Philip.
I hate it when the object of a man's affections has nothing to recommend her except her beauty.
Not all women can or should be like Jane Eyre, but they should be something more than just nice to look at, she could at least have been kind.I liked Philip better before he changed, he was much more manly and attractive sounding.
man.
I will try again with Georgette Heyer, maybe the next one will have more likable characters.
This book was better than Georgette Heyer's first book The Black Moth.
Phillip Jettan prefers the backwater of his life.
He is also enamored of a neighbor's daughter, Cleon Charteris.
Then Cleon meets man about town, Sir Henry Bancroft.
Now Phillip looks uncouth to her.
Hurt, after a mock duel in which he is bested, Phillip retreats to Paris.
Meeting Cleon some times later with him painted and patched, she barely recognizes him.
Now she is not so sure she likes this new version.Cleone is not so perfect herself and gets herself into a fine compromising situation!
Imagine The Scarlet Pimpernel minus the French revolution and any sense of adventure. You still have a masterful hero, but the plot doesn't last long. Phillip Jettan comes from a long line of bad boys. However, he just wants to live and work on the family farm! When his sweetheart spurns him for not having more town polish, he heads to France to learn polish. Upon returning, he presents the perfect gentleman...but is that what his beloved really wanted? Entertaining and brief, but a bit sexist. I like Phillip. Less enamored with Cleone. Still, an enjoyable, light read.
I'm not entirely sure what I think of this book.
It was a pretty fast read for me, a lot faster than I expected, actually.
other than the parts where Philip was in France.
With most books I read, I prefer to like the main characters.
I actually didn't like Philip or Cleone very much at all.
(Gosh, you can have the "new" Philip...
- lol)Still, though, it was a good book and I do plan to read some more books by this author.I haven't read Oscar Wilde in quite some time, but this book kept making me think of his plays.
The one star reviews make me a little sad, but I tend to understand them. However, while Cleone is certainly not my favourite Heyer heroine, I did enjoy the book for its sweet lightheartedness, and I also developed a little crush on Philip/Philippe. 5 years of school French under my belt came in handy, or my pleasure would have been crucially dimmed, I'm certain. So even if I usually prefer the Regency ones among Heyer's novels, this is definitely among my personal top ten. As no. 10. ;)
Georgette Heyer, I love you.
But Cleone does not appreciate Philip's good qualities - his reliability, sobriety and steadfastness.
Cleone is perhaps one of the silliest of Heyer's heroines but she is still delightful.
The book's main character is the charming Philip with his ability to laugh at himself and at the follies of the world.This novel is one of my favourites for its sheer light heartedness.
None of the characters are wholly bad or wholly good and people change over the course of the story.
If you have not read Heyer before this would be a good novel to start with.
If you haven't read a Heyer novel start off with this one as its shorter (about 200 pages) than her others novels and gets straight into the love conflict early on (not as slow as her other novels).
Cleone is a beautiful country woman who has an admirer Philip Jettan but he has not toured Europe or become a Gentleman as per her standards.
When Cleone makes it very clear that she can't marry a man who isn't, Philip is finally motivated to listen to his fathers encouragement to go stay with his uncle in London and learn how to become a Gentlemen.
This book is delightful. So funny and witty. The characters, dialogues, descriptions. There are all Heyer's components.You can tell that all goes around one idea, that:there’s naught under the sun so unreasonable as a maid in loveEven if you feel that that is unfair you will laugh. You will laugh also when you read what meant to be a fasionable gentleman in an 18th-Century England and France.This book is totally thoughtful.And don't forget about Philip's chin! ;-) [If you know what I mean ;-) ]
This was a fast, fun read that sported sword play, swooning and a young woman being chased by several young suitors and being engaged to all of them. I usually don't read romance but this one wasn't so painful as I thought it would be. The writing wasn't exactly my cup of tea but it didn't require much thought, something I think I need now and then between those big novels that I think I need to read!
