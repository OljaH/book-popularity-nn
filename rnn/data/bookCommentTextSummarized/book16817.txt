3.5 StarsThis was my least favorite of the series thus far, although I still enjoyed it.
Something was missing for me as far as the plot/suspense went.
It just didn't draw me in, keep me on the edge of my seat, as much as previous books.
Regardless, I of course enjoyed every moment between Roarke and Eve. And I appreciated the situation between Feeney and Eve too.
Their father/daughter dynamic in the face of all the things Eve went through with her real father is sweet and I loved how Roarke stepped in to mediate here.
Looking forward to the next one, as usual.
ROARKE! <3 Ladies, don't you ever forget his name. ;) For once, he slept first. She lay in the dark, listening to him breathe, stealing a little of his warmth as her own body cooled. Since he was asleep, she stroked his hair."I love you," she murmured. "I love you so much, I'm stupid about it."With a sigh, she settled down, closed her eyes, and willed her mind to empty.Beside her, Roarke smiled into the dark.He never slept first.  Ahhhh don't you see? He's so perfect... :) Ugh I'm crazy about
ROARKE!
<3 Ladies, don't you ever forget his name.
For once, he slept first.
She lay in the dark, listening to him breathe, stealing a little of his warmth as her own body cooled.
Since he was asleep, she stroked his hair."I love you," she murmured.
"I love you so much, I'm stupid about it."With a sigh, she settled down, closed her eyes, and willed her mind to empty.Beside her, Roarke smiled into the dark.He never slept first.
Ahhhh don't you see?
He's so perfect...
:) Ugh I'm crazy about him, I'm crazy about Eve and I'm so crazy every fucking thing about this series.
You see, Eve is supposed to be the very best cop in homicide and yet she ALWAYS - in every book - arrests or detains the wrong person at some point.
And, she OFTEN gets rescued by her billionaire husband, Roarke-not-a-cop.
(It's an English guy thing))But, assuming he never sees this review or any other, let me tell you more about Roarke, my dream-book-boyfriend.He's spiritual and gave Eve a wedding band that is engraved with Celtic symbol of protection.
Oh, and he's hot.le sigh...Yeah, he's topping my book-boyfriend list right now.
I will say the murder theme was intriguing but it was a tad bit gruesome.
While I would LOVE more time where Roarke and Eve are together I am finding that it doesn’t much matter anymore.
In the midst of all the crazy shit that goes on in Eve’s life as she tracks down the murderers, Roarke places himself in the middle as her silent (well sort of) protector.
Beyond Roarke and Eve, with each book we get more of the secondary characters.
There are few people in her life that she values and Feeney is one of them.
Her loyalties were torn – she could only use Peabody and Roarke, while reporting directly to Commander Whitney.
When Eve was confronted with Wiccans and Satanists, her disbelief and cynicism stood out.
Eve was determined to find the answers she needed to lay the case to rest…Ceremony in Death by J.D. Robb is a re-read for me, and brilliant as per usual.
With Eve and Roarke, Peabody and Summerset, the scene is set for another intense ride.
My enjoyment of the In Death series never wanes – a quick, entertaining read, Ceremony in Death is highly recommended.
Gripping as always, this instalment brought something new and exciting to the series. Is there or isn't there a place for a little supernatural in a world dominated by technology? My answer is a cautious "yes" but you may disagree and that's ok too. So far J.D. Robb did alright by me and as long as that continues In Death will have a place on my shelf. It doesn't hurt that I'm hopelessly in love with Roarke either ;)Over and out
Nothing.And after giving Eve something to think about with his little show of domination and power, it's back to sweet Roarke, ever the tender lover...
"I love you so much, I'm stupid about it."With a sigh, she settled down, closed her eyes, and willed her mind to empty.Beside her, Roarke smiled into the dark.He never slept first.”
A few I've noticed:-- Dog love-- Wiccan religion-- Love of all things Irish-- Cop speak - the woman writes a great woman copWiccans and magic are a big part of this book...along with some satanists, both of whom are on the suspect list for Eve's cop friend and the ensuing murders that take place.
As far as I am concerned J.D. Robb can do no wrong and this particular book is one of my special favourites.
Peabody and Eve are developing their beautiful relationship and their dialogue is brilliant.
Roarke and Eve continue to be very much in love and also have some delightful interchanges.
The police work is good, the element of mystery is always present and the ending is exciting and a bit scary.
Oh and of course the author makes us reach for the tissue box with some tear jerking moments.
Amend that to lots of tear jerking moments.
Another solid read. I love these two, Roarke and Eve - although maybe their "together" time is few and far between. Would like some more sexy times for the two of themI dip in every so often. I reckon if I read one a year I might be finished the series by the time I am 95!! The abused child from the mean streets of Dublin had done what he'd needed to do to survive.
I completly agree with My friend Jilly's review https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I'll just add that here the villain was really sick!
Loved this 5th book in J.D. Robb's "In Death" series!
I love this series so much. Sometimes the plots get so ridiculous that I laugh out loud, and yet the characters are so great, the rapport so wonderful, I can't help but want to take the ride with them, wherever it goes.

"Bu arada, Dallas?""Ne oldu, Peabody?""Bu çok güzel bir dövme.
Yeni mi?"Eve dişlerini tekrar sıktı, kapıya doğru olabildiğince asil bir şekilde yürüdü.
"Gördün mü?"Eve koridorda yürürken bir parmağını Roarke'ın göğsüne vurdu.
Gül goncası kişisel."Roarke gülerek kolunu Eve'in omzuna atıp ona sıkıca sarıldı.
Siz ne güzel bir çiftsiniz ya.
Konudan bahsetmeyeceğim çünkü spoilers ama bu kitap diğer dördüne oranla bir tık daha değişik olmuş bence.
Eğer polisiye ve aşk seviyorsanız bundan daha iyi bir seri bulamazsınız.
Bence seriyi güzel yapan da onlar.
Onlar olmasa sıradan bir polisiye olarak kalırdı.
Onlar bu polisiye maratonunu yapmasa daha elim gitmezdi.
★★★★★ This series just keeps getting better. Susan Ericksen is an excellent narrator and has developed the tone in the characters voices to perfection. She is so talented she can do Officer (Delia) Peabody with a cold, LOL! This one is about witches – both good and evil. And Captain (Ryan) Feeney and Homicide Detective Eve Dallas get into a doozey of a falling out. Can the relationship be mended? By the way, this one is Halloween Perfect, as they attend a Halloween Party in costume.
Another great installment in the series. I can't get enough of it!
The way she sneered at Peabody and Mira who actually had experience with Wiccans and were much more open minded deserved a slap in the face.Another reason why I disliked this book was Roarke.
Jesus!But the main reason why my dislike for this book turned into hatred was the way Eve handled Chas.
She wanted Chas to be guilty, she decided that he was guilty - even though it didn't make a lick of sense, but he was a Wiccan and his father was a murderer and that was enough for her - and she destroyed his self-respect, his peace of mind, his sanity.
When several other victims die in horrific circumstances, Eve finds herself embroiled in a conflict between opposing forces of good and evil that eventually leads her to a confrontation that may force her to play the ultimate price…The best installment so far both in terms of the investigation and the character development.The dichotomy between Good and Evil, and the symbolism of Wicca and Satanism, inherent in the case makes this one of the most intense and gripping mysteries in the series.
There are also some compelling insights into both Peabody and Feeney’s characters as they learn more about themselves and Eve as well.
I'm really enjoying this series now and getting to know the main characters - Eve, Peabody, Roarke, Mavis and Feeney and how they will behave and react.
Eve is thrust into the world of Wiccans and Satanists and must work out who she can trust.I love the way Peabody's character is developing.
Roarke is his usual hunky, sexy self, helping Eve out when she needs him and even when she says she doesn't.
Alice's younger brother Jamie was a welcome new edition and I hope we see more of him in future books.The plot is fast moving and keeps you guessing as to who the bad guy is as more bodies appear and the suspense is kept up until all is revealed in the final scene.
Roarke and Eve are a great couple but also love how they protect each with even thinking of it.
As much as Eve tries to believe that she doesn't have a family, she actually does with Roarke, Mavis, Feeney, Peabody, Mira and Nadine.
Meeting Roarke the sweet talking Irish love who by the way still keeps the button in his pocket and now has added the IOU is the best thing that's ever happen to Eve and I believe he will be the one to help get pass the horrors of her past and will always be her Knight and a lovely Irish Knight.
Yes, I love Roarke!
“I am a high priestess of the dark lord. Our numbers are legion, and I have powers that would make you weep.”   Eve Dallas faces off with a Satanic cult and ridiculous as it sounds it’s one of her toughest cases. Serious people don’t take magic, or Satanists, seriously... which works in their favor when they’re murderers.
I'm listening to this series in audiobook, because I've found that this narrator makes this world come alive for me.
That's one of the things I love about this series.
I may know who the villain is, but the fun is in watching Eve discover the reasons why.
I enjoyed the way Robb set up the case so that Eve would have to stand apart from Feeney on the case.
I really loved Roarke and Feeney in this one.But I can't forget about Peabody.
I enjoyed this book and thought the plot was interesting.
Not sure how many times I've read this book, but I still love it!
Since this time around I'm concentrating on more parts of my dream home, I have to point out the home gym.
I guess if you have a big gym you have to work out in a big way, like Eve does.
I'm using that because my home gym is smaller, so my workout is smaller.
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
Great excuses, I mean reasons, right?Reread April 2018–still loving this book.
People trying to understand Eve and all her pockets of anxiety.
Well this one was remarkably easy, you know right from the start who the villain is. It was still an entertaining book considering it dabbled in spirituals.
When a cop dies, it is up to Eve to investigate if there was anything untoward about his death (of course there is), and what follows is a fun romp through the world of satanism and the occult, while Eve sees out her investigation.
I'm pretty sure that cops are not meant to bring their spouses into their work lives as much as Roarke is involved in Eve's, but I suppose the author wants him in the story as much as possible.I always enjoy this series as a good palate cleanser between big, complicated books.
I liked that Robb showcased Eve as a nonbeliever in the slight paranormal twist to this book.
Then there’s Roarke who doesn’t hold the same opinions as Eve and is more open to the idea of magic.
Peabody doesn’t have that usual sparkle of mischief in this one because she is down with a cold, but her presence is still enjoyable.And then there’s Roarke whom I fall in love with more and more.
It seems that my list of favourite scenes with him grows with each passing book.I absolutely loved this scene: For once, he slept first.
Beside her, Roarke smiled into the dark.
As much as I appreciate a good paranormal book, this book left me suffering.Surrounded by witches, good and evil, Eve betrays a dear friend and puts the job first.This book really hits home with Eve. A suspect is the son of a serious psycho serial killer and rapist who worshipped satan.
The father raped and beat his own son.
It was a bit boring to me.I recommend this book to mature adults.
Strong sexual content.
Strong and intriguing violence.
why bother?Line of the book:“…my narcissism is balanced by a generous heart.”~Happy reading!
Now I know why this book is so addictive.I enjoyed it like I enjoyed the other four.
I Knew who was the killer from the very first part of the book, but the way J D Robb carried the whole thing out was great.I was really hurt when both Eve and Feeney was hurting.
They both were right from their own places, but they also handle the situation like they should.
I know Eve was investigating, but still, It didn't feel right.
It's just didn't feel right.I like the fact that they let go, Jaime.
When I read the first In Death book, I was optimistic, and thought that Nora Roberts could potentially turn it into a pretty good series.
Besides which, she writes about Roarke as if she thinks growing up in inner city Dublin was some kind of cross between Oliver Twist and an eleventh century myth.Perhaps the books following Naked in Death may have been more fun to read if Roberts had dragged out their relationship a little longer, but by book five the two are married and repeating the same tired old sex scenes every handful of chapters, leaving no room for further development.
4 1/2 stars
