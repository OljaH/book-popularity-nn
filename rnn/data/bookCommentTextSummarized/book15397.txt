Another adventure off to a good start. Prince Darren, along with Larten Crepsley and Harkat Mulds, are sent off on a special mission to hunt the Vampaneze Lord by Mr. Tiny. I really enjoy Darren as a main character. It will be interesting to see where the other takes things as the story progresses. As with the other stories in the series, the book is well written, and has no ending. I'll have to read the next book in the series to continue the plot started in this book. Which is one of my bigge
Prince Darren, along with Larten Crepsley and Harkat Mulds, are sent off on a special mission to hunt the Vampaneze Lord by Mr. Tiny.
As with the other stories in the series, the book is well written, and has no ending.
I'll have to read the next book in the series to continue the plot started in this book.
Which is one of my biggest annoyances about this series.

Book Two: The Vampire's Assistant 
Book Four: Vampire Mountain 
Book Six: The Vampire Prince
دارن شان، شاهزادهء اشباح، برای انجام ماموریتی کوهستان اشباح را ترک می کند که شاید منجر به مرگ او شود. او یکی از برگزیدگانی است که باید به تعقیب ارباب شبح واره ها برود. اگر او را نابود کند پیروز است و اگر شکست بخورد قبیلهء اشباح را به کام مرگ میبرد. ا. شربیانی
This one felt super short! Nothing really happened! At least we did learn about (view spoiler)[how Mr Crepsley got his scar. Interesting. (hide spoiler)] And we went back to (view spoiler)[the Cirque to see Evra again! And he's got kids now. So strange, especially the name of his son, Shankus. I definitely wouldn't name my kid that XD (hide spoiler)]Who knows when I'll get to the next one, but I will see where they go next.
Nothing like opening a book in a series and finding out it’s skipped forward…by six years.
Darren hasn’t seemed to think or tend to the views of the former traitor he was considering before (peace treaties), and while not enjoying killing, does it with more natural ease when it’s needed.
Or else, when he thinks it’s needed.
Curious and revving to go continue this journey in the next book – these just fly by when reading them.Another four star book in the series that works in making this world more complex, more captivating.
So Evanna turned out to be a traitor.
Kind of.
:/Pretty school character additions.
Vancha is pretty badass.
Feel bad for him having to battle his brother.
But the whole hand to hand is pretty cool.
Evanna is awesome too.
Her frogs freak me out a bit, but I kinda wish I had some.
Oh, and I like her back story.
It would be weird being made by Mr. Tiny.
Oh, and Mr. Tiny.
I love that they went back to the cirque.
I still wish he'd spent more time.
Honestly, I would love if this series were nothing but the cirque.
Thinking back a few years to the time I tried many vampire series friends of mine loved I almost lost interest completely.
I was relieved to see that this book didn’t look like any of the other vampire books I tried to read so I didn’t have come up with an excuse why I couldn’t read this series.
I usually read these books when I’m reading a something that’s hard to get through and I need a break.I liked this book but I did have a few problems with some things:This book had a new character I didn’t like.
This book in the series is very much focused around the larger plot related to the twelve books. Whilst some of the previous books were focused more upon Darren’s experiences this one brings us back to the war which is going on.After being visited by a character from one of the past books, our main characters find themselves at the Cirque once again. Here events are not quite what they once seemed, with questionable motives in the air. Our characters find out that completing the mission that they are upon isn’t quite as straight forward as it may seem.
Good book. Fun story. Great characters. Cover scares the crap out of me.
so I absolutely love this book and I loved how it was different to the others in the sense that it was told 6 years on and we get to find out what Darren's been doing in that time all of his training how he decided to do the games even though he didn't have to and everything about the Vampaneze and how he and Mr Crepsley and the little person needed to go on a secret Mission this was my favourite bit in the book That's funny.
You were singing about how much you … loved it earlier.
'Ale, ale, I drink like a whale, I am the … Prince, the Prince of ale'."
The short amount of time with Darren inside Vampire Mountain in The Vampire Prince was more than enough, six years honestly might have killed me.
It’s taken many set up books but at least the end is in the horizon.In Hunters of the Dark, after a six year time skip, Darren and the vampires are at war with the vampaneze.
I can see the potential in him and liked him a bit close to the end of the book.Things I Didn't LikeMy biggest problem with Hunters of the Dusk was how boring it was.
I found myself having to really persist with this book, the pace of it seemed very slow compared to the past books and the story a tad boring and stale at times.I did however quite enjoy the last quarter of the book, even though it was very obvious apart from one point which was quite refreshing. An overall mediocre read in my opinion.
3.5
Young Darren Shan is now one of the leaders of the vampires because making him a prince was the only way that the other princes could legally excuse him for failing to pass the trials.
It’s hard to believe, first, that Darren had to do the trials at all, and second, that the vampire princes can’t manage to change or otherwise get around the ancient rules.
He also has an encounter with the vampaneze and learns a little more about Mr. Tiny and Mr. Crepsley.Readers who’ve read this far in CIRQUE DU FREAK are unlikely to turn back now and this is another fast moving exciting story.
Comes a well expected vsit by all vampires, Desmond Tiny who is hated by the vampires made a prophecy talking about the Vampaneze Lord and a great war.
Now, it's up to Darren Shan, Mr. Crepsley and a the Vampire Prince Vancha March to find the Vampaneze Lord and kill him before he brings the end to all vampires.Mr. Tiny tells them that they have five chances to kill the Vampaneze Lord.
Darren Shan, now a Vampire of high standing, is sent on a mission along with an Elite Squad to eliminate the threat of the murderous Vampaneze and their Lord. Will Darren succeed, and if he does, will it have been worth it? Expanding on the books before it, “ Hunters of the Dusk” might seem like a good book at first. It has action, as well as a fairly interesting plot. However, the problem in the last book has not been fixed. Darren Shan, a mere, young, half-vampire, is chosen by an agent of De
Darren Shan, now a Vampire of high standing, is sent on a mission along with an Elite Squad to eliminate the threat of the murderous Vampaneze and their Lord.
Darren Shan, a mere, young, half-vampire, is chosen by an agent of Destiny to be part of an Elite Squad supposed to eradicate a race of the equivalent of murderous Vampires.
I think that this is a bit of a stretch for a series that was about a boy who doesn’t fit in, due to Vampiric powers, but about a boy who doesn’t fit in nonetheless.
This book, along with the one after this, were my least favorite in the series.
Him, Mr.Crepsley, and another vamipre had to go and stop the vampaneze lord.
They wanted to go and kill the vampaneze lord before he comes to takes over the vampire clan.
So Darren and the other vampires have to go and stop the vampaneze lord before he gets fully blooded.
But, only the 3 vampires and anything besides vampires could go after the vampaneze lord.
Then Darren, Crepsley, Harkat (the little person), and Vancha ambushed them and killed all but Vancha's brother and a Vampet who was just with them, but that someone was the Vampaneze Lord!
Mr. Tiny tells Mr. Crepsley and Darren that they have to go find the Vampaneze Lord and kill him, and that only them and one other vampire that they will find later can kill him.
Darren and Mr. Crepsley go to find the other vampire, so they start searching.
They find Vancha March, the third vampire.
All three of them want to find the Vampaneze Lord, but they don't know where to start, so they just follow their instincts.
Then, they do find him, and while trying to kill him, they killed all the Vampaneze except Vancha March's brother, and one other.
This was definitely another one of the filler books. Even though this was longer than the last two, not much happened. All they did was start their journey to find the vampanze lord (view spoiler)[ and missed him (hide spoiler)]It was nice to back at the Cirque Du Freak and see how they've changed. I really like how the author used Evra growing up to really show how much time has passed (view spoiler)[ He married with kids!! (hide spoiler)]The best part of this book was the introduction of Lady

I really like how the author used Evra growing up to really show how much time has passed (view spoiler)[ He married with kids!!
(hide spoiler)]The best part of this book was the introduction of Lady Evanna, another all powerful witch character.
I hope to see more of her in future book (this series is really lacking in female representation!!)
THIS BOOK DOES NOT have any Cirque Du FreakUnfortunately, this book has completely veered off from the original series. I remember my first time time through it that I was throwing my hands up in the air going -  where's the freaks?? I really enjoyed the first few books where they are running around with the circus - meeting all the quirky characters and getting into trouble. This book definitely feels like everyone is in for the long hall.Audiobook CommentsRead by Ralph Lister - an excellent reader!Blog | Instagram | Twitter
This book is another book that is about the vampire Darren.
He has become more mature and he has gained new friends that have stuck with him since he became the vampire he is now.
I can connect this book to the world because it shows that once you have someone to guide you, you will be able to accomplish what ever you want to do.
In the world there are many people who like to help others with there future.I rate this book 4 and 1/2 stars because I thought it was really good out of the Cirque Du Freak books that i read.
Hunters of the Dusk was most definitely the least interesting of the series thus far, which is upsetting since it's supposed to be drawing closer to the huge finale. Nevertheless, I did find myself enjoying the snippets of information that were littered every so often about Harkat's previous form! I believe he was maybe the brother to Evanna… I'm also pretty sure that the Vampeneze Lord is Steve Leopard/Leonard — since that would make perfect sense!
This book is about vampirers trying to fight the vanpaneze. They even have vanpaneze pets to go out for them to find out where the vanpirers are trying to hide from them. And the vampaneze pets go back and tell the vampaneze where the vampires are thats if they can even find the vampires. the vampires and the vampaneze are always fighting. The vampires are usually always beating the vampaneze in their fights that they have. I think they choose darren to be prince.
Darren is now the prince and have quests to do, it is just the beginning. The author made it very fun by adding thoughts, I like reading their thoughts and 'watching' their actions. It's pretty exciting when they are fighting their enemies. Everyone should try this book out, continue with the next book! I can't stop reading the series because their too FUN!!!
I love this series and I can only imagine what I will do when I'm finished it. I can't really say anything without giving anything away. All I can say though is it will surprise you. I am so glad I got Devin, Courtney, Zack, Daniel and maybe Mr.C reading this series. I hope they all love it as much as I do, and as always I can't wait to start the next one!
I stayed up pretty late to finish this book and it was worth it. Darren always seems to have this 'vampire luck' while afterwards it seems that it wasn't much like luck at all. I love how short these books all are though
خود کتاب رو دوست دارم. کلاً دارن باحال مینویسه 0_0 نکته هایی هم بود ک میخواسم بگم ک الان یادم نیس o:-)
“He fled to save the life of the man he was protecting -the fake servant- the…” Imagine that you have been stuck in a mountain for six years serving as a vampire prince, working with generals to defeat your enemies, the vampaneze.
In Cirque Du Freak: Hunters of the Dusk, Darren Shan, Vancha March, and Mr. Crepsley hunt for their arch-nemesis, The Vampaneze Lord.
Like almost every other book in the series, this one has no conclusion.
This book didn't have a conclusion, unlike last book (which is probably the second in the series to have one).
Altho he’s still the Boy Prince to the other vampires (cuz he a youngin) he’s finally got the physical growth he’d been denied after blooding.
I was howling with laughter at that part, who’d have thunk that Larten’s badass looking scar was something he got from trying to get frisky with the wrong person 😂Speaking of Evanna, the information she revealed to Darren makes for quite a twist!
And she confirmed that if the Vampires are successful Darren would become the Shadow Lord instead.
In the timespan of the book, it’s literally been about twelve years since Darren last saw Evra.
I try to think about what it would be like right now, to see someone again that I last saw twelve years ago (when I was in eighth grade or a freshman in high school).
😀There’s some great art of Evra and other Cirque du Freak characters on DeviantArt by the way.
And of other things in general.There are also two new characters introduced in this book, Vancha March and Lady Evanna.
Lady Evanna is the daughter of Mr. Tiny, and the sister of Mr. Tall (from the Cirque).
The Cirque Du Freak series is perfect for those wanting something darker than a normal YA book, while not going off the deep end.
In the middle of the War of Scars, Darren learns that he is one of three that must search out the Vampaneze Lord and kill him in order to save all the vampires.
The books span years, and I wouldn't not want to read about six years of war when the events that affect Darren don't happen until after that.
This book does not focus just on vampires, the members of the Cirque Du Freak make a short appearance.
