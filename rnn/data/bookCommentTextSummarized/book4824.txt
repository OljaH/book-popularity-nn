Couldn't they come up with a better book cover? This cover makes me physically sick every-time I see it. :(
This was a rather strange book.
At first, it seems to be about a group of people travelling to tell Don Juan's father, Don Saturno, that his son is dead.
Then later it's about the small village, Viejo Tenorio, where Don Juan's family comes from and all the people living there.
The author describes the miller, the priest, the school teacher, the inn keeper and the farmers and the lives of them and their families.
I enjoyed the book, which was well-written with interesting characters, but I think I missed a lot because I don't know that much about Spanish history.
This is a work of fiction acting as an anti-facist moralty play.
It is set in 1800 Spain, but was written in the 1930s as Spain was threated by facism.
I loved the sense of humor the writer imbues when describing all characters and the story itself is quite humorous until about two thirds of the way through, thats when all the action happens and everyone dies.
I do think that Townsend Warner provided a successful vehicle to better understand the struggles of the commoner under both fuedal and facist regimes.
Also the character of Dona Ana facinated me and I was sorry to see her leave the narrative.
Found it fairly quick to get into, though the characters are not well drawn, there is some humour in this tale. A story that doesn't take itself seriously, with a character called Don Juan I was expecting some shenanigans, and there are plots and tricks a plenty.
