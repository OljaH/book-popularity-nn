A toast, to The Complete Rhyming Dictionary...for all the years that I was to broke to afford the internet, hence, online rhyming sites.
For a poet, or a musician...mostly a musician,, because "roses are red, violets are blue..." type poems aren't too popular these days, a rhyming dictionary can be a life-safer.
Many a night, I've been writing a song only to be stumped because I couldn't find something that rhymed with colloquially...not to worry though, The Complete Rhyming Dictionary gave me options like, "substantially" or "most definitely", or perhaps "I'm ready to pee" the choices were suddenly limitless.
Has a significant amount of rhyming words, although there are occasional additions that need to be made. Excellent for folks writing rhyming poetry, but only for those willing to think of their rhyming sounds phonetically. And not all folks are willing to work it that way.My only negative about this book is that its binding breaks far too easily, and I wish it were available in hardcover.
Best one I have ever come acrossIncludes all the proper ways to write a verse
a constant companion since the early eighties. I purchased a 1943 edition at Soho Books in NYC. I don't think it cost more than $5.00. A great investment.
Only about eight thousand times better than the piddly children's rhyming dictionary I had been pretending was good enough for way too long.
The best rhyming dictionary I've found. Intended more for writers and poets then song writers.
Helped me when the words were lost
This is the best rhyming dictionary for sure.
