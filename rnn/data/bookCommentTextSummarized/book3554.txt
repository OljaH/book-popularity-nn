Instead, the author really focused on the massive injustices done to the Native people, and puts Geronimo in a sympathetic light."The Apaches have done far less to us than we have to them.
We take what is most important to them, they take from us what is of little value to them."Interesting and unlooked for point of view.The story, as is usual with Burroughs, is fast paced and intriguing, the characters sharply defined and true to life, if perhaps a little over dramatized.The only thing I disliked about it was the continual reference to the Native paganism.
This is the sequel to the war chief. Excellent story. OP

This is the second novel of the "Apache" series, a Western and historical fiction which includes a very sympathetic biography of the life of Geronimo. The novel's fictional hero is a white orphaned adoptee into the Apaches. The story combines Burroughs usual adventure tale with historical fact, romance, heartbreaking tragedy, and a powerful statement of the evil of racial bigotry. I think every Burroughs fan should read the "Apache" series.
A sequel to The War Chief, Shoz-Dijiji, the Black Bear, has lost his love, Ish-kay-nay, to death, killed his mortal enemy, Juh, the Apache, and does not understand his attraction to the white woman, Wichita Billings, he takes up the warpath as the Apache Devil.
Part 2 of a set Burroughs wrote on Indians. Great fast paced action. Recommended
ERB's sad account of the demise of the Apache. Marred by a painful heroine called 'Wichita', and an uneasy ending.
A great weatern pulp story, just not as good as the book that preceded it.
Saw this at my locale used book store, had to pick it up. Hope it won't be too stereotypical, but regardless, should be a fun read...
read some time in 1985
Only okay. Pretty leaden prose, honestly.
A satisfying sequel to The War Chief.
