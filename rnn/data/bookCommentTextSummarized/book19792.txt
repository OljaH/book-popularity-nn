But I am glad I did pick it up, however.Greg Heffley is a loser: bullied by his elder brother and followed about by his tattletale younger one, ignored by the pretty girls and able to befriend only the unspeakable Rowley, he must be justified in feeling that life is unjust to him.
In Vanity Fair, Thackeray's illustrations are as famous as his words.)Greg, in this book, has grown up a little from his previous outing.
Yet, they are lovable, all the same.Jeff Kinney has written a book that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.Recommended whenever one needs a mood uplift!
Ok, so I read this book to see why my students seem to love it so.
Now, I'm all for silly humor.
I can understand that, but I don't get the attraction for this book.
I hated it.
I finished it in a little over a day, but never did I stop wishing for it to end.
I think the characters were horrible; the people in the book did mean things to each other; every person in the book was inconsiderate to each other; etc.
I know I'm going to hurt some feelings next week when I report to my students my feelings about this book, but it really wasn't good.
it was also very funny and kids who can read should deffntly read it
awesome!!!!!!!!!!
Rodrick Rules was just as funny and descriptive as the other. In this book, Greg has disturbing conflicts with his brother that enrages Greg. As Greg states his *moments* with Rodrick, he discovers Rodrick has been rather mean too him. I can't wait to read the third book!
This book is great. Because it is base on a true movie. But my faviorite part was when Rodick (older brother of greg).Made a big party and greg had to help Rodick pick up the mess but Rodick and greg was lucky at first. ut then
I swear this was funny 😂😂😂 hell a lot funny than the first one! So it was about Gregory and his relationship with his brother Rodrick, and even though my relation with my brother was never the same but this! This was so funny.The last page with the scientific experiment on plants and black pepper made me crack up!
This book I can't describe:DIt's funnyI read it so slow, so the laugh doesn't end of my day:)Just a little something:-dad said to Rodrick: well, for starters Abraham Lincon didin't write "to kill a mockingbird":DhahahaI really recommend this book to everyone wanna have a relaxing time.ENJOY
The cartoons were cute and funny -- some parents may think that means younger kids can read it, but the reading level is definitely around 5th grade and older.
Think the age the first HP book was aimed at, and you have the correct reading age for this book.Why I didn't like it?
It wasn't funny, intelligent, life-changing or in any way great.
The only decent thing about this book is that it apparently opens the door into reading for boys who otherwise showed little interest.I say buy them the "Great Brain" series.
Nothing Tom and his Great Brain can't handle.
Having an older bother like Rodrick is not trouble enough that Gregory has to spend a week with him 
گرگ به نوشتن خاطرات روزمرهش در قالب طنز تو دفترچه خاطراتش ادامه میده.داستان جلد دوم تو همون مایهی جلد اوله و چیز خاصی اضافه نمیشه.به نظرم فضای کتاب زیادی پسرونهست و در واقع هیچ شخصیت دختری تو این کتاب حضور نداره. این موضوع رو کاهش جذابیتش برای من تاثیر داشت. کاش گرگ یه خواهر هم داشت! :))

coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
I am reviewing this one soon for sure!
Anyone who has a sibling or siblings could relate to Greg in this 2nd installment. Aside from Manny, Rodrick is one of my favorite character in this series. Rodrick could be a little pain in the ass for Greg but behind his facade, he cares and love for his younger brothers even though he just doesn't want to admit it.
I haven’t yet discussed this book with someone who doesn’t know how the game Dungeons and Dragons works, so I wonder if a D&D newbie would find the game in which Greg’s mom joins (calling her character “Mom”) as funny as I did.
For a sequel, there’s a lot of new stuff in this book as well.
That said, it’s hard not to feel vindicated when Rodrick finally has something bad happen to him at the end of the book.
Greg has unfortunately been picking up a lot of Rodrick's personality traits too; he plays mean tricks on his classmates and is horrible to his "best friend." At this point I kind of want to read Rowley's diary more than Greg's.His parents aren't much better either.
Now I don't believe that the majority of children will be warped by reading about how to play mean tricks on people and get away with doing bad things, but this book wasn't very funny and the characters didn't have any redeeming qualities at all.

به نظرم نسبت به کتاب اول خیلی ضعیفتر بود.یک نکتهای که ذهنم رو مشغول کرده اینه که این مجموعه چقدر میتونه روی رفتار بچههایی که اون رو میخونن تأثیر بذاره؟ خواهرزادهی من تمام کتابهای این مجموعه رو خونده و میتونم رد روابط خصمانهی رودریک و گرگ رو توی رفتارش با خواهر کوچکترش ببینم. شاید من زیاد حساس شده باشم، شاید این طبیعت رفتار خواهر و برادرها توی سنین پایین و با اختلاف سنی 5 ساله، شاید هم واقعا زیادی از این کتاب تأثیر گرفته. نمیدونم. البته که کتاب طنزه ولی به هر حال زیاد الگوی خوبی برای روابط درونخا

Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney is an exciting and hilarious journey of Greg Heffley.
In Rodrick Rules, Jeff Kinney focuses on the relationship of Greg and his brothers, Rodrick and Manny.
Rodrick is older than Greg, and is much more 'corrupt'.
Manny on the other hand, never gets caught doing bad things.
Greg somehow always gets blamed for Manny's problems, which starts many conflict between them and also the family.
I really enjoyed it simply because I love funny, 1st person books.
Rodrick Rules was also my e-book.
I really enjoyed the experience of reading a book on my mom's kindle.
The main character of this book has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
Bottom line: There is no character growth in these books.
I am only forced to read this series because I have to plan a Wimpy Kid party for work.
Fortunately, they are quick reads, which is probably why kids choose them in the first place.
I am sick of people saying, "Well, at least they're reading." Parents and teachers, get a clue: Books live with children for the rest of their lives.
If this is the kind of stuff you want inspiring the kids in your life, I weep for the future of our society.
I re-read this because after reading Outlander I feel like nothing will compare, so I'm stuck in a loop of children's books.
It's not that I can't read an adult book it's that I don't want to.
I feel like my love of Outlander will cause a bad rating and review for the next romance read so I stuck with these.Also, I've always enjoyed these books.
My reviews from earlier didn't do this book justice, so I thought I'd re-read and re-rate the series because I love them.
Honestly if you're looking for a laugh I recommend these, they also definitely help get over a book slump!
Rodrick Rules wasn't as hilarious as the first book of the series (but was still a pretty funny and quick read). I'm guessing that's because Greg is growing up and adults are pretty boring, you know. Still, I'll definitely give the third book a try. I actually can't wait to see what Manny has in store for us (I really really like that kid).
As expected.. so good to read :)
Εντάξει, τι να πω... σχεδόν το λυπήθηκα το παιδί.... δύσκολη η εφηβεία και το σχολείο και οι γονείς που δεν σε καταλαβαίνουν και τα αδέρφια που σε πρήζουν....
Anyone who has ever suffered at the hands of an older brother or sister, or even worse, been sandwiched in between older and younger siblings, will thoroughly enjoy this cartoon novel delivered in the guise of the journal of the beleaguered, under-appreciated and very funny Gregory.
This book makes an especially excellent reading suggestion for reluctant boy readers.
The third in the series is forthcoming!SLJ: "He's a character that readers can laugh at and empathize with at the same time.
Ch-ching!
I've been spending way too much time lately with my new best friend Greg Heffley.
That kid doesn't have a clue, which makes him all the more hilarious.
Yeah, he's self-absorbed with no self-awareness.
Yeah, he's a jerk to his best friend, his family, and his teachers.
I'm not sure that being totally oblivious makes this ok, but it certainly makes it funny.How many times do we unceremoniously give back-handed compliments?
How many times do we give with the expectation of getting?
we're really just unselfish people out to help others all the time, right?
Things haven't changed much for him--he still thinks he's cooler than his best friend Rowley, his parents are still nerdily out of touch, and Greg is still running for the coveted Class Clown title.
Unfortunately, that's not all that hasn't changed over the summer--younger brother Manny is still a tattletale, older brother Rodrick is still a bully, and Greg still has the Cheese Touch.
Only now Manny is spilling secrets from ages ago, Rodrick has a new secret to hold over Greg's head, and all Greg's plans continue to backfire in horrifically hilarious ways.
Rodrick Rules is every bit as satisfying--though Greg will tell you more embarrassing--as its predecessor.
