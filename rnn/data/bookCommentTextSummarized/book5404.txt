An entertaining trio of Nero Wolfe novellas featuring: 1) a wheelchair-bound widower with three live-in eligible females, 2) a mysterious message coded in the geometric arrangement of eight pencils, and 2) a plot to fix a Giants and Red Sox world series.Thoroughly enjoyable.
The detective thinks Archie Goodwin is a great expect on women and Archie himself shares this delusion, so off he went to investigate.
Most of Wolfe's investigations are related to murders, and this time he was not disappointed as Archie soon stumbles upon one.
The team owner asked Wolfe to investigate the crime and Archie Goodwin whose favorite team just lost an important game due to a foul play is happy to help.
This is a unique story in sense that both Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin solved the mystery at the same time independently using different approaches.
Rex Stout's "Three Men Out" (1954) is the 23rd book in his "Nero Wolfe" series.
The first of those short stories is very good.
It's written in good Stout/Wolfe form with a good plot and mystery.
The premise of what the people in the story are doing is a bit silly and the mystery a bit weak, but it's still good Stout/Wolfe.
Most of it reads like a Crime Drama instead of a Mystery.
It's pretty trite and just doesn't read like what we'd expect from a Stout/Wolfe story.
The first story about the dangers of upsetting extended family in-laws was the least sparkling of the group, but the bizarre twists during the story, especially Archie tricking Wolfe into coming to the scene, make it different enough to be enjoyable.
The extended red herring throughout (especially the way it builds and builds upon itself as we become more aware of it) was definitely an enjoyable misdirection.
The final story is a strange mix of baseball skullduggery and a wholly atypical scene of genuine danger, with Archie really shining on his own, though likely in ways in which we may not approve.
The three novellas that make up this volume are all fun reads and top notch mysteries. The first was my favorite, as Archie comes up with an ingenious method of getting Wolfe to leave the brownstone for a case. The enjoyment of the third story comes mainly from Wolfe's discomfort at having to attend a baseball game and being able to only perch on the edge of his seat. Fun tales from one of my favorite authors.
Just one more in my long list of favorite Nero Wolfe books.......to be truthful, they are all my favorites. This little book contains three short stories and in one, Wolfe actually goes to a baseball game which makes it worthwhile just to imagine him trying to fit into one of those stadium seats. Simple stories with the typical Rex Stout wit. that are good for a rainy afternoon.
Three Nero Wolfe mysteries are better than one--that must be why Stout wrote so many novellas and published them in compilations of three. In this collection, the title is a giveaway to expect three male corpses. It's notable because in two of the novellas, Wolfe leaves his house, which he tries to avoid doing.
A Friday night spent with Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe is never wasted; I don't think Stout was capable of writing less than a 4-star book. Even so these stories are not the cream of the crop. I'd still rather read Stout at less than his best, than any other mystery writer...
This is a collection of three stories, not as satisfying as a novel, but still entertaining. In the last story, Wolfe actually goes to a baseball game, because a famous visiting foreign chef wants to see one. Wolfe in uncomfortable situations is always amusing.
A solid trio of Nero Wolfe stories.The first had a clever resolution, the second a clever idea and the third a unique setting.
Sometimes, a novella is just enough. This collection of 3 Nero Wolfe mysteries works very well. Short and sweet, solved in typical Wolfe style.
This isn't the best collection of Nero Wolfe novelettes. Indeed the last of the trio has a major hitch in the tale, but still even a bad Nero Wolfe story is better than 90% of most mystery tales.
Three separate stories in a single novel. Each of these involves Nero coming out of his house. Not great in terms of plot but a decent read none the less.
Haven’t read one of these in years. Three stories with Wolfe solving crimes basically by working through the possibilities until the criminal cracks. In two, amazingly, Wolfe ventures outside his house - very rare! The usual snappy dialogue by Archie plays against Nero’s mannered egoism. The baseball one was new to me.
Quando, há mais de dez anos, descobri os livros de Rex Stout fiquei viciado no ambiente que criou para o seu formidável detective Nero Wolfe, que nunca sai da sua mansão em Nova Iorque e que deixa as actividades no terreno necessárias à investigação a cargo do esperto, despachado e musculado quando é preciso Archie Goodwin, que também é o seu secretário e o narrador.
Lembro-me de até ter feito contas aos livros que Rex Stout escreveu, porque eram imensos, mas finitos, e preocupava-me imaginar que um dia ficaria sem as suas histórias para ler.
When he suspects a client of criminal activities, the mathematician sends for Nero Wolfe, but he is killed before Archie has had time to do more than notice the six people in the waiting room.
It is among those six people that the criminal and now murderer must be found, but will Wolfe have enough clues to solve the case?
In “Invitation to Murder”, where Wolfe sends Archie to find out which of three women has her hooks in the client's uncle, and Archie tricks Wolfe into leaving his home on business.In “The Zero Clue”, Archie goes to the office of a mathematics genius who rivals Wolfe in solving mysteries, fails to discover his body, and Wolfe reveals the killer to the entire homicide squad of Manhattan.In “This Won't Kill You”, Wolfe, Archie and Wolfe's guest go to the seventh game of the World Series at the Polo Grounds (where the Giants played when they were a New York team) and Wolfe is asked to solve the mystery of who drugged four players so the Red Sox could win the series (as a die-hard Red Sox fan, apparently the only way Stout could visualize the Sox winning the series was with chemical help.) It peaks in one of the most dangerous situations Archie has ever been in, and later Wolfe, still at the ball park, unmasks a killer.Each of the stories involves a minor puzzle and usually Wolfe makes a critical observation that leads him to the culprit without resorting to the lip exercises he does when he's really working.
Not a novel but three short stories, memorable in that Wolf leaves his house for two of them, perhaps why it misses the top mark though.
The weakest of the stories but Stout does a good job with putting lipstick on the female stereotypes and they are not bland cardboard predictable.The Zero Clue: Another standard setup, assemble the (6) suspects in one room and ferret out the murderer with cleverness and inspiration.
This Won't Kill You: Wolfe at the Polo Grounds as the Giants lose the series with key players drugged and one murdered.
Sometimes in a murder mystery, the detective arrives on the scene after the body has been found, and must gather clues about the crime after the fact.
Some murder mysteries unfold with the murder happening right under the detective's nose.
I like that kind better because everything that happens from the beginning could be a clue.
The first novella in this series, Invitation to Murder, is structured that way and, of the three, it was the one I liked the best.
The second novella was the weakest, to me, with a lot of obviously extraneous informatioand an abrupt ending.
Invitation to Murder ***The Zero Clue ***This Won't Kill You ***My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
Book 23 in the Nero Wolfe series; another trio of novellas including Invitation to Murder, The Zero Clue, and This Won’t Kill You. The latter is set at the World Series, and involves doping of a honey-flavored soft drink named Beebright [the second Wolfe mystery I can recall involving a poisoned soft drink], and murder by baseball bat in the clubhouse. Now the title of the book makes more sense: Three Men Out is another baseball reference.
I've read all but a handful of the enormous number of Nero Wolfe mysteries Stout produced. I have found in general that the collections of novellas are generally less engaging than the full-length books, and this is one of the weakest of the novella series. Of the three stories in this volume, only the second one ("The Zero Clue")really engaged me. Unless you are committed to reading the entire Stout collection, this is one to skip.
Another fun read with three novellas featuring Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Much as I enjoy these shorter stories they don't always allow Stout to have quite so much fun with language and Archie's baiting of his boss or Inspector Cramer.And there is a lot of baseball in the third story.Fun though.
This is a collection of three shorter mysteries. In two of them Wolfe leaves the brownstone. I really liked Invitation to Murder and The Zero Clue which were the first two in the collection. This Won't Kill You takes place at a baseball game and had a bit too much baseball in it for me, but it was another great clue that solved the murder.
I love Nero Wolfe, and I like short stories...unfortunately Wolfe really needs an entire novel to shine to my satisfaction. These stories were good, but just when you're being to get caught up into the story it's over. The introduction by Linda Ellerbee is a a treat...she manages to pinpoint one of the reasons I enjoy mysteries in general, and Nero Wolfe in particular.
I was in the mood for light/quick re-read, and this fit the bill. But it's definitely not a pinnacle of the Wolfe cannon, even if it drags Wolfe out of the house more than once. The plots are thin, and Wolfe basically materializes the solution to the second story out of nowhere, and it's never fully explained. Just okay.
My father's love for baseball has been rubbing off a little, so I highly enjoyed reading the last story, "This won't kill you," of Archie and Wolfe at a baseball game. Wolfe at a baseball game. Imagine that.
Three brilliant short stories. Tightly packed with action and info-if you pay very close attention, you can figure each solution out-but most likely you'll geet caught up in all the action and let it unfold in Nero's usual way.
Three short stories, the first and last are pretty good, the middle one is entirely forgettable. The last is one of my favorites for its absurdity... Somehow Wolfe and Goodwin get tickets to game 7 of the World Series, and end up solving a murder and proving the outcome was rigged.
