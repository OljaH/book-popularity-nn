A fine expression of modernist faith. So, God is not a felt presence, but a conjuring of Eliot’s wish that the world be other than a hollow waste land.

Like all T.S. Elliot poems of this era it is a masterwork. I found, for the third time, a self-narrated audio version of an Eliot poem. I felt that since today was Ash Wednesday there was no better time to listened to this. This poem is significant for being the first poem Eliot wrote after his conversion and he seems to be really making up for "lost" time in this poem.[I will be doing a more thorough review at a later date]
با حرفهای بهزاد موافقمبا اینکه شان برخی کلمات را در انگلیسی برابر نگرفته، اما دقت در این کار هنر بیژن است که زیاده نرود، انقدر که متن الان زیاده کهن نمیزند، دست ببری در جملات میبینی گاهی از روی وزن کاری کرده و در کل ترجمهای که به دست داده جای شکر دارد. مثلن مقایسه کنید با چهار کوارتت که صمدی برگردانده و خب تقریبن غیر قابل فهم است.

I read a bilingual version, with Portuguese translation by the poet Rui Knopfli. Very moving and peaceful. Precious work of art.
Wow.
بیژن الهی روزم رو ساخت... عالی بود، عالی...
Um homem que, tendo estado longe de Deus, O procura com sofreguidão. É o que a poesia tem de ser.Porque eu sei que o tempo é sempre tempoE o lugar é sempre e somente o lugarE o que é real é-o uma vez somenteE somente para um lugarEu rejubilo porque as coisas são como são eRenuncio ao rosto benditoE renuncio à vozPorque eu não posso esperar voltar de novo.
"Because I know that time is always timeAnd place is always and only placeAnd what is actual is actual only for one timeAnd only for one placeI rejoice that things are as they are andI renounce the blessed faceAnd renounce the voiceBecause I cannot hope to turn againConsequently I rejoice, having to construct somethingUpon which to rejoice"
thus, tonight i finished the eliot course in my syllabus. still, can anyone finish reading eliot? this is a rhetorical question. this great mind makes me think in so many ways. so, there's this sense of lack in reading eliot, still. one should keep going on and on. "ash wednesday" is one of those poems. with this, i bid you goodnight. i feel so peaceful, where being atheist does not matter right now. so peaceful (till now). goonight!
“Because I do not hope to turn againBecause I do not hopeBecause I do not hope to turnDesiring this man's gift and that man's scopeI no longer strive to strive towards such things(Why should the aged eagle stretch its wings?)Why should I mournThe vanished power of the usual reign?”
a poetic mediation, full of imagery, fitting for the opening of the season of repentance and coming clean
More striking heard than read but more beautiful read.
Published in 1930, “Ash Wednesday” is Eliot's resolution poem. It is not his final poem, but it does mark the end of an age of his poetry. In it he answers the questions posed in the previous poems, expresses the conclusion of his search for truth, and sheds new light on his previous works. Not all of his questions are answered in this poem, but he is definitely more satisfied. From the first lines, Eliot expresses his confidence in his conversion to the Anglican church. “Because I do not hope
In it he answers the questions posed in the previous poems, expresses the conclusion of his search for truth, and sheds new light on his previous works.
“I do not hope to know again/ The infirm glory of the positive hour.” (Ash Wednesday I, Lines 9-10) With his faith, Eliot's temporary happiness is replaced by permanent, justifiable joy.
Like seeing the light side of the moon, Eliot takes the metaphors he used earlier to express pain and uses them to express satisfaction.
If one can see Eliot through his poetry, one can see that his conversion was equally life-changing.
"And pray to God to have mercy upon usAnd pray that I may forgetThese matters that with myself I too much discussToo much explainBecause I do not hope to turn againLet these words answerFor what is done, not to be done againMay the judgement not be too heavy upon us"
He plays with sand and words and dry rocks and wet rocks.
So beautifully.In him, we walk down the river of words, beating, rhyming, in simile and in contrast, in Dante and in Shakespeare, and in Christianity and in Culturanity.
In this river, we see the real zombies; ones with words unspoken, thoughts unheard.
The zombies, who are men ripped of meaning and men ripped of sense.
Ash Wednesday is an epic, and I can and cannot imagine it otherwise, and I need only myself to tell the difference, and the zombie to tell the contradiction.
"If the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spentIf the unheard, unspokenWord is unspoken, unheard;Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,The Word without a word, the Word withinThe world and for the world;And the light shone in darkness andAgainst the Word the unstilled world still whirledAbout the centre of the silent Word."Hearing Tommy Eliot recite these lines with aplomb brought a huge grin to my face.
I understand why some think it's heavy-handed (I don't think it is), but Eliot surely cannot be faulted for lack of passion.
I haven't found this sort of ardent verse in Eliot, not even in the Quartets.
Life likened to a tension. Powerful work from the period in which Eliot was turning more towards religion. Soberer and more deathobsessed. The blazon becomes a personal sacrifice to scavenging animals in the desert; Eliot's futile eternal bones become utilized even more powerfully as they become useless and are rightly scattered: better never to have been assembled.
Part II was by far my favorite section.
I don't think I like Eliot very much.
Eliot's great poem about modernism and faith.
O my people.
«Profetiza ao vento, apenas ao vento que apenas o vento escutará» (op. cit.).
