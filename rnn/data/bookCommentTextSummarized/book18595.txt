“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Isabelle. Paris is overrun. The Nazis control the city. What is an eighteen-year-old girl to do about all of that?” What, indeed.I really didn't know what to expect going into The Nightingale. Given the quote about love and war in the blurb, I kind of thought it might be an historical romance set during the Second World War - like the world really needs another The Bronze Horseman - but it turned out to be so much more than that.There are love stories in The Nightingale,
Given the quote about love and war in the blurb, I kind of thought it might be an historical romance set during the Second World War - like the world really needs another The Bronze Horseman - but it turned out to be so much more than that.There are love stories in The Nightingale, but that's not really what the book is about.
The main story is about two very different sisters - Vianne and Isabelle - who are trying to survive during wartime.
It's that kind of book." But don't worry, that isn't the story being told here and Isabelle has a lot to learn.
Clichéd writing isn’t just resorting continually to stock phrases (though Hannah does this a lot); it’s also straining for tension through exaggeration to the point where dramatic tension degenerates into melodrama.
No surprise that clichéd phrases often perform a task of exaggeration.
It’s mostly set in a small town in the middle of France yet this small town is “swarming” with German soldiers, Gestapo, SS, Jews, bomb damage as if the entire war is centred there (I was only surprised Hitler and Eva Braun didn’t have a holiday home there as well).
With tears still running down my cheeks I'm writing this review. I've started this review several times and I don't think I'll be able to adequately put into words the power in which this novel has moved me. Truely a remarkable story that I, literally, beg everyone who loves historical fiction to read. I will be gushing about this novel for some time to come.
Beautiful.
I've been told by so many people that I need to read this book.
It gets so much hype that I thought there was absolutely NO way it would live up to it.
I absolutely adored it.
Even just thinking about it now I am fighting back tears because this was such a beautiful and vivid story.
The women in particular, the sisters, were absolutely inspirational.
If you like WWII historical fiction, or even if you don't, I encourage you to try this book out.
I know I'm going to be encouraging basically everyone I know to read it.
And there are some exciting scenes featuring the French resistance's efforts to get downed pilots out of France.
But there are also some small but annoying anachronisms (antibiotics were not really available until after the war; Germans didn't put up signs saying people would be put in "concentration camps").
Then there is what is supposed to be a twist at the end, but I felt like I saw it coming.So if you really, really love WWII historicals this might be worth your time, but I've read better from Kristin Hannah and much better about WWII.
The ending was so powerful that I read the last 10 pages with tears pouring down my face and days after finishing my read, I still can't stop thinking about it.I will say upfront though that this book was a little different than the kinds I usually read and review though because it wasn't solely focused on a love story, even though there were two love stories within it.While men endure great hardship during war, it affects everyone.
I'm not sure what I can say about this book that hasn't already been said, but the quality and sheer excellence to this story blew my mind.
I'm not typically a fan of historical fiction, which is likely why I've avoided it for so long, but once this was described to me as "historical fiction light" I felt it was safe to take a gamble on it.
Clearly this is a WWII saga, but at heart I felt this was a variety of love stories.
Please, even if (like me) you steer clear of historical fiction and love stories, do yourself a favor and pick this up.
But this “garden” is a fucking farm because in a 1940 French village it has chickens, rabbits (both plural), a stone wall covering all of it, a BARN with a car inside it, and ANOTHER cellar, a hill with a “hillside between the garden and the barn” and is so big that Isabelle can come in the middle of the night with three communists and move the car in the barn and hide a dead body and Vianne, inside at home, HEARS NOTHING.
For me this was a fusion of sub-literary chick lit and WWII fiction in that it was too cliche and melodramatic much of the time.
I thought the female perspective of occupied France and the tales of the resistance as well as the opposing sisters' perspectives were generally good ideas but the whole thing lacked in the execution.The tone of the book doesn't feel authentic to the time period and there are numerous unbelievable incidents and interactions.
The historical facts are covered but the atmosphere and characters feel too modern.
There are just too many dialogue and behavioral anachronisms.
You might have never heard of it, but in 1981 French author Régine Deforges released a book called La bicyclette bleue, 1939-1942 (part of a trilogy), which related the story of two sisters** during WWII in France.
This novel, many times bestseller in France, borrowed A LOT from Gone with the Wind, which led to many trials (that Régine Deforges won, in the end, saying that it was all part of "a game" with her editor - Where have I heard that before?
Tell me, really, I need to know how to multiply my funds like that (if that's explained later in the book, I apologize).
I don't even know where to start this review.
(Insert tissues here)My pick for Vianne when this becomes a movie is Naomi Watts or Kate Winslet and for Isabella is Julianne Hough or Amanda Seyfried.
I have so much more I could add but I will not because it would take so much of my review.This is a story that will make you cry and have hope in believing that if you keep stepping forward and never looking back you will make it.
I will cherish it always as it is now one of my top 3 favorites :)I'm looking forward to this movie becoming a film.
As the story transports to France, 1939, we are wondering about Juliette Gervaise...
We meet the Rosingal sisters: Vianne and Isabelle.
Vianne is 10 years older, married with a child....and lives in the country.
She is 18 at the start..and sent back home to live with her father in Paris.
When the Germans invade Paris, her father sends Isabelle to live with Vianne.
Isabelle and Vianne both have different perspectives and reactions to the injustices of war.
As the story moves on we see the sisters reconcile and/or at least acknowledge their differences.
“My nightingale, I got you home.”This review contains *spoilers*.I honestly didn't expect to like The Nightingale as much as I did.The premise of the book intrigued me (I've been really into historical fiction lately).
This story follows two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, during World War II and their hardships trying to survive.
Certainly she had been afraid sometimes, too; Isabelle would not let fear stand in her way.”Reading from Vianne’s point of view was just as nerve-wracking as reading from Isabelle’s.
Now I’m starting to get really emotional thinking about Vianne, especially thinking about her friendship with Rachel.
I almost didn't read this book and it would have been my loss if I didn't, because I would have missed out on knowing Isabel and Vianne , and the story of their indescribable bravery and volition to save lives in their roles in the French Resistance during WWII.
A recent article tells how Hannah based the story on real events and real people ."The subject of “The Nightingale” was an outgrowth of research Hannah had done for her earlier novel “Winter Garden,” when she came across information about a Resistance heroine — the 19-year-old Belgian woman Andrée de Jongh.
My Goodreads friend Evelyn said that by the end of the book she couldn't breathe.
its quite silly how i almost always go into a historical fiction book thinking, “why am i reading this? history is sooo boring.” but then i read books like this. books that remind me there are beautiful, heartbreaking, and important stories that make me a better person for reading them.and its difficult to write a review about story set during such a dark period in time, but this book truly is a must read for everyone. trust me. this is the kind of story that will stay with you long after you have read the final page. ↠ 4.5 stars
It was beyond amazing, beyond moving and it’s a story I will never forget.🇫🇷 📖I’m sure you’ve heard of this book.
It’s by far my favorite book of the year ( and if I’m honest I don’t think anything will top it.) and it will be a favorite for life.
It will change your life, it will make you sob, but it will make you hope and make you fall in love.SERIOUSLY READ IT RIGHT NOW!I probably won’t ever shut up about this book, sorry in advance.🌌Just kidding I’m not sorry, it’s amazing and everyone should read it.
Kristin Hannah is a pro in the chick-lit genre, and I applaud her efforts to break into historical fiction with The Nightingale.
When I read historical fiction in a war setting, I expect a certain rawness that just wasn't delivered here.
They felt like Hollywood characters: The perfect actresses who play the roles of average people.
Between the lines I read: "Oh yes, Mr. Nazi, you're irresistible, let's enjoy forbidden moments and fall in love, and hope the reader actually enjoys this bullsh!t."My complaints aside, I didn't rate this book too poorly because there were good parts.
Isabelle's character is based on the late Andrée de Jongh (1916-2007), an amazing woman who repeatedly risked her life helping British and American servicemen escape on foot from Nazi-occupied Belgium and France.
I cannot recommend this book highly enough.My favorite quote:“If I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are.”Note: Isabelle started out her life as an unruly child, but her tendency to rebel led to great things.
A moving, strong and inspiring tale of survival, love, and female heroism during World War II.Memoir and historical fictions are genres that I rarely visit. However, ever since last year after I finished reading the inspiring memoir by Yeonmi Park, I decided to at least read one book that revolves around war or its kind to remind myself to always be grateful. For that, The Nightingale is my pick of the year, and it ended up being one I will remember.  “If I have learned anything in this long lif
However, ever since last year after I finished reading the inspiring memoir by Yeonmi Park, I decided to at least read one book that revolves around war or its kind to remind myself to always be grateful.
The Nightingale, lean more towards the first example, and it’s exactly the kind of story I’m looking for in order to remind me to always be grateful for the life I have.
I don’t think I need to say a lot more on this review, all you have to know is that The Nightingale is a powerful tale about female power, nationalism, and most of all, the horror of war and how important love is.

Το υπέροχο λυπητερό κελάηδημα αυτού του αηδονιού με συγκλόνισε εξ αρχής, με αγκάλιασε και με ταξίδεψε σε ιστορικές διαδρομές γεμάτες φρίκη και πόνο με μοναδικό κίνητρο επιβίωσης την αγάπη και όπλο αντίστασης την δύναμη που κρύβουμε μέσα μας και δεν το γνωρίζουμε.

“Some stories don’t have happy endings. Even love stories. Maybe especially love stories.”  I know what a beloved book this is in the community. Recently, I did a blog post about the highest rated books on my TBR and The Nightingale was number one with a 4.55 average star rating, with 414,290 Ratings and 44,440 Reviews. Like, those are some powerful stats. But basically, after writing up that post, I knew that I had to read this beloved book and find out my thoughts on it. This is a heartbreak
This is a heartbreaking, historical fiction, WWII story that stars two sisters living in France, when the Germans take over in 1939.
And I’ll be honest, I feel like Isabelle makes sense to be my favorite sister, but her constant recklessness would put Vianne and her daughter, Sophie, in danger all throughout the book.
I don’t know, I just actually hated how his storyline ended and I didn’t care about this book near as much after it.
(Please don’t think I’m a horrible person.) Overall, this was a haunting but beautiful book about family and the things we are willing to sacrifice in the name of the ones we love.
A sad time.
This book focuses on the wives, the Mothers, the Daughters, the women left behind and the struggles they face.
The main characters in this book are two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle.
Years and distance separate them but both in their own way fight to stay alive, to keep others alive and to be free.Vianne is forced to take a German Commander into her home for lodging as her husband is being kept in a Nazi prison.
This book shows us how the Nazis took over France and ruled using fear and manipulation.
This book will break your heart but isn't that what war does?
In this book, the women are the heroes.Sad?
Yes, this book is sad.
I feel like I went on the journey with these characters, that I lived these years with them. It's a story I won't soon forget and definitely one that I hope to revisit in the future. An absolutely stunning book that I can't recommend highly enough. 5 stars
“In love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are.” This is a story that will stay with me for a long time to come. I think most people would agree, the best kind of books are those that evoke strong emotions and make you feel. Among my favorites are books that made me think about life, fall in love or ripped me to pieces and left me in tears. THE NIGHTINGALE managed to do  all  of those things.I’ve always had a fascination with World War II stories and with anything taking
Even though this book was beyond sad, I’m not exaggerating when I say I broke down, it was beautifully written and utterly captivating.The Nightingale is a story of two sisters, Vianne and Isabelle, from France, who find themselves in the midst of the Nazi invasion and the struggles of war.
Would I fight against the horror or sit back and follow the rules instead?Vianne, the oldest sister, lives in rural France with her husband and young daughter.
Vianne and Isabelle's story destroyed me.
I don’t think that I've ever found myself sobbing the way I did at the end of this book.
Vienne was much the same, but is more of a background character.Yes, there are moments and parts of this book that felt more genuine than others, and it isn’t that I felt any scenes were impossible or inaccurate.
This isn’t a history book, and I wasn’t concerned with historical accuracy as much as it just didn’t work for me as well as it did for others.
The real history haunts us, we read about it, hear stories about it, and we try to push it to the back of our minds, if momentarily, enough so we can go through our days, do the shopping, mow the lawn, go to work.
That’s not to say my heart wasn’t with Vianne too, because it was, it just took me longer to warm to her character – read this novel for yourself and you’ll see there’s no way you cannot fall in love with both women.This is a story of survival, rebellion, and redemption that recreates the time, place and horrors.
Kristin Hannah does ultimately deliver a big emotional moment at the end when the story is wrapped up and the identity of the surviving sister revealed.
4.5 to 5 stars - This is a very complete book. I hope that makes sense when I say it. I was satisfied with the entire experience.Emotional and at times nerve-wracking. Love and hope mixed with fear and suffering. Hard choices that are unavoidable, easy choices that come with great risk. This book is a historical fiction roller coaster ride.Even if you are not into historical fiction or WWII, I think this is worth checking out. Also, I would highly recommend it to those who enjoyed Between Shades of Gray and/or The Book Thief.
But this book was genuinely so sad, crafted in the most heart wrenching way, and I felt the knot of tears before I gulped it down.
We did what we had to during the war, and when it was over, we picked up the pieces and started our lives over.” ----------------------------IMMEDIATE FINISH REACTION- (and a bit of backstory)my heart is a bit of a mess right now- long story short, this book was overdue (yes, I’m that person) and I read the last 60 pgs skimming through, while my mom was speeding to the library.
MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListI finished this book in tears.
What is there left for me to say that I'm sure so many people have already said about this book.
I know this is a work of fiction but the truth is there in things that have happened.
But, I'm talking about THIS book.
All of these people they talk about in this book trying to survive.
To me, this book is about struggle, compassion you didn't know you could have, broken hearts and lives.
I'm just at a loss for words at how much this book touched my heart.
