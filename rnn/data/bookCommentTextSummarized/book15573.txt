Being a Harry Potter fan (actually, I rather hate the writing style but love the story) I quickly drove to my poorly stocked library and picked up the first book of the series.
Yes, children are used to reading such things, but taking the content of the Charlie Bone books into account, the kids reading them are at least able to understand what sentence variety is.
In my opinion, this book would have been much better had the author allowed her characters to speak for themselves, and if she’d varied her sentences to include compounds.Now, I have two other things I would like to mention that—so far—I haven’t seen mentioned in other reviews.
The trouble with Charlie Bone is he's much more like Charlie Bucket than Harry Potter and let's be honest--Jenny Nimmo is enthusiastically trying to channel some of Rowling's magic, so this is a bit of a problem.
As I've said before, the heroes of these series tend to fall into two camps: the Horatio Alger throwback (orphan/survivor with grit who eventually is rewarded for his selfless acts) and the preternaturally mature and intelligent youngster who makes the adults around him look like bumbling morons.
Even though he is not an orphan, Charlie Bone falls unmistakably in the former category.
This series unfortunately, just feels like a watered down replica.
My husband and I have been reading Harry Potter to him at night, and he is very enthusiastically following that story.
I would strongly recommend this as a pre-cursor to Harry Potter, to get children used to reading longer books and the basic idea of both: a child being mildly abused by the grown-ups (and a few of the kids) around him, finding a heretofore unknown sort of magic (both in the world, and within himself), and then emerging triumphant over the vast majority of the adversity (but saving a bit of it for future volumes).
Der beste re-read, den ich seit der Edelsteintrilogie hatte! Das Buch hat mich noch immer so verzaubert wie damals, mit 9. Allerdings hatte ich nahezu alle Szenen und die Welt noch sehr genau im Kopf. Werde dieses Universum auf ewig im Herzen tragen. <3
It does have some similarities to Harry Potter with the magical aspects and it being set in, I believe, England.
However, there are more non-magical people in these books and the school is run by bad people, so it's not necessarily a good place to be.
My 9-year-old daughter started reading this at school, so I thought I'd read them too to see what they're about.
I read this first book in about 3 days, very fast read.
I think these books will be a good starter point and stepping stone before my daughter starts the Harry Potter books.
A lot of people think Charlie Bone is a downright rip-off of Harry Potter.
It is obvious this book is for a young age, It even seems less dark and more basic then Harry Potter, So I would say it is a great book to start younger kids on.
However, I believe this book can be enjoyed by any age, as I am 18 years old and I still thoroughly enjoyed my time reading Charlie Bone.
This book is not at all as good as Harry Potter, but it's still a great adventure
Here's a review from my seven year old son - as he's the one who read it! "I liked Midnight For Charlie Bone because it was exciting and there were loads of secrets. At the end, it's nice when you find out what the secrets are. I liked the characters because they are very different. Olivia Vertigo was my favourite because she was weird! I didn't like that it didn't tell you what was in the ruin, because I wanted to know.
Lots of similarities with Harry Potter, but this series is targeted toward readers who are a bit younger.
Charlie Bone is a young boy who discovers that he can hear pictures talking.
Each book tends to focus on someone who has been held hostage by the evil members of the Bloor or Yewbeam families.
Charlie and the good endowed children rescue various victims from the bad endowed children.The Books:Midnight for Charlie BoneCharlie Bone and the Time TwisterCharlie Bone and the Invisible BoyCharlie Bone and the Castle of MirrorsCharlie Bone and the Hidden KingCharlie Bone and the Beast There are some good moments.
Charlie Bone has grown up knowing that his family is a little, okay a lot, different than most.
Now Charlie Bone has discovered an unusual gift-he can hear people in photographs talking!
His scheming aunts decide to send him to Bloor Academy, a school for genius's where he uses his gifts to discover the truth despite all the dangers that lie ahead.I really liked this book.
I got very tired of having people die in the Harry Potter series.
In this series, they don't die - they are found.
I also like the way each character has a different endowment.
I had to push the Harry Potter thought out of my head and start thinking Charlie Bone, because wherever I got that idea…I was wrong…and it was wrong of me to continue reading with that thought in my head.This was a slightly longer children’s book than normal, but it draw me in and captivated me from the beginning.
It felt “up-to-date” and that was enough for me.Reading this book showed the writer in me that whilst characters need to learn and grow throughout a story, their problems don’t have to be resolved completely.
I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed Charlie Bone yet! Growing up, I loved Charlie Bone ever so slightly more than Harry Potter. There are so many characters to fall in love with and it’s such a fantastic story. I hunted down all 8 volumes and while they’re all different editions, they no longer print them so it’s what I have to make do with. If you have a kid slightly too young for Harry Potter (the later books are rather dark and violent), then this is always the first series I recommend.
K. Rowling Harry Potter books.
It's obvious that Jenny Nimmo based her plot outline on the first Harry Potter book, but who cares?
Rowling summarily lifted the plot & most of the goings-on in "Sorcerer's Stone" from the book "Mary Poppins" by P.
I think there are probably many new things under the sun, but no one in the 21st century has the guts to put it out there because they're too busy falling back on the tried-and-true million-copy-selling ideas.Ms. Nimmo's first book in the Charlie Bone series is much more appropriate for young people than any of the Rowling books that are put out there as "for children" (which they most certainly are not).
If I was rating this book as though adults were the audience, it'd likely warrant 3 stars. But this book isn't written for adults. I would recommend this book to 10 -13 year olds. Keeping in mind that age range, it isn't a bad read. There are flaws. Characters are either good guys or bad guys. Overall, the book is VERY derivative of Harry Potter in a manner that is almost laughable. But ignoring that and keeping in mind the intended age-group, it is a fun and exciting adventure.
I read the first three books in this series years ago. There are quite a few more now so I’m rereading the books I have already read first.The Red King. Yewbeams. Three evil sisters. Children with magical powers including hypnotism, hearing conversations in photographs, and flying. Three magical fiery cats. One yellow. One orange. One red.A school. Part evil. Part good.Onward to book two...
I got less than half-way through this book and had to put it down.How this came to be a successful series I don't know. The writing is god awful, the story as unoriginal as you can get, and the characters are all unbelievably dense.
Charlie a bit like Harry feels that it is his duty to help solve all the bad things that are happening at the Bloor's academy.
As great as Harry Potter is the older books might not be age appropriate for younger children.
So I Loved this book because it was a great read plus younger kids like my little cousin could enjoy it.
I couldn't help but compare this book to the Harry Potter series, as it has many of the same elements like children with supernatural abilities going to a special private school.
Mein Favorit aus der Kindheit (neben Harry Potter natürlich😉).
Here's the thing: Charlie is, in the context of this story, a descendent of the Red King.
Yes, the Red King could have come from a section of Africa that was colonized by a European nation.
Nimmo did a great job of setting us up for the sequel by leaving us with a Charlie who is determined to wake his father, who was assumed to be dead (hide spoiler)]I love that Charlie has Benjamin as a friend, and I love how loyal Charlie is toward Benjamin and his dog, Runner Bean.
Also: a dog named Runner Bean- what a fantastic little detail to include in a story!
Charlie convinces himself that he imagined it, but Grandma Bone has her own theory.
His grandma enrolls him at Bloor’s Academy, a school for gifted children.
She thinks that Charlie is endowed with special abilities.
Charlie doesn’t want to go to any special school.
Life at Bloor’s is different, and soon Charlie discovers that there are other students in his class who have equally mysterious powers.
The people in the photo and a mysterious gift set Charlie hot on the trail to solve a mystery of a missing girl.
Can Charlie find her at his school?
A magically gifted boy away at boarding school.
Harry Potter may be all over this book, but it has to be said that Charlie Bone does have some originality.
The style is relatively simplistic, but that doesn't stop this from being an enjoyable read.
The characters aren't all that interesting, though Charlie Bones ties to the school and his past offer intriguing set up for future books.
It's lack of originality stops this from getting any higher than three stars, but i did enjoy it and it's great for middle grade readers who enjoyed Potter and are looking for another world to explore.
This book/series is just as great as I remember thinking it was when I first picked it up in middle school.
I mean, a main character with dark, messy hair that people complain about.
A family full of ginger-haired, freckled-faced people.
Maybe it was drawing inspiration but I know this might annoy a few people so I feel the need to point it out.
I think this was always the part of the draw for me, though, why I was so invested in it in the first place.
It's a great series, especially for middle grade students.
Another one kind of hard to rate.I didn't love the book in the beginning.
From there on, I didn't love the book in the beginning.
Once we started to meet the people in the academy, though, it really got going and I went all in.There was something about the writing that felt, for lack of a better word, clunky all the way through.
Those gripes didn't bog me down too much though, because I really loved most of the characters and the plot in general was very good, not to mention I am highly intrigued for things that are sure to come in future books.A good, solid read.
I won't be surprised if the series gets better from here out though.
I got to page 167 and I couldn't finish it. The characters in this story are so mean that it's not even an enjoyable story. Part of the lure of reading a book is enjoying the world that the characters live in - being in a world different from your own. I don't want to be in Charlie Bone's world! His world sucks. There is nothing in this story that makes me want to finish it. I was really looking forward to this book so I'm pretty disappointed with the outcome.
This was a beloved book series from my childhood that I recently decided to pick up and re-read.
In that way, it reminded me of the Harry Potter series, where you pick up the book and become acquainted with all the characters and get warm fuzzies just thinking about them.Granted, this is a middle grade book and there are definitely times when this comes across with the dialogue and such.
But all in all, this is a damn good middle grade novel, and one that I personally think is vastly under-appreciated.
Charlie then discovers a hypnotized child being held in a photograph against her will by Manfred's diabolical schemes with his own power (hypnosis).
Charlie and his new friends then set out on their quest to end this regime.This story is great to pass time and to enjoy, especially sense it is in a series offering plenty of action and adventure.
This is a fantasy based book with quest like adventure, as well as magic.
I honestly think this is a decent book to read, especially sense it covers a few genres adding onto the fun.
So my sister was able to read Harry Potter right when it came out.
Being a few years younger, I was so happy when the Charlie Bone series came out.
I started reading the series and anticipated each new book as the series unfolded...
around the fifth book, however, I stopped reading.
Now that the books are all out and done, I want to finish the series.
But I'm into it still and will press forward through this next week and a bit to complete the series!
2,5/5 stars.Unfortunately I didn't love this book. Everybody comparing this to Harry Potter. I don't see the resemblance. And most of all, I didn't got into the story. Everthing was left at the surface and up to now I didn't got to know the characters enough. Maybe this'll get better in the next books of the series, but I don't think I will continue this series.
I just can't stop with nostalgic childhood throwbacks
i love reading these books. i love the adventures that happen and the friendships that are formed between some of the characters is great.
My 10 year old recommended this one and I can see why.There’s certainly a Harry Potter vibe to it, plus maybe a few other popular books, yet is still distinguishable in its own right. All in all, it’s pretty good for a middle grade book.
