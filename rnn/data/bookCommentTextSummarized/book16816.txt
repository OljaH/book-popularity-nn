There's an old adage that Halloween allows you to be your true self for one night a year, and all of the other 364 days you're wearing society's costume. This year Carly Beth decides to show who she is inside, or at least the person her tormenters have turned her into: a monster. It is this mask that calls out to her essence, and she craves to put her victim persona aside for once.The mask bonds with her skin, but is it really the mask or Carly Beth who won't let go of her new identity?
#11 "If looks could kill...."Carly Beth has no idea what she wants to be for Halloween. But she knows it needs to be really scary. When she finds an old mask at a nearby party store she begs the man to let her buy the mask despite his reluctance. Everything seems good and scary at first, but when Carly Beth starts getting strange thoughts while wearing the mask and even has trouble getting it off, things start to get really creepy! I remember this one. Still great!
***Re-read for Goosebumpsalong!Just as fun, scary and crazy as I remember it. Can't wait to watch the 2 part episode this weekend. :)
هذا العدد على وجه التحديد كان أكثر الأعداد رُعباً لي وأنا صغير عندما قرأتها لأول مرة..وأفضل ما في قراءة العدد بعد سنين طويلة.. هو أنني بعد كل تلك السنين أتابع سير القصة بكل شغف لأصل للنهاية التي أعلم أن شتاين لن يجعلها نهاية عادية.وتبقى هذه السلسلة هي من أعطتني الجرأة والإقدام وحُب روايات الرُعب والتشويق والإثارة.
This book will always get a 5 from me! 💀🖤
This reminds me of that episode of Buffy where a curse--or a spell, or something, whatever it was--turns everyone into whatever they're dressed as for Halloween.
And without the benefit of Giles getting all unexpectedly hot at the end and laying the smackdown.
What I really liked, though, was that, unlike on Buffy, where the trick-or-treaters of Sunnydale are changed because of the whims of The Bad Guy, Carly Beth is really the victim of her own inner demons.
If she hadn't been so intent on being something she wasn't, scary and mean, and getting revenge on Chuck and Steve, she never would have put on that mask.
The man at the store warns her that she'll regret buying one of the scary masks he keeps in the hidden back room - but Carly Beth won't be dissuaded.
The man reluctantly sells her the mask, and Carly Beth plans a fright night of epic revenge.First, her little brother.
It only became scary (to me) when she starts to realize that she can't get the mask off - she might stay this way permanently.I thought the explanation was beyond ridiculous, but then again, this is R.L. Stine, what do I expect?
LoLCarly Beth is easily frightened and is teased because her friends think it's funny.
This Halloween, it's her turn to scare Chuck & Steve.
She finds the perfect mask and gets the thrill of scaring not only Chuck & Steve, but also random people.
Unfortunately, there is one complication that she did not forsee that could make it so she could never take off the mask.The book was a bit different than the episode I have on VHS.
For one, in the book, Chuck & Steve are her friends.
The episode is pretty close to the novella.
One of Stines' really good books.
Carly Beth's "friends" were little assholes, that's all you need to know.
loved this one! action packed, tons of Halloween vibes, and a character i could easily relate to.
There was a girl named Carly Beth staying along with her friend Sabrina.Every one liked to scare Car
I lied when I said Night of the Living Dummy was my favorite GB book. The Haunted Mask is. I forgot how freaky this one was. You could really get the feeling that the mask was changing poor Carly Beth. What a great Halloween read.
Ayant récemment acheté une réplique du fameux masque hanté, que j'ia trouvé sur internet, j'ai décidé de me replonger dans ce classique de mon enfance.
Les enfants peuvent lire de «l'horreur» et avoir un peu peur, plusieurs aiment cela et si cela peut leur donner le goût de lire que ce fut le cas pour moi alors...
Des fins de chapitres qui donnent toujours le goût de lire le suivant et une fin incroyable.
Peut-être que mon appréciation est tout aussi nostalgique que littéraire, mais j'ai adoré!!Merci à R.
L. Stine pour avoir su agrémenter mon enfance de manière aussi incroyable!
TAGLINE: IT LOOKS COULD KILL.This stand second among the list of my favorite goosebumps book series!
:)R.L. Stine's 'The Haunted Mask' is the eleventh book in the series of the higly-acclaimed Goosebumps.
This book follows a girl named Carly Caldwell who was teased of being the most unscary girl in the block when it comes to halloween costumes and the like.
So, Carly founds herself at a Halloween store and buys a downright scary looking mask, little does she know that after putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and ominously.
I'm going to review my experience with the entire Goosebumps universe within this book because I have such strong memories of "The Haunted Mask" TV episode (which you can, of course, now watch on YouTube).R.L. Stine is a master of children's horror and most likely responsible for popularizing the genre.
My family owned at least a hundred of his books, all lined up in a rainbow of horror.
Goosebumps is a universe that shaped not only my childhood reading experience, but also my storytelling interests and writing style in subconscious ways.
Thank you, R.L. Stine, for your work.
Αυτή την ιστορία σίγουρα δεν την διάβασα όταν ήμουν μικρός.
Αυτή έχει βαρεθεί να γελάνε εις βάρος της.
Όμως, ήρθε η ώρα της να πάρει εκδίκηση.
Και ποια είναι πιο ιδανική μέρα για εκδίκηση από την μέρα του Χάλογουιν; Θα αγοράσει την πιο τρομακτική και ανατριχιαστική μάσκα που θα βρει και θα προσπαθήσει να αιφνιδιάσει τους φίλους της.
Όμως τι γίνεται όταν η μάσκα που θα αγοράσει είναι κάπως...
ζωντανή; Ιδανική ιστορία τρόμου για παιδιά ηλικίας έντεκα-δώδεκα ετών, ενδιαφέρουσα, ατμοσφαιρική και ευκολοδιάβαστη.
Δεν χρειάζεται να πω κάτι παραπάνω, ό,τι ισχύει για τα υπόλοιπα βιβλιαράκια της σειράς "Ανατριχίλες", το ίδιο ισχύει και γι'αυτό (7/10).
Just reading this one for nostalgia's sake. This is one of those books though that seems great when you're twelve, but that loses its spark by the time you're eighteen. Still though, this book and the others in the Goosebumps series were a big inspiration to me as a kid. :)
Five starts just for nostalgia. I love this book when I was a kid :D.
"Face to face with a nightmare!"  A girl name Carly gets picked on for being a scaredy-cat. Tired of everyone mocking her, she decides for Halloween she's going to get the scariest costume around. I liked it. It wasn't the best thing in the world, but it was entertaining enough. I felt it did drag in some places, and Carly's tendency to get scared is annoying. But overall, not too bad. 2.75 frights outta five!
I remember seeing this as a TV episode years ago. I forgot how irritating Carly Beth was.
This is a first time read for me of this author and this is a middle grade book/series.SynopsisSomething scary is happening in GOOSEBUMPS HORRORLAND, the all-new, all-terrifying series by R.
but it won't budge!Halloween is almost over, but fright night is just beginning.Now with all-new bonus materials!I think this would be a pretty scary read for most Middle Graders.
It was a very quick read with quite the cliffhanger at the end which is one of the parts that I found to be somewhat predictable.The characters are fun in this story, and since this is a series I would think that they are developing more with each book that comes in the series.
Από τις πλέον αγαπημένες μου ιστορίες των "Ανατριχίλων". Σίγουρα σε κάποιον ενήλικα, το όλο story, δεν θα φανεί ιδιαίτερα πρωτότυπο -εφόσον υπάρχει και σχετική θεματολογική ταινία του cult κινηματογράφου-, αλλά ας μην ξεχνάμε σε τι ηλικίες απευθύνεται η σειρά. Και οι ηλικίες αυτές, αν μη τι άλλο, θα πάθουν την πλάκα τους, θα νιώσουν τον τρόμο και την αγωνία στο πετσί τους και θα σκεφτούν πως καμιά φορά ίσως δεν πρέπει να εύχεσαι δυνατά αυτό που θες.
This is cute and probably terrifying to small children.
Another great scary tale from R. L. Stine! It felt good when the poor bullied girl scared the crap out of her tormentors - and not so good when she was trapped in THE HAUNTED MASK! Great story!More detailed review in Bulgarian here:http://citadelata.com/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0...
"Sabrina se llevó las manos a la cara, con los rasgos desfigurados por el terror. —¡Es absurdo! ¡Absurdo! —repetía Carly Beth con voz aterrada. Pero al explorar desesperadamente su cuello con dedos temblorosos se dio cuenta de que su amiga tenía razón. La máscara ya no tenía borde inferior. No terminaba en ningún sitio. No existía espacio entre la máscara y la piel de Carly Beth. La máscara se había convertido en su rostro."
One of the first goosebumps books I've ever read when I was a child. Scared the heck out of me LOL.
Suddenly, Carly Beth is breaking rules and terrorizing the neighborhood, almost as if the mask is turning her into a real monster.This is one of Stine’s better contributions to the series, with fewer places where the plot veers off into ridiculousness.
The premise is straightforwardly scary: having a monster mask permanently stuck on your face is nightmarish, but it’s surprisingly insidious for adult readers as well.
I found the ending where she’s chased by a bunch of bobbing, bodiless horror masks a little over the top, but I vaguely remember being frightened by it as a kid.
Wanting to get revenge on her friends on Halloween night, she decided to find herself the scariest mask in order to scare the two boy who always make her scream like a jerk at school.
Seeing the custom which was made by her mom looks not scary at all, she went to a shop to buy a mask instead of wearing her mom duck's custom.
However, when she went at the back of the shop, she surprisingly saw the mask she surely wanted, the creepy and real-looking monster mask.
Grab the book and read it!
Constantly tormented by bullies, Carly Beth seeks out a spine-tingling, blood-curdling mask.
People exploited Carly Beth’s tendency towards being easily frightened, which led to her wanting to embody fright and horror through a frightening mask.
The mask took on a life of itself, however, and Carly Beth’s personality transformed.
I think this change was Carly Beth’s way of dealing with being bullied.This was one of my favourite books in the Goosebumps series as a child.
I recall reading most of Stine’s books late at night and all alone in my room!
This is definitely one of Stine’s better books.
This book was just average to me. Carleybeth was just so annoying that it made it hard to like most of the book. I do like the premis of the book and thought the storeowner was very well done.
