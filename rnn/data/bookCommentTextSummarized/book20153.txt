For one, I felt that the author was writing in the way that some adults speak to younger children - not as young people, but as idiots.
I felt it was written more for 6 year old than a 9-12 year old - and can only wonder if I would've been offended while reading this at 12 since the tone, to me, felt so patronizing.The other annoying thing was the way that the "Magykal" words were capitalized and bolded.
It's another one of those things that makes me feel like the author thinks children are idiots - let's make sure they don't miss this special, important words!
Magyk (Septimus Heap, #1), Angie SageMagyk (an archaic spelling of "Magic") is a fantasy novel written by English author Angie Sage.
It is the first book in the seven-book Septimus Heap series.
The book cover of Magyk alludes to the diary that the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia makes for her apprentice, Septimus Heap.
This was pretty good. A nice, quick, easy read that kept me entertained. I especially enjoyed the whimsical tone throughout. I would have liked to see a bit more emotional depth and moral ambiguity from the characters though. This book doesn't really "go there." Also a tad long for middle grade. Still, a good read, especially for kids, I'm sure.
Things from the book came back to me as I read them.
Septimus Heap was taken away as a newborn child with the nurse saying he was dead...he was not.
It's such a fun book with all of the little magical things like the Shield Bugs, they are so cool and I want a group of them of my own!
There are just so many things to like about this book.
They have to face a bunch of junk trying to keep away from the bad guys that just want to get Jenna back.
But in his pockets he had the herbs that Galen, the Physik Woman, had given him for his new baby boy, Septimus, who had been born earlier that day.It was then that Silas sensed something nearby.
Thinking of his Sarah at home, warm and safe with Septimus and the boys, Silas decided that they would just have to make room for one more little one.
Magyk by Angie Sage and narrated by Allan Corduner had me on tenterhooks as it began with the opening bars of dramatic music, then as the music slowly fades out as the words of the first chapter can be heard.
You think the book will star Septimus Heap, but then it switches to a girl named Jenna, and only at the end does the boy Septimus really make any choices or become important at all.
And you’re in the head of way too many adult characters, not to mention the guard bugs (which admittedly were funny, but I don’t think I really needed their thought processes in such detail).
Another problem was that new characters showed up in every chapter, resulting in more distractions from forming a bond with the main character (whoever that was supposed to be).
REVIEW: MAGYK by Angie SageI have just read and enjoyed ‘Magyk’ by Angie Sage. It is the story of Septimus Heap, a wizard apprentice. I noticed a few similarities to my own Spook’s Series. For example both Tom Ward and Septimus Heap are both seventh sons of seventh sons. Also pointy shoes are mentioned and a boggart features! Of course there are differences too. Angie Sage’s book features wizards who are wielders of magic. In my books the Spook and his apprentice practise a craft and use salt an
It is the story of Septimus Heap, a wizard apprentice.
For example both Tom Ward and Septimus Heap are both seventh sons of seventh sons.
Angie Sage’s book features wizards who are wielders of magic.
In my books the Spook and his apprentice practise a craft and use salt and iron and rowan wood to counter the dark magic of their opponents.
It will be interesting to explore this further and I will be doing so on Sunday, 4th October, 10 am at the Bath Festival where Angie and I will be answering questions and comparing books.Joseph Delaney.
How annoying, to write a book about a young wizard right in the midst of Harry Potter mania!
There's less suspense and many breaks for play and mundane activities that slow the forward momentum enough to let small children relax after a scary chase or a bad turn of events.
Being attacked by a scary wizard in a deadly boat?
As a thirty-something, I can say that while I could enjoy reading this story aloud to an 8- to 10-year-old, it was too young for me to enjoy on my own.
Eine süße und toll erzählte Geschichte - aber leider nicht meins. Im direkten Vergleich haben mir die Chroniken von Anbeginn besser gefallen. Das Buch hat für mich auch nichts mit Harry Potter zu tun! Aber das nur am Rande - hat nichts mit meiner Bewertung zu tun, hab das nur des Öfteren in anderen Rezensionen gelesen!
It took me a few more chapters than I would have liked to "get into" the story and the characters, but after a while I found that I did feel invested.
I think I got a pretty good understanding by the middle of the book though, so again, it didn't bother me too much.
There is one part at the end that's pretty unsettling, but the fact it's rectified makes it less so.A few character traits were somewhat irksome, but again, I'm hoping that the author delves into these in the next books (this book did a good job, so I'm trusting that the author will continue in a similar fashion).Some things were predictable, but others surprising.
Amazingly good written. Clever, funny, and magical.

Fleeing the town late at night with the ExtraOrdinary wizard Marcia and narrowly escaping a hunter, the Heap family (plus one child soldier) go their separate ways to avoid danger.And from then on, this book is a whole load of fun.
I didn't know anything about what DomDaniel was plotting, Stanley's ordeal in prison, the Supreme Custodian's role in ruling the Castle and its town, Sarah and the other boys running through the forest, and what about that poor woman whose pub was burned down by the Hunter and his gang?
Sadly, when I actually got to reading the book, I was incredibly disappointed.First of, absolutely none of the characters are lovable - or eve likable.
The only reason I continued until the end was because I don't like the idea of leaving a book unfinished (except for Twilight because that book was too horrible to continue.) Fourth, I hate the creatures Sage created/portrayed.
I absolutely hate how the Boggart was described.
If you want to get into some serious reading with captivating characters, impressive story line, magical(not magykal)creatures, and grand adventures...
Reviewed by Me for TeensReadToo.comIf you've been looking for a series that combines the magic of Harry Potter with the imaginative characters of Artemis Fowl, then Septimus Heap and his first book, MAGYK, is definitely the story for you.
As the Heap family attempt to ride out this time of darkness, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, learns of the plot to kill the Princess, which will allow evil to truly take over the Palace.
As events unfold and DomDaniel does everything within his power to track down the girl standing between him and a ruling darkness, the Heap family will have to do everything within their means to stop him--and at the same time stay alive.
Of course one could draw paralells between this book and Harry Potter.
Rats to send verbal messages instead of owls etc.
I find the book creative, cute and funny.
How can you not like pens that can write in any color--if they are in good mood.Or a pet rock named Petroc Trelawney, which mostly sleeps but you need to feed it and take for a walk daily.
And you can write your magical ideas on anything.
Even on "(preferably unbuttered) toast."Even though the point of view is omniscent, I really got to like Jenna and especially the hapless Boy 412.

Example:Roughly a page in, we are told how Silas Heap finds a baby in the snow, smuggles her in through the city gates, and is accosted by the new Grand High Poobah, who warns him to raise the child as his own.
You cannot tear them asunder!” To which GHP replies, “Remember that time when you found a baby in the snow, smuggled her in through the city gates, and saw me, and I warned you to raise her as your own?””Oh yeah!
I will read 25 more pages because I love books and want to grant each one of them equal opportunity to win my heart.
Children should read this book as a lesson of what a novel should not be.
The plot is pathetic and weak, careening all over the place without ever forming into a cohesive story line.
Their story is never all that interesting in the first place, but the fact that they manage to drag it out for such an insufferable length of time just makes it all the more wearying.
I don’t see this story holding the attention of children, and given this, I see them getting extremely lost in the convoluted plot.
There is far superior reading choices out there for children to read.
classic example of choosing a book based on its prominent display location. I saw it was a series, sounded interesting, so I got it. While only begun, it is a fun read so far.and now, the verdict is, in the words of Simpson's everywhere: Meh.mildly entertaining, annoying  bold, italic , misspelled  wordes . The story is ok, but nothing gripping. I actually left it for weeks with only a few pages at the end.While it wasn't a "bad" book, per se, it isn't one I can recommend at all.
4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this, it was such a fun read.
I'm not saying this book was terrible, the story was quite good, however the world just seemed very undeveloped and it just felt 'meh' reading it the whole time.
And Simon seemed like a deeper character, he turned a lot more interesting towards the end.
And seriously, the main character of a book should be introduced properly for the majority of the story, this just felt weird to be honest.
Seriously the only interesting characters were Boy 412, or Septimus, the Apprentice (who you find out to be Merrin at the end) and Simon, the oldest Heap son.
I think I'm old for this book. (not this kind tho, I love magic stories.)if you are a fan, don't read the rest. you've been Warned.--too boring, too slow-pace story, too detailed unimportant events (like 7 pages to explain just sliding down through trashes!!???) some NonSenSe descriptions about some new invented animals. & some disgusting things happening there.2 stars because of first 9 seasons & season 50 at the end.I don't think I will continue this series. I feel sorry because covers are beautiful.
Jenna is the child adopted by the Heap family at the start of the book after Silas finds her in the snow and learns of the death of his son; Jenna is raised as one of the family and only learns her true identity later on in the book.
Sarah is the mother; she tries to help her children and their father in this book but ultimately struggles as they continually get away from her.The storyline is original and gripping with very likeable characters and a building sense of danger that will most probably be explored in the rest of the series.
Septimus Heap, the seventh son of the seventh son, disappears the night he is born, pronounced dead by the midwife.
That same night, the baby's father, Sila Heap, comes across and abandoned child in the snow--a newborn girl with violet eyes.
The Heaps take her into their home, name her Jenna, and raise her as their own.
But whois this mysterious baby girl, andwhat really happened to their beloved son Septimus?

Prvo da napomenem ova knjiga je pisana za relatiovno mladu populaciju, po mojoj proceni do 12 ili 14 godina starosti.
World building je veoma slab, tek tolko da se dobije neka ideja a čak ni magični sistem nije previše objašnjen iako se jako puno vrti oko njega.Nema dosadnih momenata, nema ekspozicije i svet se drži sopstvenih pravila što je uvek plus tako ako vam treba štivo za čitaoce u razvoju ovo je odličan način da ih privuče.
I taman da budu spremni za Harija Potera :)PS: da sam jedno 20tak godina mladji ocena bi bila pre oko 4 ili 5.
I enjoyed this despite the fact that:a) It was a tad on the slow side.b) It gives a really weird introduction to the world, magyk and everything else in general. c) For the most part, nothing happens.This series is in the “what to read after Harry Potter” lists and is the principal reason why I wanted to read it. While it’s a fun book, it’s certainly nothing like Harry Potter. I felt a little underwhelmed by it all. The world of the book and the magyk in it doesn’t feel very cohesive and well-de
c)	For the most part, nothing happens.This series is in the “what to read after Harry Potter” lists and is the principal reason why I wanted to read it.
While it’s a fun book, it’s certainly nothing like Harry Potter.
The world of the book and the magyk in it doesn’t feel very cohesive and well-defined to me yet.
I guessed it after but did not expect it so that was new.I would like the series to mature and darken a little.
Overall, I feel it’s an extremely entertaining book but it barely scratches the surface.

One word for you: CLICHE
Action packed climax: BAD yet; Interesting Ending: GOODI loved the whole ancient history and the Hotep-Ra ring and all, but before that, too much was going on but felt not rich as the start of the novel...may be for the not that strong villain theme..
this one have some bits felt so...IDK, may be children appreciate it more..or just I'm seriously getting too old.Yet, again the sense of humour in the writing style, the rich world and the promising ending sure will make me start book two sooner than I expected.Mohammed ArabeyFrom 12 December 2018To 14 December 2018
It just felt like the author knew about her serious problem (aka lack of a hero), so she tried to throw in all these "crazy" characters to make up for it.Story wise, it's just mediocre.
And previously mentioned character problems really prevented that from happeningReading on my nook, I was confused when I would happen across a word like, "Flyte" and it would be capitalized.
I then found out in the actual book, those words are also  bolded  to show emphasis on  Magykal  spells and whatnot.
If you're reading the book you already know what the spells are, there's no need for it.
