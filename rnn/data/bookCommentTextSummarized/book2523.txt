Good...but definitely not my favorite GLH novel.
Poor Duskin.I love the character of Carol in this particular book.
Here's something quite radical for the time period this was written in - a young woman who is taking on the authority of an entire project, who is trying to call the shots, and is showing the men how it's done.
Ooooh, but I liked this pairing.I love to see how Grace shows us that the modern woman (for her time anyway) can still be a strong Christian, but can also be a success in business.
Another of my favorites. The mystery in this one was great!
I read A LOT of GLH's books when I was younger and really enjoyed them.
So I was excited to see some on sale recently for my Kindle app.
I couldn't remember if I had read this one or not and thought it would be interesting because it sounded like the heroine would be a strong business woman.
It took me several tries to finish the book.
I didn't totally dislike the book but I didn't love it.
But I still have very fond memories of reading and enjoying GLH's books so I will definitely try another one.
Grace Livingston Hill is my guilty pleasure...Duskin is one of my favorites!
Not really a huge fan of Grace Livingston Hill, but I really enjoyed this one! The romance was so sweet, and the action scenes were impeccable!
