Look, everything you need to know about Victorian spiritualism is contained in this book.
On the other hand, it is a turgid read.
No way could I wade through the endless lists of names of those who either did or didn't support the featured mediums.
I'm sorry to any spirits who are observing my writing of this, and no disrespect to you (!) but the book was hard-going to put it mildly.
It is fascinating though how spiritualism took off in Europe (and indeed America) during this time and the amount of 'supernatural' phenomena that was apparently witnessed.
This is a superbly written and extremely detailed history of the early days of modern Spiritualism.
It discusses all the major mediums of the late 1850's through the early 1900's.
It traces the growth of the movement from America through England.
In those day Spiritualism's primary goal was to prove that communication with departed Spirits was possible.
To this end, many mediums agreed to work with interested scientists, thus psychical research also began.
This book also discusses the work of an early psychical researcher, William Crookes.
It is an excellent book on the subject!
I have enjoyed Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books for decades. This one won't disappoint you.
Interesting
Ber√ºhrend in seiner Ernsthaftigkeit
Facts I read this for a class but it was very interesting. The facts are astounding. One wonders why belief didn't follow.
Well written. He really tries to be objective. But Conan Doyle was a believer, and even in his writings you get the suspicion that most of these people were con artists.
