Ma kakav biomoj rodni prag,on mi je ipakmio i drag.Prost je i skroman,ali je moj,tu sam slobodani gazda svoj.
In case that somebody is interested here's the publisher's address http://www.istrosbooks.com/products/b...Povratak u djetinjstvo, baš sam pogledala na youtube i ima vezija ove priče, baš lijepo.
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aluerg...)Prekrasna i poučna priča za djecu.
No, dobro možda je više problem što se djeci ne čita i ne potiče ih se da čitaju, još ima lijepih priča sigurna sam i novijih, a i da nema bilo bi pregršt starijih.
Dobro, sad već zvuči kao da pametujem, ali meni je bilo lijepo čitati u djetinjstvu i da mi čitaju baš ovakve priče, I.B. Mažuranić i slično...neka i današnja djeca uživaju u tome...
Meni se jako svidjelo u pjesnici kad se sve rimuje i tako lijep izraz pisca ja toj knjizi sam dala sve 5 zvijezdie ja bi joj dala ne 5 nego 100 ako treba to je prava pjesmica i knjiga👏👏👏👌👌👍❣😝😋😜

If you didn't know this book by heart, oooo, you suck! I think every elementary school had a recital competition with this one.Mental pictures from their dinners are still in my head. Loved it, still so so love it.
Kada sam bila mladja i dok mi je majka citala ovu pricu, nikada nisam ni pomislila da cu sa tolikom radoscu da joj se vracam i dan danas. Ne zasluzuje samo " 5 zvezdica " kao najbolju ocenu, to nije bitno iskreno. Bitno je da svako dete zasluzuje da upozna poznatog jeza, staroga lovca.
Zgođušno i pitoreskno, izuzev stereotipnog, rasističkog ocrtavanja (karikiranja) vuka, medvjeda i svinje (;
This poem is about a hedgehog and his love for his humble home and I, as many, read it to my younger cousins and nephew so many times that I memorized it.
It rhymes and it's very catchy.
I attempted to translate it, but it's right down impossible.
Much is lost to translation.
NOTE: this is my attempt not an official translation, if there's one.
FAMOUS HUNTERThrough out forest,Without path,Without way,Hedgy Hedgehog,Wanders all day.
Hunting fills his days,He's spotted often, With three hundred arrows,He's charging his pray.
And wolf, And bear, and even dog, know well this famous hunter, Hedgy Hedgehog.
Књига је веома интересантна, поучна и уживам док је читам.
When I was little, we had this on vinyl! They always played it for me on my uncle's old record player... Beautiful memories - twelve years later, I can still recite it by heart.
This is a just beautiful tale.It is a fun little story about Hedgehog (who doesn't like hedgehogs) and importance of ones home (no matter is it poor or rich)One might look for an allegory about Tito - Stalin split.But in the end, this is just an amazing work of art.Branko Ćopić and Ježeva kućica should be more famous.Will end with the best parts of the book:To samo hulje, nosi ih vrag,Za ručak daju svoj rodni prag!Po šumi danas, bez staze, putaJežurka Ježić lovi i luta.Vještak i majstor u poslu svom radi i čuva rođeni dom
My Grandfather brought me this book when he visited from Bosna when I was a kid, and I loved it so much as a child even though I didn't know čirilica very well and my dad had to help me along. I had forgotten all about this book in the past couple years but suddenly was reminded when I was painting a fox and remembered the Miss Fox from the story. It'll stay with me forever, it's fricken magnificent.
This one was my first at the age of 3, i got it for Christmas and i read it immediately. 25 years later and i remember every single word. Secrets are well kept in the playground. As simple as it gets.
<3šta reći :)
Meni jedna od najdražih dječijih knjiga, uvijek je rado čitam.
Jednoga dana, videli nismo, Jezic je, kazu, dobio pismo...:)
My parents used to read this to me constantly when I was little, and I still remember some of the verses by heart. So many beautiful memories....I just love this story so much :)))
I didn't get every single word, but it's a harmless little tale for children. Nice.
"Po šumi, širom,. bez staze, puta, Ježurka Ježić povazdan luta." Is there a person in Croatia that read at least two books, and doesn't know these verses? I don't think so.
Ovo je priča mojeg djetinjstva i još uvijek mi je jedna od najdražih, sigurna sam kao i ostalima moje generacije. Iako se jako malo toga sjećam iz vremena dok sam bila mala, jedna od uspomena mi je kako mi mama čita ovo priču (po vjerojantno doslovno 100. put)! :D
Exactly 25 years ago I read this book as a three year old girl. We had it on the record also, and I was listening it tirelessly. Since that day my favorite animal is hedgehog.English title is Hedgehog's Home by Branko Copic
This has been my favourite book when I was a child. My mom used to read it to me before going to sleep, thus it immediately brings back my childhood memories. Also, the drawing are right on point!
Čitali mu :)
I like that there is a bear there. It's my favourite animal. The rabbit was bringing the mail, too.
Hedgehog’s HomeOne sunny day, so the story is toldHedgemond was given a letter so boldSweet words we
Seksualne tenzije između Lije i Ježa su vrhunac ove knjige.
Last night I read this to my daughter and she was thrilled!However, in this paper and older elementary school students could learn a lot, and they probably have already forgotten this story - I have a new challenge! :-)
I am never ever done with this beautiful children's book I got for my first Christmas. Still know it by heart, loving it; it's one of my fondest childhood memories. If I ever have a kid of my own, I will read this to him/her.
Tako je lijepo prisjetiti se djetinjstva. Čitajući ovo, osjetila sam se tako opuštenom i osmijeh mi je zatitrao na usnama. Svaku noć bi trebalo pročitati nešto iz djetinjstva da ti uljepša snove. :) :)
Still have it, and still I read it every now and again. It is a story I will cherish forever.
I am in Australia and would like to purchase this edition of the book. Where can I find it?
