The fore story involves a love triangle between three figures, each of them a stock figure brought to life on the page: there's the intrepid female American journalist; the tough American mechanic and the dandy British entrepreneur.
Yet there's quite a lot of humour to offset the carnage, especially the Italian Count and his faithful photographer who bumble their way through the story.
Yes, a lot of the scenarios feel a bit cliched these days, but that doesn't matter: this is a typically tough, no-frills adventure from an author at the top of his game.
I've seen this book a lot over the years.
Well, I decided to give it a try a few weeks ago, and I have absolutely no idea why it's given up so often because I loved it.True I would have enjoyed more action, and the ending left much to be desired with none of the villains of the book ever really reaping the rewards of their misdeeds, but it's a great adventure book with all of that gritty south-African realism that makes Smith's books so enjoyable, even if they do tend to leave a rather nasty aftertaste.
CRY WOLF isn't as entertaining as some of his earlier works - particularly those Courtney novels - purely because of the dark, almost depressing subject matter of the story.CRY WOLF tackles the Italian army's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935.
What eventually happens is something of a foregone conclusion, but the fight the Ethiopians put up is as thrilling as anything else the author's ever written.That's the general back story of this novel, and a lot of the writing is taken up with descriptions of breakneck warfare.
The first part of the book moves quite slowly as the characters and situation are introduced.
Later on the booked moved at closer to the breakneck speed he became famous for.The book deals with the Italian fascist invasion of Ethiopia, a pretty unusual topic.
Smith is well known for careful research so I assume the events and culture are fairly close to reality.
There were Ethiopian characters that could have taken primary roles and I think Smith might have given natives greater roles if he had written this book later in his career.It is an entertaining read about a fairly obscure topic.

This was a great novel, and i really liked it! Something different for me, but i really enjoyed it. The story is breathtaking and the characters so full of life that it's stunning! Maybe i will read one more novel of this author in the future, we'll see.
Heart wrenching when you read of man's inhumanity to others.
Italy wanted Ethiopia and sent a modern army to get it.
Even with an incompetent fool, full of his own importance, the local tribes had little chance of withstanding them.
Two adventurers sold them some arms and armoured cars and were tricked into delivering them.
They did their best but when a supposed ally sold out to the Italians they knew they had no chance.
Filled with high octane action, a little romance and lots of heroics.
Cry Wolf was hugely unsatisfying right up to the last 50 pages.
And then the book drew its lines quickly, stuff started making sense and the heroes were defined.
Gareth Swales is the character that saves the book.
The book actually is not much in terms of narration.
It is redeemed by the larger than life characters and the war background.
It is essentially a war novel with a fair bit of spice thrown in.
Read it quick, in small bursts of energy.
If you sit with it, it tends to go stale.
I really dig Wilbur Smith's books for the most part, but the one thing I cannot stand is that in all of his African novels, he feels the need for pages-long descriptions of animals being shot. I openly admit to feeling nauseated at the mere mention of animal abuse, so to read all about a pride of lions being wiped out was awful.That being said, this still wasn't one of his best. Nothing on The Leopard Hunts in Darkness etc.
This was an average boy's own adventure where suspending belief was required. Having said that it was readable with good strong lead characters but the story dipped when it focused on the antagonists. I started it as a holiday read and had to finish it when I got back. Not as good as earlier Smith novels.
The Italians invade Ethiopia in the pre WWII period. Three westerners caught up in aiding the defenders against the invaders go from one adventure to another with four old armored cars. A fascinating love triangle develops in the midst of the crisis.
Like this author. Good story well written.
Thrilling adventure from a master of the adventure novel.
Another solid read by Wilbur Smith. My main complaints would be that the ending felt rushed and that his descriptions of military equipment are usually way off from the reality.
ExcitingSimply put this in a brilliant book written by one of the world s best a good adventure. Story excellent
Full on actionAction and intrigue by the modern master of suspense rival to Alfred Htchcock they should all be made into films
This was better than later books where he develops fascination with 'breast buds'.
Great writing, as you expect from Wilbur Smith. Good story, plenty of action, humour from The Ras and sexual tension between Vicky, Gareth and Jake.
Non è esattamente il genere di storia che ci si aspetta da Wilbur Smith, nel complesso il libro mi è abbastanza piaciuto anche se ho trovato il finale un pochino deludente.
Fanfiction #3 Un gruppo di avventurieri deve portare armi alle truppe legittimiste contro l'invasione dei baluba (o bingobongo o bulabula).
La parte divertente � quando si scopre che i mau-mau (baluba o bingobongo o bulabula) di turno sono...
In compenso la lettura dei tre libri mostra come abusare della credulit� popolare, di impossibili imprese e amori altrettanto potabili, non sia un ostacolo al successo ma il suo presupposto.
The protagonists are Jake Barton, a former American soldier, now mechanic who loves machines and dreams of inventing his own engine; Vicky Camberwell, a journalist for the Associated Press; and Gareth Swales, a former English soldier who fancies himself a dandy but is truly a user of people.
It was very informative about a conflict I never even knew existed.
There is obviously a love triangle between the protagonists.
The historical information was very enlightening and caused me to really feel for the African peoples and their struggles, which seem to be never ending.
I skim read this towards the end as I didn't really want to read about the warfare.
The subject of this book is the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936.
The main characters are a wheeler dealer Gareth who is very British and the American Jake who are both trying to raise money by selling old weapons and armoured cars to the Ethiopians.
Add in a woman they both desire and it makes for some interesting interactions.
They are tricked by the Ethiopians into delivering the vehicles and then end up getting involved.
There are some brutal events which I wasn't really in the mood to read.
I thought II WW commenced in 1939 with Hitler invading Austria. In this book I find Mussolini had already attacked Ethiopia in 1935. I can't say how historically accurate this is!The story is about an American engineer, an English major who is also a buccaneer and an American lady journalist. They get caught up in the war and are obliged to fight for the Ethiopian tribe which is under attack. The story is compelling.It is not just the atrocities by the Mussolini's Army but the customs of the local tribesmen whose practices are nothing short of savagery. Well written.
Smith's talent for detailed description is as vivid as always. He never shies away from realism and violence. Jake and Gareth are the two heroes in this story set in Ethiopia during the Italian invasion. A feisty, sexy reporter who is determined to inform the world of the desperate situation in which the Ethiopians find themselves joins up with Jake and Gareth in their attempt to aid the Ethiopians against the onslaught of the Italians. There is no lack of action in this harsh, but often compassionate story. So, 3 or 4 stars? I can't decide.
Does what it is meant to.Good romp, which does have its serious side (war is bad, especially when it's a goal mishap)Stereotypes all their in force - loveable rogue (not as posh as he seems), salt of earth artisan, feisty woman, comic side kick, comic cowardly Italian ( runs away, sings, vain), salt of earth professional soldier, loveable crazy native, evil native, etc.But its fine and what you want when it is properly executed, as it is here
The premise of the book is historical Ethiopia just prior to WW2 when Italy invaded. As an adventure book, with two displaced Americans and an Englishman in a love triangle, assisting a local clan against the invasion, the story line was a little drawn out with too many unnecessary details for my taste. I had to start skimming in order to complete it because I hate to cheat and jump to the end prematurely.
I thoroughly enjoy Wilbur Smith's stories and writing. His characters, style, and humor make picking up his books something to look forward to after a hard day. Cry Wolf is a fascinating glimpse into pre-WWII Africa. His characters come alive as their lives come together in the crucible of war. Cry Wolf is just plain outstanding.
Ένα περιπετειώδες βιβλίο που συνδυάζει έρωτα, δράση, ιστορία, μυστήριο και πολύ χιούμορ σε μια άψογα δομημένη μυθιστορηματική πολεμική ιστορία. Οι χαρακτήρες είναι τόσο ζωντανοί που μοιάζουν σαν να είναι εκεί δίπλα σου και να σου μιλούν οι ίδιοι. Οι ανατροπές κρατούν αμείωτο το ενδιαφέρον μέχρι το τέλος.
Loved this book! Next to The Burning Shore and the Courtney Books this was one of my all time favorites! The characters were really interesting and I loved Gareth, the rogue. The relationship between he and Jake was heartfelt despite their love for the same woman. I would highly recommend this book -it's got everything from adventure, romance, humour and all this during war time.
