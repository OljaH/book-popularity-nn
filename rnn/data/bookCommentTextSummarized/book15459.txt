At last a book in this series with a conclusion!!! I have to say this installment was 200+ pages of really great reading. I blew through it in no time at all. I really like Darren, his character is well written and I find myself very much relating to him. To be honest, I find myself reading the series primarily to see where things are going to go with this main character. This time the author did not disappoint.  I think I would have rather read one book with 600 pages than this and the last tw
To be honest, I find myself reading the series primarily to see where things are going to go with this main character.
I think I would have rather read one book with 600 pages than this and the last two 200 page books in this series with cliffhangers but I don't control that.
I think the 600 page book would have been a easy 5 star read.
So far, I think it's a great series for tweens and young teens.
To read my review of the other books in this series, use the links below:
All cool and exciting but... that ending was a little bit crazy and senseless. But he has to be "the one", right?
The action was a little boring for me, but I liked seeing how Darren had an epiphany during it.
That part of him made me see that he had really grown up and was no longer a kid, even though his outer appearance would be like one.The ending was really cool.
I dunno, it just made me laugh..Overall, it was a good book and the end threw me a little because I thought I had remembered that event as happening later in the series!
But, overall, the ending was good.Gosh, I wish true love prevailed in this book, where the lovers would have a HEA...
This book has been so Heart wrenching!!! But I absolutely loved the ending!
دارن در چهارمین آزمون شکست میخورد. او نگران مجازاتی است که برایش در نظر خواهن گرفت، دارن متوجه میشود یکی از دوستانش به قبیله اشباح خیانت کرده، اگر خائن رسوا نشود، قبیله از بین میرود و اگر دیگران را خبر کند خود باید در انتظار مجازات مرگ باشد. ا. شربیانی
In the last book Darren fell into a river when he was betrayed by his friend Kurda Smahlt who was in league with the vampeneze "the vampires arch enemy" and kurda was planning an attack on the vampires .
When he regained strength he made the trek back to vampire mountain where Kurda Smahlt was about to become a prince but Darren stopped the ceremony and told everyone what happened.
The vamires won the battle but lost a vampire general, Arra Sails, but Darren who failed the trails of inatation in the last book still had to be sentenced to death.
This book is in a series about a young boy who is blooded by a Vampire.
Kurda was going to betray the clan, he plotted with his their ex- blood cousins the Vampanze.
Darren came back to Vampire Mountain to stop Kurda and the Vampanze.Darren stopped there plans with the help of Seba Nile.
After the brutal and bloody battle with the blood cousins, Darren was made a Vampire Prince so he would not have to face his death penalty.
It was then he took his rightful place among his blood brothers and his fellow Princes
کل کتاب خوب بود. ولی ده صفحهٔ آخر چی میگفت دقیقاً؟ :|احساس میکنم اسکل شدم :|

Each of the last three installments feels like it was churned out without a single thought other than to make money.
The first three of the series started out promising and were entertaining, but when the story turned away from the Cirque Du Freak and focused on the society of the vampires, it just all went downhill from there.
No one wants to read about how vampires are honorable, trustworthy, and reliable.
I thought Mr. Crepsley was creepy in the first three books, but now his character has been reduced to a caring, soft-hearted foster parent for Darren.
If you decide to you want to read this, stick to the first three stop, srsly!
While the decisions of the council irritated me in the fifth book, and Darren’s adherence to the ridiculous trials, the plot is picking up from that cliffhanger to go in directions I like again.Graphic and depressingly grim with some of the fight scenes, I'm glad Darren redeemed himself more in my eyes with his thoughts towards some actions that had to happen.
Darren is such a likeable character that I'm glad the vampires in this book held more common sense than before.Shan is leaving the black-and-white behind, redeeming the characters a little as their world opens and the opinions start to stretch out, seeking that there may be valid points even in the actions of traitors.
Now he must return to Vampire Mountain again, where he has a sentence to be driven upon a pit of stakes, but he must face them anyway so that he can reveal to them that there is a traitor in their midst who is about to let a good chunk of vampaneze take over.Review:Wow!
Plus, Darren still needs to get into Vampire Mountain and tell the Princes what is going on before he is killed.
It was believable to me that Darren felt guilty about killing a vampaneze and not just because he is the acclaimed good guy.
He survived a very hard road, he was swept away by a water current and he had to swim to shore.
Darren survived and lived off the food the wolves provided including their milk which was gross for Darren but desperate times called for desperate measures.
I would rate this book 5 stars because I feel as though this is the turning point of the whole saga, Darren's life is on the line if he makes it to Vampire Mountain and if he does not survive with the wolves, he will also perish.
even as a half vampire, i thought you would be burned to a crisp in the hall of flames but you proved me wrong.
I think that the pointy hall thing was the easy one of the four trials you attempted.
I think it was a strange choice but you did save the vampires from a attack on the vampaneze.Kurda's relationship with you was strange.
i do think he deserved to be put to the stakes.Your life is a wild story and so many strange things happened to you.
Then he came up with the grand plan to attack those vampaneze in hiding, and also took someone's lives for the first time.
And a major twist of fate happened to the vampire assistant at the end of this book.I know Darren Shan is the main character; the center of attention of this book, but it puzzles me that the vampires in this book –even the Vampire Princes– are so 'weak'.
They weren't the ones who came up with the idea of how to attack the vampaneze.
It looks like everything's left for Darren to figure out.
Following on from where the last book ends, this one sees Darren on a mission to inform the vampires of current events.As with every book in the series it is well written and perfectly paced, keeping you interested from start to end. I also recommend you be ready for some unexpected events (although if I say anymore, even if I was to direct you as to which emotions you’ll need to keep an eye on, I would be saying too much and giving things away).
It wasn't as action-packed as the previous book but still there were some very good parts. The end surprised me but in a good way! There happened a lot and even though Darren fucked up a little bit I think he's my favourite character now. I really hope we'll see more of the wolves but I fear that they won't be seen in the next few books
Really really enjoyed this book! So much so I finished it in one sitting. Most of the characters in the book seem to have mixed feelings about Kurdas “betrayal” and personally I found myself feeling sorry for him as well. Perfect example of trying to do the right things but getting it tragically wrong in the process.
At the very least the reader learns a bit more about the oncoming threat of the vampaneze.WritingSince not much action happened in The Vampire Prince the writing was quite dull.
You could have easily switched Vanez and Arra and it would have been better because at least the one female vampire that Shan actually gave a name to wouldn’t have succumbed to the fate that she did.The only other things I didn’t like was about how Kurda went about things and how the reader’s supposed to regard the vampaneze.
I've waited a very long time to read this book and now I have read it just as great as they have a b
A vampire afraid of bats? They don't go around drinking blood or anything? Nah
Kurda 💔
Nemám slov, hned musím jít na další díl!
Just when I thunk this series can't get any better, it does just that! And Ralph Lister does an amazing job bringing the story to life! So great!
به نظر من کتاب سرزمین اشباح بهترین کتابی است که تا حالا خواندم .در این کتاب نویسنده آن قدر به جزئیات اشاره کرده که داستان خیلی واقعی دیده می شود
Aku mulai lelah dengan Gunung Vampir, tapi aku tebak tidak lama lagi akan terbebas dari sana.
Sekali lagi aku merasa hukum vampir sangat konyol.
Akhir cerita membuatku ingin melempar buku, tapi kalau dipikir-pikir, itulah akhir terbaik yang bisa ditulis.
Inilah saat kita berpisah dengan para vampir; Seba Nile, Kurda Smahlt, Paris Skyle, Mika Ver Leth, Arrow, Vanez Blane, Arra Sails dan lain-lain.----------------------------------------Waspadalah terhadap orang yang kaupercayai.
- Halaman 7Sangatlah mudah untuk menutup mata terhadap pengkhianat dan mengenyahkan mereka dari benak kita.
Tapi itu berarti tidak memedulikan akar masalah kita dan membuka celah untuk pengkhianatan lainnya.
I had a sudden thought: "I bet it's Steve." About halfway through the book, I had gotten distracted for a few seconds, thinking about how I should probably expect Steve to make a reappearance; and then, as Paris was saying something during Kurda's trial, that's when I got that crazy idea.
Hard to explain.)Anyway, I found the writing slightly painful to read in one or two places, such as after character!Darren killed the first vampaneze and was saying, "I hated myself for what I'd done"; I dunno, it just sounded a little unnecessary.
After all the drama was out of the way they went back to interrogate Curta who told everyone why he became a traitor, then the princes court had to decide what to do with Darren after all he did abandon the mountain before receiving his punishment for failing the initiation challenge.Darren seemed a lot strong in mind and spirit in this one and I liked that, he was more independent and showed real growth from the last book, really showing his age then.
conflicts:kurda is a trator and is working for the vampaneze; therefore, darren must stop kurda from becoming a vampire prince.
Climax: darren finally gets recovered and tries to get back to vampire mountain with help of some wolves.
the trainer believes darren of kurda and helps hi anouce the new to every mountain in the mountain.
when dareen does come out to announce the news two of kurdas men try to kill darren before he spoke.
Darren was so beat up after rolling out of the river cave and he felt like he had to tell the vampires at vampire mountain what was going on.
Darren Shan and Alexander Gordon Smith are two of my favorite authors, but after reading the sixth book, Darren Shan is leading in the poles on who's the better author.
The book starts out with Darren being nursed back to full health by the pack of wolves that followed him and Mr. Crepsley and a fellow General of Larten's to the mountain just days before.
The main characters of the book are Darren, Mr. Crepsley, Harkat, Princes Ares, and Prince Arrow.
The last book left us with Darren going down the burial stream that runs under the Mountain.
The book carries on from when Darren Shan was falling down a huge waterfall in Trials of Death, and he must make his way back to Vampire Mountain, while avoiding Kurda Smahlt and his accomplices.
These wolves help him make his way back to Vampire Mountain safely.
Kurda's treason includes hiding vampaneze inside the mountain, preparing to murder the princes and attempting to gain control of the Stone of Blood (a powerful stone that can be used to locate any vampire who has touched it) with which he would force the vampires to join the vampaneze and become a single clan once more.
