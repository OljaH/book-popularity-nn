Not light reading, but not at all dense, heavy literature.The Grass is Singing would make a great film but would be very difficult to do in this day and age of pc language, publicly reviling the awful Mugabe and talking of how it wasn't good for the blacks before Mugabe is one thing.
And it isn't the inhumanity they suffered under Sir Cecil Rhodes.This is a good companion book to Nadime Gordima's July's People, which at a similar domestic, personal level deals with racism in South Africa.
Doris Lessing's first novel has the precision of a fine short story and the depth of a much longer novel. This portrait of the psychological disintegration of a farmer's wife saddled with an ineffectual husband on a luckless South African farm is precisely realized and and completely convincing. The last quarter of the novel, however, is weaker than the rest. The character of the black house servant Moses is more of a symbol than a human being, and the ending--meant to be tragic--descends to melodrama.
The voice of the omniscient narrator glows with the clarity of objective facts that is missing in the rest of the novel, replaced by an increasingly suffocating account of two doomed lives that slowly disintegrate in polarized madness.The tragic end of Mary Turner, a white woman, in the hands of Moses, her black servant, in a remote, hostile South African hell is reported in crushing detachment by a young farmer, recently arrived from Great Britain, who cannot digest the unwritten laws of the Apartheid.
In her first novel, The Grass is Singing (first published 1950), Doris Lessing begins with a short description of a crime on a farm in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe):MURDER MYSTERYBy Special CorrespondentMary Turner, wife of Richard Turner, a farmer at Ngesi, was found murdered on the front veranda of their homestead yesterday morning.
It’s all the more powerful because of Lessing’s intimate focus on the psychological toll taken on the three main characters: Mary Turner, Dick Turner, and Moses, their African houseboy (a title that is difficult to type, but that says much about the racial hierarchy in Southern Rhodesia at the time).
Mary Turner is a hideous woman; bitter, cruel, entitled.
Sometimes people are broken so early in their life that it’s impossible to ever be whole, and at her core, Mary Turner was ruined long before adulthood and her neurosis was merely the lid on a simmering pot of rage and hurt.
The book opens with her murder; we know she’s doomed.
This is Lessing’s portrayal of a woman without a choice; a child without a choice; a people without a choice.
The farm fails, the marriage fails, Mary Turner’s brain fails.
The atmosphere in this book is sweltering, suspenseful, and hypnotic.
But they are not filled out in anything like as much depth as the white characters.Dick Turner, one of the more sympathetic white main characters, feels aggrieved, thinking of of the South African government as being "under the influence of n------lovers from England." And the newcomer Tony Marston, "had the conventionally "progressive" ideas about the colour bar, the superficial progressiveness of the idealist that seldom survives a conflict with self-interest." The author repeatedly castigates her white characters by implication, for lumping all "natives" together.

Colonialism in southern Africa: both sides left in destruction Doris Lessing, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for literature, tells the incredibly haunting story of the disintegration and descent into madness of Mary and her husband Dick Turner, simultaneously revealing the scathing truths of apartheid-ruled life in Rhodesia. This was her first book, published in 1950. What a debut! I'm stunned, I have goosebumps; I'm unfit to do this book justice, to convey the claustrophobic, solitary descent
Doris Lessing, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize for literature, tells the incredibly haunting story of the disintegration and descent into madness of Mary and her husband Dick Turner, simultaneously revealing the scathing truths of apartheid-ruled life in Rhodesia.
Lessing sets the tone for this novel in the first page, illuminating the colonial attitude towards the black Africans.** It is made painfully clear as the novel progresses, especially through Mary's treatment of the workers in her home and on the farm, which originates from both fear and the poisoned world she has lived all her life.This is a story of poverty, of racism, of the twin solitude that marriage can be.
But then native commissioners tend to think in terms of the past"Here we have the assumption of white authority and expertise, exotification of 'native tradition', followed by a confession of ignorance that must be diffused with assertions of indifference and contempt.Having opened with the aftermath of the murder, Lessing rewinds to unravel the tableau, telling the story of Mary from her childhood.
Due to his lack of business sense and short attention span with his misguided investments, he never makes money, and both he and Mary are harrowed and embittered by their poverty.Like all of the white South Africans, Dick is an ardent bigot, and Lessing-as-author cannot restrain herself from direct criticism of him: "'Listen to me,' said Dick curtly.
2.5 Stars The Grass is singing by Dorris Lessing was a bookclub read.I found the book an ok read, I liked the setting of the novel and thought the author conveyed an excellent sense of time and place.
It is thought he was in search of Valuables., While I felt the Novel was extremely well written in places I never really felt the author gave me the full facts of the stroy and therefore I never believed what I was reading.
Scott FitzgeraldDoris Lessing's, the Nobel Prize  winning debut book, The Grass is Singing revolves around a youngish woman who after marrying a South African white farmer, and within a few years, looses herself and becomes a victim to immense loneliness as she realizes her husband's constant failure both in his farm as well as in their shared marital life, and that's how her remorse grabs her soul and makes her extremely critical towards her black servants treating them with distaste and hatred, ultimately paying a heavy price for her racial discrimination towards her servants.
I had a feeling this was going to be a challenging book for me.The opening chapter is very difficult to read, begins with a newspaper report about the murder of a white woman by a black man, a servant in her house.The ' shocking' racism, the language which even in my living memory was thought tolerable, normal had me cringing.The story continues told in a third person , almost omniscient voice which allowed me to see most of the characters, the white people at least from each point of view, but very little of the black people's perspective is openly told, rather it's intimated at so you have to 'feel out' what they are thinking.Doris Lessing has a way of describing places and things, sounds, smells that made me feel like I was there, in that time and place.I'm really glad I read this book which was suggested to me by Raul for the August book swap suggestions on All about books.
But she did not know that loneliness can be an unnoticed cramping of the spirit for lack of companionship.'.::Songs of the awaited ending::.'It is difficult to tell with women how they are.'When the new houseboy, Moses, who once felt the whip of sjambok by his 'madame' in a heated situation, and always acts as 'an object of abstraction and a machine without a soul' starts showing his kindness during her hard-times, Mary bleakly remembers his existence in this world as human-being, though of different color and culture.
I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this book (because how can you enjoy the telling of the slow but constant decomposition of a woman and her psyche) but I do have to say that it was an engrossing read.
Although I could not identify with the characters and rejected their weaknesses and frailties, I could not put the book down.
The author creates a wonderful psychological vortex in the hot and arid lands of the African bush and she is not afraid to take it to its ultimate conclusion.
The book is also a parable for racism, colonialism, and white supremacy in Africa and the destructive they had.
هذهِ الرواية مكتوبة بحنكة طبيب سايكولوجي عريق درجة الفهم للنفس البشرية والمرأة بالذات، وكم الحكمة في هذهِ الرواية صادم بالفعل. بدت لي الرواية أول الأمر مملة، لكن هذا التعمق في شخصية "ماري" تعمق غريب لم أصادف من قبل كاتباً يرى دواخل الإنسان بهذا الوضوح، كاتباً يكتب بهذهِ القوة والسيطرة الآن فهمت سر عظمة دوريس ليسنج!
Farm and an unhappy marriage drives Mary further and further into herself until she is hardly recognizable.Lessing has a fairly severe commentary on this time period (40's or 50's I think?) and makes clear judgments on everything from the reasons for marriage to the proper way to farm, but most significantly she critiques the treatment of the native African people by the whites.
Even the staunchest bigot would feel a little uneasy reading her commentary on the poor treatment of the farm hands, and the white's assumptions about them.I'd definitely recommend this book for those who can handle being in a bit of a funk for 200 pages.

I wasn’t quite sure if I believed what I was being told, so rather than accepting the givens, I questioned everything, and ultimately I became annoyed.The book is about life on the veld in what is today Zimbabwe.
She cannot deal with sexual attraction; it throws her completely off kilter!This book is about how white colonials look at native Africans.
The environment, the weather, the shabbiness, the heat, the storms weigh on you as you read this book and impose a sense of doom and hopelessness.
I personally think Doris Lessing’s book concerns more the thoughts of a woman with emotional problems, but the atmosphere of the time and place is impressive.
Their books, however, were based on historical events, where as Lessing's book was relevant to the era it was written in and with a powerful message about human relations which would eventually lead to a revolution in Africa beginning in the 1960's.
The story of Mary Turner could have been any women's who ended up on farms anywhere in the world, especially for those women who had to settle on new continents in basically harsh, uncompromising wilderness.
The cultural barrier that existed and lead to the dramatic events in the end could not have been done better.Listen to this Podcast with the author about this book.

MISTERIOSO DELITTO.(dal nostro corrispondente).Mary Turner, moglie di Richard Turner, agricoltore di Ngelsi, è stata rinvenuta assassinata ieri mattina, sulla veranda della propria abitazione.
Mary Turner, moglie di Richard Turner è stata assassinata da un giovane nero.
Una società che si fa forza e nasconde le sue paure più profonde in una coalizione artificiale.Questa è la tragica storia di Mary e Richard: due personaggi che non sanno stare al gioco: perdenti in partenza e le loro vite non possono che contenere le note di un dramma.
This was a mystery, at least it started out that way with a murder/mystery.
As the story unfolded it revealed how and why the murder of a white woman in South Africa had taken place.
However the murder was just one aspect of the novel overall.
Some cringe worthy moments reading this due to some of the language used but it fitted the times.....This was a story of loneliness, loss of self, apathy and disintegration, of a marriage gone badly.I've not read Lessing before and found this listed on the Boxall 1000 list.
The story came in at around 50% on kindle but felt much longer.
My brother-in-law loves to spend his weekend drinking with his buddies.
And especially if you are intelligent.This was Lessing's very first novel, published thirteen years before her most famous work, "The Golden Notebook," yet she had written it like a true master.
Lessing is telling the story of this housewife, living in an open country in South Africa, with her decent but inept husband, their crumbling house with no attic, their poverty, and a black slave named Moses, so you read and listen.
Then you close the book, sighing contentedly, like your mother after she had finished watching her favorite tv soap.
VideoRecensione: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMbNa... ne parlo al minuto (6:00)
"The Grass Is Singing" was Doris Lessing's first novel, published in 1950 when she was thirty years old, had moved from Southern Rhodesia to London and had had 3 children by two husbands.
While “The Grass Is Singing” reflects Lessing's deep feeling of place, it is the least autobiographical of her Africa novels.
But “The Grass Is Singing” is a masterful work that unflinchingly exposes the brutality of the relationship between white masters and black workers and the fear and repression at its core.
The novel begins with the murder of Mary Turner, a farmer's wife, and the arrest of Moses, her houseboy.
When I first started out on this book I was convinced that the story would focus on Apartheid in South Africa.
To my surprise the core of the book is about something completely different (from my perspective) in terms of life paths, dreams and expectations versus the brute force of reality.
The true main character is the landscape, the unrelenting flow of time and seasons in the African grasslands under which both human structures and minds crumble.
The part I am particularly drawn to is when Lessing muses about the South African landscape, the colors of the sky and light, as she embraces the reader with the sounds of insects and scents of dust and flowers.
I liked this book a lot, even more so realising it was Lessing's first novel written back in 1950.
I flew through this short book in little over a day, as I was captivated by the story and wanted to find out what happened.
Yet somewhere towards the end, the story ran out of steam for me and kind of drifted off from all the detail that I'd previously loved.
While this book won't become a favourite, it has certainly inspired me to read more from Doris Lessing and to expand on the little I know about her life.
I have no doubt that this is a brilliant book but it is not for me.
Wow, mikä kirja! Ehdottomasti yksi kesäni intensiivisimpiä kirjoja tunnelmaltaan. Upea esikoisromaani tulevalta Nobel-voittajalta.
Böyle bir zorunluluk sonucunda da tabiri caiz ise karşısına çıkan, kendisine ilgi gösteren ilk erkekle evleniyor.
Evlendiği adam Dick ise Mary ile farklı bir hayat tarzına sahip.
Aynı zamanda ilk defa "zenci"lerle bu kadar yakın bir ilişki içine girmek zorunda kalıyor.
Onlardan ölümüne nefret ediyor; ama nefretinin bir temeli yok aslında.
En son çalışanlarından ise hem geçmişte yaşadıkları bir olay yüzünden hem de giderek ona karşı cinsel çekicilik hissetmesi sebebiyle nefret ediyor.
Aslında Mary'nin nefret etmek için açık bir sebebi yok.
Sırf toplumda kendisine empoze edilen bu olduğu için onlardan nefret ediyor.
Ayrıca akıcılığı ile çok keyifli bir okuma sunuyor okuyucuya.
