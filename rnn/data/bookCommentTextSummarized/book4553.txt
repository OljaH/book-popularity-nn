I also started to expand upon my collection of Enid Blyton titles at every possible flea market and second-hand bookshop occasion, and there were a lot of these during my childhood as I'm now the proud owner of several hundreds of her books; all the old versions, with some titles in different languages too, and all still stored at my parents' place in the Netherlands - sorry mum!Despite my obsession with the St Clare's books in particular, and Enid Blyton in general as I read every possible book on her I could find (this was before the Internet existed) - and was mighty impressed by not only the wealth of books she wrote but also all her other ventures including producing a club magazine, writing short stories and doing a lot of good for children - I haven't actually read any of her books in about 15 years.
The O'Sullivan Twins (St. Clare's, #2), Enid Blytonعنوان: دوقلوهای اوسالیوان جلد 2؛ نویسنده: انید بلایتون؛ مترجم: ایلونا جودمردی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، شهر کتاب، هرمس (کیمیا)، 1386، در 202 ص، اندازه 19 در 5/11 س.م.، شابک: 9789643630669؛ جلد 2 از مجموعه سنت کلر
And, yet, once we move past that question of position, of context, then we have to consider the book itself and even that proves somewhat complicated.
There are new girls; one that's a family relation of the O'Sullivan twins and almost too near to the 'girls we've just met' to be considered as a 'girl we're yet to know'; a Girl With A Past, a girl who is lovely, and there is an elaborate midnight feast involving the best possible moment involving sausages I have perhaps to read in this genre.
** Books 274 - 2017 **3,4 dari 5 bintang! Baru selese baca buku pertamanya lalu saya ketagihan untuk membaca buku keduanya untuk mengikuti kisah kekonyolan gadis-gadis kelas satu dan dua di St. Clare padahal timbunan buku saya dirumah sudah akut menumpuk Terimakasih Scoop Premium!
I bought the whole series at the annual school book sale and read them all in 2 months!
This was my obsession before Harry Potter lolActually, there are only 3 book series that I absolutely love:1.
My first book obsession was with a children's book (in Greek) that my grandma used to read me in bed before I even went to school.
Wolf, T., Ο παραμυθένιος κόσμος του δάσους : Η παράξενη χώρα.- Αθήνα : Στρατίκη, [1983;:], 59 σ.: έγχρ.
I actually really enjoyed this one, which is surprising seeing that I thought the third installment was pretty dreadful.
I enjoyed all the minutiae of school life and the lush descriptions of food and of lovely things.
It's a very manichean world but Blyton does have some characters who do unexpected things which I suppose redeems her somewhat.
There's also a very lovely girl in the book who gets the amount of praise she deserves - praise isn't very abundant in Blyton's world so this was a nice surprise.
There is an undeniable charm about this collection. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I love reading it even if the books don't really have a plot and are more a collection of short stories that are all connected by a thread of "the twins in the school", and even some don't include the twins.I don't know what kind of magic this series has, but it's totally worth a re-read and I'm devouring these books again.
This book is hilarious, but only after you realize that it *doesn't* even have a legitimate plot.
loved it
Just as lovely at age 22 as it was at age 12 ❤️
This was such a fun read to revisit. If you're a fan of Mallory Towers, then I definitely recommend reading St. Clare's.
This was a 3 star up until the end! So suspenseful!
I say, what fun!
I also enjoyed the fact that all of the characters grew as people and showed signs of having a consciousness, two examples of this were Erica and the first year girls.
Commencing with Erica, she did selfish, horrendous things, but as Daisy saved her life she felt extremely bad of her acts and she told Lucy what she did.
Buku ini mengajarkan remaja perempuan untuk mengejar impian mereka dengan kerja keras dan disiplin.
Setiap tokoh menunjukkan perkembangan yang sangat baik di akhir cerita.(Copy-paste dari blog pribadi, www.diaryofbrunette.wordpress.com)Selain alur cerita yang ringan serta konflik yang berkaitan dengan remaja (tidak ada tambahan drama yang kurang penting), Enid Blyton juga sangat piawai dalam menyelesaikan konflik setiap karakternya.
Melalui karakter-karakternya, buku ini mengajarkan kita bahwa wanita bisa menjadi yang terbaik dengan kerja keras dan disiplin tinggi.
Minimnya bumbu romansa dalam buku ini pun menjadi pesan bahwa tujuan hidup bukan hanya mengenai pasangan hidup, tapi juga cita-cita meraih pendidikan dan karir yang terbaik.
Tadinya aku mau kasih 3🌟 untuk buku ini, karena ceritanya rata-rata sama dengan seri Malory Towers.
Tapi akhirnya kukasih 4🌟 karena secara nggak sadar, aku juga meresapi makna-makna yang terkandung dalam buku ini.Iya aku tahu dalam tiap buku Enid pasti ada hal positif yang bisa diambil.
Enid selalu berhasil menyelipkan makna-makna baik dalam tiap bukunya, tapi ceritanya yang berputar di sana membuat aku cukup bosan.
Hal pertama, tokoh utamanya selalu nggak suka sama sekolahnya dan bersikap membangkang di buku pertama.
Kalau kamu perlu easy read yang bermanfaat, kamu perlu coba baca seri-seri sekolah Enid Blyton (Malory Towers, St.Clare dan seri Si Badung) karena selain jadi bacaan ringan, buku-buku ini juga akan mengisi kamu dengan makna-makna baiknya.
Setelah menyelesaikan buku kedua ini.
Saya ingin membisikkanmu beberapa hal yang menarik tentang asrama putri St.Clare ini.💕 Di asrama ini, jika ada pakaian, sprei, sarung bantal yang robek, setiap siswi diharuskan menambal/menjahitnya sendiri.💕 St.Clare menerima murid dari berbagai kalangan.
Bukan hanya anak-anak dari keluarga kaya raya.
Meski faktanya, banyak dari mereka yang memang berasal dari keluarga berada dan kaya raya.💕 Ada kebiasaan yang unik di sekolah ini.
Dimana anak-anak dari kelas yang rendah diwajibkan melayani anak-anak dari kelas yang lebih tinggi.
Seperti merajang air, menyalakan tungku sampai membersihkan sepatu.Membaca buku Kembali Ke St. Clare mengenalkan saya pada pengalaman Alison bersekolah di sini.
This book series is very sweet and has lovely little moral values spun within each adventure of the twins. Character development is the main focus of each story as the twins meet new classmates and teachers upon each return to their school. Life experiences teach valuable lessons.My favorite character is Carlotta, the little circus girl who loves who she is through and through and remains unique throughout every school year.
I am sure some people would be offended by some of the old-fashioned attitudes in the book, particularly about marriage and women, but I think it is still a good read if you can avoid judging it by current standards. I will say however that boarding school girls seemed very quick to leap to conclusions without much evidence in the Blyton era!
Not my favourite Blyton school story. Though the side characters - lovely Lucy who is not just charming but really good, sulky but brave Margery - are interesting, and featherheaded but fundamentally decent Alison and the truly weak Erica are good contrasts, there is just too much bad temper and outright bullying by ‘good’ girls of those they don’t like.
A couple of bits made me feel rather irritated towards the characters, and boy did I feel bad for Alison and Margery. Overall, however, I enjoyed this. The writer has a way of making the characters come to life, and thereby earning strong responses from the reader.
I loved it! From the time they where stuck-up first formers to when their head girls! I loved the St Clares Stories! My favorite charter is Pat Isabel Janet Hilary Allison Claudine and Lady Phyllis Bentley!
verry fascinating book and I am proud to be the owner of this book. Couldn't get my head out of it. when I had any spare time I would begin to read. Was so so funny even forgot about drawing it was a real page turner.
Selain Alison yang angkuh (dan cantik), ada juga Lucy yang pintar dan Margery yang masih tinggal di kelas 1 meskipun usianya sudah pantas menduduki kelas yang lebih tinggi.
Bisakah murid-murid baru ini beradaptasi di St.Clare?Menurut saya, banyak hal baik yang bisa diambil dari buku buku Enid Blyton (melalui idenya tentang sekolah asrama).
Buat saya sih oke oke saja, tapi mungkin untuk anak SD *which is for whom the book was written* bisa jadi agak susah dipahami.Secara keseluruhan, buku kedua ini masih mempunyai pola yang sama dengan buku-buku enid blyton lain tentang sekolah asrama.
Allison, sepupunya si Kembar, yang cantik tapi konyol, Margery Fenworthy yang kasar dan pemarah, dan Lucy Oriell yang pintar, ramah dan selalu riang gembira.Ada pesta tengah malam untuk merayakan ulang tahun Tessie yang duduk di kelas dua, namun pesta tersebut ketauan gara-gara Erica-yang culas, tapi Erica tidak mau mengaku dan meminta maaf terhadap teman-temannya sehingga anak-anak bersepakat menghukumnya.
Karena sifat Margery yang buruk, awalnya, anak-anak memberikan kesempatan kepada Margery untuk berubah dengan bersikap ramah terhadapnya, tapi Margery bersikap kasar pada Bu Lewis sehingga membuat anak-anak kembali menjauhi Margery, bahkan memboikot Margery saat pertandingan lacrosse dan membongkar rahasia Margery.
The second in the series, though the first I ever read all those years ago.
Already displaying bookwormish tendencies, I thought this was the coolest thing ever (though probably did not describe it thus, "cool" not really having entered Glaswegian vernacular by c.1985).The chapter about Margery, Erica and the fire in the sanatorium (sanitarium?
It probably also explains why, when I met my first ever real-life Erica, in my class at uni, I took an inexplicable and instant dislike to her (turns out she was a manipulative cow anyway...).
A few years later I met another Erica - a colleague at the pub I worked in - who was quite irritating but sweet.
Seems very soon though of course her characters doesn't get as much story dedicated to her as the twins did last term.
I also found that this term, the stories did focus very much on a few select girls instead of all of them, which, in a way, makes sense.
First term, they were all new characters and we had to get to know them.
This term, there were only a couple of new girls and the book took more time with explaining their stories.Of course the familiar themes of being sensible were explored though not as heavily as before.
Re-reading St Clare's I don't remember reading this one (as a young child) at all but I found that I didn't enjoy this book as much as the previous (The Twins at St. Clares) because they all seemed to turn nasty! It was like bully-fest at St Clare's. It's funny how the 1950s seem really different to nowadays - we seem to take bullying a bit more seriously. Of course, there's no real physical violence (it is a children's story after all) but I did find myself getting angry at some of the charact
Re-reading St Clare's
It was like bully-fest at St Clare's.
It's funny how the 1950s seem really different to nowadays - we seem to take bullying a bit more seriously.
I suppose it just shows the differences between the 1950s and 2010, but I guess I just prefer boarding school stories where the girls ride horses and have midnight feasts, instead of bitch about each other constantly (as I had enough of that in secondary/high school!).I didn't expect children's stories to make me feel so angry, haha.
ga kebayang kepala skolah st.clare punya jadwal btemu dgn sluruh siswa dihari ptama, biar stiap mghadap dua/tiga org skaligus..
brapa lama coba..
kalo satu sesi 5 mnt, satu klas 20-25 org..
satu sekolah brapa lama tuh...
kalo 120 org aja dibagi 2 org persesi udah 60 sesi..
kali 5 mnit, 300 mnt, eh cuma 5 jam yah hehehe...
dikira banyak :pyg gw suka dr st clare adalah pesta tgh malamnya banyak :palison itu mirip2 gwen yah..
cuma kalo gwen culas, alison engga, oonnya sama, tukang meweknya sama, rambut pirangnya sama..pas adegan tessie, pat & d'gank maki2 erica, yg ada gw mlh jd ksian ma erica..
ini ku ambil dari tumpukan buku anak-anak.
Aku mulai berfikir apa dan bagaimana bacaan dapat mempengaruhi pembentukan karakter anak.
eh keasyikan malah.aku suka buku ini.
(sayang nggak punya dari seri satu).Diceritakan, dua kembar, Pat dan Isabel, disekolahkan di St Clare, sekolah berasrama khusus untuk anak perempuan.
Tapi setelah menjalani, mereka akhirnya menyukai sekolah itu.Yang asyik adalah, ini pertama kalinya si kembar pesta tengah malam.
ketahuan juga akhirnya.Yang asyik lainnya adalah keisengan mereka "ngerjain" para guru.
Aduh duh, berasa pengen muda kembali.Tapi sejujurnya banyak pelajaran moral yang diambil dari sini, terutama adalah tentang pentingnya kejujuran dan sikap ksatria.
