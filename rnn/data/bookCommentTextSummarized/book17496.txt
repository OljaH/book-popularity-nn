The only nice thing I can say about this convoluted, ridiculous and BORING hella long novel is that the author, Darcey Bell, is one lucky person.
How she managed to get this stinker of a book sold for movie rights is beyond me.
Maybe the movie will be done right, but if this is the story they are working from...I just don't know.
Wait and see the movie.
I'm convinced they re-wrote this book to death.
I just finished a Liz Nugent novel and the difference between the writing is like comparing a first grader's writing to that of a literature professor's.

After the movie ended, I asked Emily, “Do you think real people would ever do things like that?”Emily laughed. “Sweet Stephanie. You’d be amazed by what people will do. Things they’d never admit to anyone - not even to themselves.” It all begins with a simple favor. You are asked to pick up your best friend's son from school when an emergency at work arises. It all makes sense anyway because your sons are best friends too. It'll be fine because she says she'll need to see her son after such a h
After the movie ended, I asked Emily, “Do you think real people would ever do things like that?”Emily laughed.
You are asked to pick up your best friend's son from school when an emergency at work arises.
She reaches out to her blog readers for help trying to figure out is this normal and should she be worried all the way to asking if anyone has seen Emily.
This allows a bit of introspection, a chance to see who Stephanie is and how she communicates.
At times Stephanie can feel a bit preachy and to be honest quite annoying.
Synopsis:A mommy blogger with an obsession with veggie burgers decides to half-heartedly play Nancy Drew when her best friend goes missing, and chaos ensues.
The author did a hell of a good job showing the difference between Stephanie’s mommy blogging persona and her real personality.
Stephanie is the mommy blogger bestie of Emily who has an aversion to meat and an obsessive love of veggie burgers.
She’s just as gullible, if not more so, than Sean because she literally believes anything anyone tells her.Emily, Whom You’ll Want to Incinerate Over the Fiery Pits of Hell-Emily is the missing bestie of Mommy Blogger, and she’s the worst offender out of the three.
First off, I HATED ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS.
Sure, I'm fine with some likeable characters, but with a story that's as big of high stakes as this, you need to be able to root for someone, but I was honestly rooting for the "villain" of the story because I wanted to scream every time Stephanie had page time.This also wasn't anything special.
And THAT ENDING.....I'm 100% fine with open endings, but it didn't flow well at all and just felt like the author was too lazy to finish the book.
Enough of a knock-off of "Gone Girl" to be annoying, and with enough additional, bizarre elements (incest? Really?) to also be annoying. Pass.

Okay, no one is amaaaaaazed by what people will do anymore.
Especially in a myster/thriller.
Double especially when that mystery/thriller is actually “the next Gone Girl” and when it was released Gillian Flynn was probably all like .
The why behind the woman’s vanishing is not too terribly hard to predict if you’re a frequent reader of books like this, but everything aside from the kitchen sink is thrown in getting there.
(This is when it gets spoiley so step away from the monitor/put yo phone down NOW.) By the 35% mark the “friend” is not only banging her bestie’s hubs but has pretty much moved in with him as well.
Reminded me of Gone Girl, and I hated that book.Okay before I go into this review, I just wanted to say that when I saw the movie trailer for this I honestly wanted to read the book.
I honestly zoned out so many times and was trying to predict the ending 10 minutes into the book.
Each person in this book was so weird, like beyond fucked up kind of weird.
I'm also glad that I didn't get a physical because I probably would've DNF'd the shit out of this.
Mothers, Friends, Secrets....Stephanie and Emily were mothers, they were friends, and they both had secrets even though they thought they knew each other better than they knew themselves.A SIMPLE FAVOR begins when Stephanie keeps Emily's son, Nicky, after school because Emily is going to be late. But...after school turns into overnight, then after school turns into another day and another night, and then yet another day and another night with no Emily.Stephanie didn't know where to turn except t
Sean didn’t even know who Stephanie was.Sean doesn't seem concerned since Emily said she was going on a business trip, but the problem is that Emily never returns from the business trip.Sean, Stephanie, and the two boys spend a lot of time with each other until they find out the truth that Emily is dead.As we read, Stephanie places her thoughts and emotions on her blog ​and also with Sean.A SIMPLE FAVOR keeps having secrets pop up about all of the characters both current and past.A SIMPLE FAVOR had a unique style with Stephanie's blog taking up most of the chapters ​and all the other chapters also being about Stephanie as she lives her daily life with her son and now Sean and Nicky.​ Chapters only about Stephanie change as the book continues, and the scare factor definitely moves up a few notches.
I'm surprised by my 1 star rating, but reflecting upon the plot this morning, I realized that I didn't like the book at all.
It was filled with unlikable characters and the plot was pretty weak if you remove all the fluff surrounding it.
Stephanie and Emily are best friends.
What could of made Emily go missing?
Does Stephanie truly know her best friend?So you have Stephanie, Emily and Emily's husband Sean and boy do they all suck.
I also hated Stephanie's mommy blog that was roughly half of the novel.
Sadly not the novel for me.
Ένα δυνατό ψυχογράφημα. Σκοτεινό και διαστροφικό. Πολλές φορές οι δαίμονες είναι άνθρωποι της διπλανής πόρτας. Σίγουρα σοκάρει.
DNF32%I Feel I'm Reading Trash ???
This whole thing is full of huge spoilers from this point forwardEmily disappears and Super Mom Stephanie melts down.
A wife goes missing and there’s a mysterious insurance policy out there that conveniently stupid Sean “forgot about”.
It’s obvious in the writing even thought the book is nearly half over before it’s “revealed” that Emily has a secret, druggie identical twin.
Emily originally intended to frame her husband (having Stephanie bring along Seans brush) but apparently she went from hating him to deciding to spare him and point the cops in her “friends” direction while she disappeared again, this time with her son.
This is the scenario debut novelist Darcey Bell explores in her pulse pounding psychological suspense novel, A Simple Favour.Touted as a Gone Girl/Girl on the Train offshoot, A Simple Favour stands out on its own.
It is a solid effort for a debut novelist and it does not surprise me that film rights have already been purchased for this slick and compulsive novel.A Simple Favour begins with the blog entries of one of the leading characters in this novel, Stephanie’s life.
As a mum and blogger I could relate.In addition to the blog entries as a form of storytelling, A Simple Favour is also told from the perspective of Stephanie, her best friend Emily, and Sean, Emily’s husband.
This book is messed up and everyone was an idiot. I hope they changed some things to make the movie worth seeing.
A nasty woman disappears after asking her weak-willed "best friend" to take care of her child after school.
A body is later found, the nasty woman is declared and thought by all to be dead, but then the friend starts to have her suspicions.I was so annoyed with Stephanie- the way she talked about moms and to moms like if you are a mother you are a different species.
Her blog was ridiculous.
She was ridiculous.
I hated that she has the same name as me.
Just like GG, I hated the ending.
"Here's to moms and good friends."   A Simple Favor has a whole lot going on and the writing directs your attention in various directions that quite confused me when all was said and done. No, I wasn't confused by the truth but I was confused why I was led astray in Part I.

A Simple Favor has a whole lot going on and the writing directs your attention in various directions that quite confused me when all was said and done.
(view spoiler)[For real, it is painfully set up as if Emily and Stephanie are the components of a multiple personality disorder.
But then readers are redirected from the massive detour and the real psychological thriller begins.
(hide spoiler)] Once the meat of this book picked up speed, it was a fairly interesting ride ...
Note: I am not saying if you liked Gone Girl then you'll like A Simple Favor.
From the outset I should mention that I’m a big Anna Kendrick fan, so when I first saw the trailer for the movie I instantly wanted to see it.I felt that once you know all the surprises in this mystery thriller it would impact the reading experience, so quickly ordered a copy of the book first.The story opens with Stephanie a blogger who is asked by her friend Emily the simple favour of picking her son up from school.Having not heard from her for days Stephanie starts to panic and uses her blog to help find her missing friend.It might be because I know that Stephanie is being played by Kendrick, but I really liked her character.
This is by far one of the worst books I've read. The characters are horrible - either evil and vile or such ridiculous doormats, I want to slam their faces into something. I read the book because I saw the trailer for the movie, and I can say, with conviction, I will never watch the movie. Ever. I don't want to waste any more time elaborating on this steaming pile of horseshit.
This was honestly as terrible as the overall rating and reviews make it out to be. The characters are horrendous, whiny, and annoying. The writing it appalling. The plot is SO Gone Girl that this book should honestly just be called Gone Girl, since very little is different.The only reason I'm giving this an added star is because legit I couldn't stop reading, until I realized I wanted to be reading anything else instead. Still gonna watch the movie though because Blake Lively is bae and also it seems good enough to make me forget about this nonsense book.
I would like to thank Edelweiss, Harper Collins, and Darcy Bell for the advanced digital copy in exchange for an honest review.
Stephanie, a widow with a sordid past, and Emily, a seemingly happily married woman, each have 5 year old sons who happen to be best friends.
The two women appear to be best friends as well.
One day, Emily asks Stephanie for a simple favor.
From that moment on this story flip flops back and forth and in and out every possible psychological thriller scenario.
You can not figure out which end is up, which are the red herrings, or what clues are are vital to this tales dramatic conclusion.
I think I kinda liked it?
I’m still really excited to see Blake play the part of Emily.
Like, didn’t the pretty little liars novels do this 15 years ago?
The characters aren’t particularly likable, which is fine for a novel like this, but it gets tiring to read a book where you’re literally rooting for no one.
Emily setting Stephanie up on a whim, now that was the best twist of the entire novel.
If it weren’t for the movie and my girl Blake, I probably wouldn’t have finished this.
I think this may just be one of the rare stories that’s better in movie form.
I wouldn't recommend this book to a flea, if a flea could read. I hated the blog chapters. They came across as phony and like Stephanie was talking to herself instead of her supposedly loyal followers, and if she had said moms one more time...The other chapters featuring Stephanie were a little better but not much. I thought a lot of the material was tacky and not something I wanted to continue reading.
🤮 (And in the end, a useless plot point which makes for a double 🤮🤮)What I am looking forward to is my book club discussion, it is sure to be a doozy.Stephanie, a widowed stay-at-home mommy blogger, is in need of a friend.
It’s kind of like single white female a little when she meets posh, professional mom, Emily.
The polar opposites become fast friends and then Emily disappears.
I realize that his her character so it did a good job of making me dislike her so.Did you read this book?
No book is for everyone, all opinions welcome (just be kind).
When I watched the trailer of this movie with a redhead Blake Lively, all shrouded in mystery and intrigue, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book!But every time Stephanie went 'Hi moms' on her stupid blog I wanted to kill her.
It was like she wanted to be taken for a ride!!Honestly, I've never seen a dumber character.Emily was the kind of girl our parents warn us to beware of.
Poor guy should have known better than to marry a girl who wanted to watch Peeping Tom on their third date.
Blah writing, flat characters, with a few random gratuitous happenings (I can't even call them twists) tossed in there like sad, soggy raisins in a bowl of watery oatmeal.
Two characters, one a parody of a "mommy blogger"and the other a fashion executive, in some kind of a twisted friend relationship which I didn't even stick around to find out about.
(The book kept pounding home some sort of theme about twins.) After a few chapters I decided that I didn't care.
There is also incest (which has a yuck factor that's hard to get past) and (view spoiler)[ the mommy blogger sleeping with her missing friend's husband.
4,5(view spoiler)[Debo de admitir que el final me decepciono un poquito. Esperaba que Stephanie planeara lo del anillo para incriminar a Emily. Hubiera sido un muy buen giro, que compensaría lo idiota y crédula que se comporto al final. XD (hide spoiler)]

Things they’d never admit to anyone—not even to themselves.”my blogThis book was actually terrible.
I don't even want to watch the movie anymore.
Characters: At first, I liked Stephanie.
She was just so dumb.
Straight dumb.
She just did things that were really weird.
The only thriller I have read and actually enjoyed has been The Girl on the Train.
I just wish I could find a thriller that wasn't predictable, and utterly stupid.
HOW DID THIS EVEN BECOME A MOVIE!?
This is such an amazing book.
We need a movie!
