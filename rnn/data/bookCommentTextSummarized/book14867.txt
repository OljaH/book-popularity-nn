Two hundred and fifty years earlier, Newton had launched one of the most important paradigm changes in history: the physical world should be thought of as mathematical, and explained by mathematical formulas.
But Turing's work is only 80 years old: think of all the physics that was still completely unexplained in 1765.
Despite this, many people believed in Newton's program because of all the things it had explained, which until then had been more or less incomprehensible.
By the early eighties I was pretty well known there.The way one met people was usually by asking the person next to you what s/he was reading.
She was unusually well-read and earnest about much of her studying because she was, she told me, episodically insane.This was all very interesting to talk about.
Instead, she had become unusually serious, thoughtful and, to me, fascinating.Some time after giving me this book, she married, had a baby...then died of a brain aneurism.
While the book includes a number of seminal pieces in philosophy of mind, as well as some great pieces of fiction, they dont' really fit together all that well stylistically or intellectually, and often Dennett and Hofstadter spend a fair amount of time justifying the inclusion of the piece in the book.I will say that both do a fair job writing their own reflections, and discussing the ideas in some of the earlier works, which are used alongside writing by Borges and Nozick and Searle, but those are really the only major brightspots in a work that feels sewn together in odd places, presented in a way that is just south of playful [something Dennett and Hofstadter generally do very well].I think that the major problem for the book is the format.
Both of these guys are famous for developing their ideas in a text and being able to really draw out some interesting detail while presenting very difficult material in an engaging way.
A sampling of its contents:• The brains-in-vats idea that was employed, in slightly different form, in the movie The Matrix.• A fable-like version of the reality-is-a-dream idea, dramatized by Jorge Luis Borges in "The Circular Ruins." (Incidentally, a similar treatment, relying on virtual reality rather than dreams, is used by the movie The Thirteenth Floor).• A tale of simulated consciousnesses, which also manages to question the nature and existence of God, told by Stanislaw Lem in "Non Serviam." Personally, this was the most astounding piece in the book and was, as they say, worth the price of admission all by itself.• John Searle's challenge to the notion that a machine intelligence can ever understand anything, encapsulated in his translator-in-a-box concept.• Thomas Nagel's speculation on the nature of consciousness in "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"• Richard Dawkins's exposition of the idea of memes--surely you've heard of them by now--in an excerpt from his book The Selfish Gene.The entire book seems to be available online, though in a less-than-ideal format.
Well what if ....Thanks for uprooting several dualists still lurking about in me, and letting them shrivel in the glare of the one gold sun.I liked that, while a collection intended to provoke in a variety of ways, the reflections limited the whole.
I especially liked their reflections on Searle (the knobs) and Nagel (what does it mean to make subject object Gödel Carroll my oh my).Though I was disappointed because - in the first Borges essay, "Borges and I", I thought that the reflection was still a continuation of the essay, and a third character, Borges reflecting on himself in the style of a literary critic, had emerged!
A collection of essays and short stories from scientists, philosophers, and fiction authors, all dealing with concepts related to the self and self-consciousness.
Each work is followed by commentary from either Dennett or Hofstadter.
Still, the familiarity of the ideas discussed didn't lessen my enjoyment of the book, especially as the book progressed from standard speculative fiction/philosophical theorizing to much more complicated discussions of consciousness and the self.
The writings alone would be wonderful and thought provoking, but Dennett and Hofstadter's commentaries manage to add yet another dimension to the appreciation of all these works and provoke yet more thought about the ideas discussed.
collection of philosophical think pieces and science fiction stories that touch upon consciousness, the self, identity, Artificial intelligence and animal consciousness. I was delighted when I read this book in the 1990s with the imaginative ideas around the problem of consciousness. Upon reading twenty or so years later I am still struck by how the stories and puzzles presented are still with us. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing but I think it does a good job of expanding imaginative horizons even if the questions it raises are still unsolved.
This book was an excellent introduction to speculative fiction divorced from the modern categories of science fiction and Tolkienesque fantasy. Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadder collected stories that inspired new thoughts and ideas. This book also introduced many to non-American authors with much to offer; for instance, I was introduced to Jorge Luis Borges through this book, and he remains one of my favorite authors.
Hofstadter has collected a set of intriguing essays, short stories, and mini-plays, all designed to help us question our conceptions of "mind." it worked on me the first and second times I read the book. Looking forward to a third.
We all laugh at the thought that a machine may one day develop artificial intelligence, or that human consciousness could reside in a remotely controlled body while its brain is back in the lab, or that one’s mental processes could be stored in a book to be accessed by the manual computation of future readers; but embedded in these simple vignettes are deeply unsettling challenges to the way we view human consciousness and even the concepts of soul and self-worth.
When we pose that question ourselves it is comparitively easy to cast around for answers when we already know ways in which it can be applied.
This book however contains lots of little nuggets in easy to read formats such as Lem's fairytales or the musical references each of which will apply to an individual.
If the right piece is matched to the right person I have never met anyone who could resist begining to read the few pages of analysis that followed.
At that point the person has engaged with the idea and the resistance, not to mention the perception that philosophy is 'boring and for boring old men', is lost.
But maybe if I had read it at some other time of day I wouldn't have such a feeling of my brain being full, that the mental sharpness that I had during my philosophy degree had, like Elvis, left the building.
But maybe it's the book, not me?
Whilst the mix of academic paper and sci-fi short story works (science fiction being, after all, primarily the fiction of ideas), I found too many of the items - Hofstadter's dialogues in particular - flabby and self-satisfied.
I suspect I would have given this more than three stars if I'd gotten around to reading it when I bought it in 1994 as a 24-year old cognitive science postgraduate...
This is the cognitive science.the book contains science thoughts and SF anthology of course Borges's shot storiesand short criticisms.the innovative anthology.  it is SF anthology and thought experiment about brain and consciousness.
This was a big influence on me. Good stuff.
I recommend to anyone who is starting in AI area.
very good - but not as good a GEB :-)
How conciousness is derived from neural activity - questions concerning free will and determinism - Turing machines and Ai
Honestly this changed my way of thinking on several levels.
Si pu�� vedere questo libro in due modi: 1) come una collezione di racconti o divertissement fantascientifici orientati prevalentemente al "mindfuck" del lettore; 2) come un tortuoso trattatello sul problema della relazione tra mente e cervello, volto a tirare acqua al mulino del riduzionismo fisicalista dei due autori, noti per le loro posizioni fortemente anti-dualiste.Considerato dal primo punto di vista, "The mind's I" �� un testo eccellente, che raccoglie scritti brillanti e ricchi di spunti suggestivi.
La "soluzione" al problema mente-cervello che emerge dal testo nel suo complesso �� profondamente lacunosa e solo eufemisticamente definibile come "gioco di specchi".
Nagel's 'What is it to be like a bat' in Nagel's 'Mortal Questions' and Searle's 'Minds, Brains, and Computers' in too many books to count), so the articles that were new to me were of interest for me when diving into this volume.The book has a variety of writings that were originally published in philosophy journals, but others were more in the vain of short stories on the question of AI or consciousness studies, which I quite enjoyed reading and getting a feel for.
I would suggest for the curious reader to go through the book and pick articles to read of interest, but be noted that some articles are in response to one another, so do keep an eye on it.However a good collection.
Do conscious beings really possess free-will, or is it merely an illusion?
Although not a scientific work in any way, "The Mind's I" is designed to constantly amuse the reader with fresh views on the subject.
These comments provide valuable insight into, sometimes confusing, chapters they refer to.My only complaint is that some of the works (e.g "On Having No Head") seemed out of place and not consistent with the rest of the material in the book.
But this minor concern does not diminish the value of the book in any way.
A really thought-provoking collection of essays and short stories about sentience.
Each essay or story is followed by a short discussion by Hofstadter and/or Dennett.
Some great mind-benders in here.
The two stories by Stanislaw Lem, "The Seventh Sally" and "Non Serviam," are superb; I'd never read Lem before but I'm certainly going to be putting him on my reading lists.
"The Seventh Sally" was an inspiration for SimCity.
Harold Morowitz's "Rediscovering the Mind" is a great comparison of the role of an "observer" in quantum physics with the increasing reductionism in biology that leaves no place for consciousness.
Questa raccolta di articoli curata dagli spumeggianti Hofstadter e Dennett é da molti considerata, e non certo a torto, il manifesto dell'IA forte, ovvero della convinzione che un giorno si potranno avere dei calcolatori realmente coscienti, più o meno come noi.
Molti degli articoli basterebbero da soli ad indurre l'acquisto di questo libro.Tutti insieme formano un vero e proprio capolavoro che non puo' mancare nelle librerie di chiunque si interessi anche solo alla lontana, non importa la formazione, dell'argomento.
It is provocative, but it lacks any real evidence as to a locution of beliefs and selfhood in a neural network.
I think a naturalistic explanation of selfhood borders on insanity.
Not because the evidence is lacking, but rather because I think anyone who tries to tell me who I am simply deserves to be shown the door and asked to leave.
I might enjoy the material more if I did not find the underlying premise an offense.But I do recommend this for anyone who wants to know what an insghtful theory of knowledge is from a naturlistic or monastic viewpoint.
I gave this 4 stars because of the eye-opening points of view that are offered to the reader.The book helps us see outside of our limited perspective.
It's like you are normally walking around your daily life zoomed into YOUR life, your problems, your existence, but then this book comes along and helps you zoom out.
It was hard getting through this but then I'd again be rewarded with a thought experiment that provided me with a new view of the world I inhabit in my mind.If you have delved largely into this subject, this book might not be for you because it largely takes from many other resources on the topic.
The ground he covers encompasses some of the most traditionally intractable problems in philosophy, yet his accounts of the various thought experiments and the issues they do and do not illuminate never appear impenetrable.
This is no fault of the author's, as some of the questions have never been answered and some of them are intrinsically irresolvable.
You'll have a good understanding, though - assuming you do not start with it - of just why they are or are not irresolvable and where philosophy currently stands on them.A masterpiece of erudition and clarity.
Pay particular attention to the preface where Hofstadter writes "Our purpose is not so much to answer the big questions directly as to jolt everyone". This book mostly suggests interesting ideas without expounding on them too deeply, and occasionally stumbles into clarity. I particularly enjoyed "Ant Fugue" by Hofstadter himself, particularly hated "Minds, Brains, and Programs" by Searle, and mildly liked the stimulating nature of all the other selections. This is a book to look at the study of consciousness as a general whole; more specifically, the problems any study of consciousness runs into.
I first read "The Mind's I" in high school and regularly reread its various essays.Even with a quarter-century of age, it hasn't lost any of its luster. Indeed, with advances in cognitive science and neuroscience giving more empirical underpinning to at least a few of the speculations in this book, its mental value has actually increased.Although you may not agree with the philosphical angle of each essay, you won't be able to honestly disagree without having your own cognition and philosophical views deeply scratched and stimulated.
Сборник эссе о том, что значит быть разумным, что значит быть человеком, что значит быть конкретным человеком, собой. Составители сборника держат в голове сравнение человека и машины и ищут ответ на вопрос, есть ли в человеке душа или в нем только "колесики и винтики". Сборник выглядит наполненным умом и состраданием к человеческим метаниям -- и через 35 лет после появления это все еще работа, которую стоит читать.
A tour of a snapshot of cognitive science as it existed in the 1980s, still insightful. Each chapter is an excerpt from another cogsci-related book, the authors post their notes in the reflections section at the end of each chapter. Sometimes they summarize it well, sometimes they completely miss the point.
