Despite its listing, my copy of The Book of Romance ed by Andrew Lang (Blue leather, gold inset illustration on the cover, numerous illustrations by H.J.Ford, Longmans, Green and company) was not published in 1919 but 1915 and the original copyright date is 1902.I like it because it makes an astonishing (and vastly original) single story of as much of the King Arthur legend as is possible.
(I'm trying to write a novel based on this tragedy, circulating through time.) I've always been aware that any myth could be turned into story, but what Lang did with Wayland, whose mentions are few in the old Norse and added to by only one old tale from England that I ever found, is eye-blinkingly astonishing.
I love stories and I appreciated a different side of the stories so many of us already know.
