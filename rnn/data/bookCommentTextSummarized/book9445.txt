The author's experience as a soldier in the Wehrmacht left him as both a front row observer and an active (albeit unwilling and reluctant) participant on what he knew to be an evil cause.The story begins in a German city that suffers a horrific fire bombing (Dresden?).
It was hard reading, and I was glad when the story moved on.From Germany, the guys return to the Eastern Front where, as everyone knows, the fight is not going well.
Having said that, I think this book should be mandatory for everyone that ever wants to join the military or go to war.
A more sensitive translator would have helped, but the poor quality of the prose forbids five stars.Yet Hassel is one of the few who can present the horror of war from the point of view of men who are neither good nor evil, swept up by the war machine and for whom there is no hope, no dignity and above all no redemption because they were on the wrong side.
Most powerful for its chilling banality is the firing squad chapter, where Sven and his comrades share a truck with the old soldier and young female telephonist who know they are on their last journey.It's easy - comforting even - to imagine every member of Hitler's war machine as a monster.
Am inceput cartea cu zambetul pe buze, am mai citit cartile autorului, dar imi aminteam doar momentele comice. A avut autorul grija de zambetul meu.Recomand.
Maybe he meant to say his experience wasn't an exception, but rather the rule.This time there is no excuse for the omission of dates or for the lack of continuity.
They are in training, guard a military unit, form an execution squad, drive tanks, drive cars, form an infantry unit, work in a repair shop, are sent to a military prison, are part of a disciplinary battalion, form rescue parties for civilians, bury the remains of incinerated people, and are - as the story needs them to be - either the most skilled soldiers around or just cannon fodder.
Although entertaining its not for the faint hearted and you're left pondering the madness of war and how as individuals we are mere pawns of higher powers in ivory towers.Given the more enlightened public perspective where government corruption and war is concerned it's hard to see how armies could be raised in the same way again because pacifism if more prevalent in contemporary society and few, except radicalised ethnic groups, have an appetite for war.
That's where this book does a service for humanity in general, it tells people how it really is and why the war cry should be rejected.This book is a good read.
In many ways pulp fiction but the message will reach a lot of people.
Sven Hassel is good at writing these war stories.
They are intense and realistic, brutal and absurd.Hassel shows that not all orders have been obeyed and not all ranks have been respected in wars.
It's the horrors of war that leave the deepest wounds that can't be healed.
And it's dilemmas in war that turn moral principles upside down.I have realised a bit too late that they are a series and I can say that the Legion of the Damned is the deepest of them, while the others just share war stories making use of more or less the same characters.
This was the first full length novel I ever bought and read. I had no idea at the time, the impact this book would have on me. Now forty years later, and a novelist myself, I admit this author probably had more to do with me becoming an author myself, than any other. Wheels of Terror will leave you rolling around the floor in laughter one minute, and the next diving for cover. This author will introduce you to the full horror of war, in a manner that no other novelist could ever hope to achieve. J W Murison
This is Sven Hassel's second book, and takes more of a fictional slant over his first one. The characters are slightly more comic- book, but his vivid description of the horrors of war, and the brutality of life on the eastern front are hard to equal. Beginning with the story of air raids over Hamburg, before moving to Hassel's usual location, fighting the Soviet masses, this novel still has the ability to shock decades after it was written.
This book is bone chillingly real, from a man who was there. I don't understand why it isn't rated way high. The characters are very personable with distinct traits, making each individual even more memorable. The story is gruesome, but real and from a unique point of view. I thought it. Was a great read.
Another rollicking tale of Porta, Tiny, The old Man etc I must of read these books 4/5 times since I was a lad at school Time to re-read I think A strange thing is they are hard to find now all my copys are old and tattered and can only find replacments on second hand stalls?
Tweede boek van hem en ik ben inderdaad fan ruw rauw kortweg een oorlogsverhaal zoals het moet spannend van het begin tot het einde. Soms doet het je huiveren maar toch ook steeds weer boeiend naar het vervolg. Op naar het volgende verhaal als ik deze nog ergens kan vinden natuurlijk.
By reading this you will see the horrors of war up close and personal.In the pages of this masterpiece you will find things that make you laugh,cry,despair and be horrified, An unimaginable roller coaster ride through hell on earth that is modern warfare.
Young men taken from an ordinary world and thrown into an extra ordinary environment.
But they have been chewed up and spat out by the modern military machine and turned into monsters.
They are highly trained soldiers and killing machines, but above all else they are human beings who have been greatly wronged.

I can't quite decide if I should label this one fiction or non-fiction... The author clearly says that he is describing personal experiences, but I do believe he has taken some artistic liberties. As a compromise I'm labeling it as historical, but not non-fictional. The story is a bit of a blur since I read the first two books in the series in a row (and am using this same review for both), but I guess it suffices to say that war is hell indeed and there's no shiny heroics to be found in these books.
I have been sticking with the same sort of war and fighting genre, and this book has been one of the better ones I have read.
Hassel's descriptions of his experiences create a strong view of the horrors of the war, and how it felt for him to be put through it all.Another strong point, and something I rarely feel, was I started to like the characters.
You feel happy or sad when his regiment does.
It may seem weird, but I was actually supporting the German Soldiers over the Russians.I really enjoyed this book, and I would definitely read the other books Hassel has written
It's all in here for the Sven Hassel fans... Tiny, Porta, The Legionnaire, The Old 'Un and Sven himself... all of the usual gang from the 27th Penal Battalion as they fight their way through Russia. This book is brutal and harsh and as good as you will get for WW2 military fiction.
Sven Hassel in his books showed the World War II as it was for soldiers and civilians that were fighting and living on the areas of combat. Brutality, vulgarisms and presenting situation in the way it was without coulouring it up. Great inside story of an ordinary soldier who served in penal unit.
Glorious schlock.
I really enjoyed reading this; it rang true to accounts I have heard from veterans about their experiences in war especially in tank battles. Fast paced...
I'm just hooked to Hassel's books. I like the explicit language and the way human character is put to tryouts in his books. Just amazing!
Terror is the best genre
Read many years ago.gripping but strong and honest depiction of the reality of war
2. Furioso Descriptions of Pluto, Bauer, Beier, Porta, Stege, M�ller and Sven.
Explanation of why they are back at the front (Tiny, the Legionnaire, Porta's raping activity, Pluto's tank driving escapade).
9. At 11.30am The Germans Will Be Blown Sky High Legionnaire, Sven and Porta are sent out to listen to the Russians.
Trying to identify sounds of tanks (arguement between Porta and Pluto).
Pluto, Porta, Tiny, Sven and the Old Un are apparently in a Tiger.
Old Un gets a head wound so Tiny takes over command of tank!!
Porta, Tiny and Legionnaire play dice.
I've read two great war novels detailing the lives of German 'soldaten', the first being 'All Quiet On The Western Front' (from WW1), the second is 'The Willing Flesh' (from WW2).
Sadly I won't be adding 'Wheels of Terror' to this pair of classic books.To be blunt, Hassel (the nom de plume of Danish writer Børge Pedersen) is a master of what I would call 'Wehrmacht Porn', and this book is the epitome (or nadir) of such 'literature'.
With the very occasional moment of bathos, and shallow insights into the utter degradation of people in war, Hassel has written a very ugly, morally bankrupt book.
All up 'Wheels of Terror' is a very ordinary read and a book that I'd not recommend.
Secondo libro di Argberg. Il racconto inizia ad essere più localizzato nel tempo, la narrazione si sposta dal “sé” e abbraccia invece di più gli altri personaggi. Per la prima volta, l’ironia e la comicità la fanno da padrone. Lo stile è cambiato, poiché gli episodi sono meno sconnessi. Due nuovi personaggi sono introdotti: Fratellino/Tiny e il piccolo legionario.
3.5 starsHassel and his comrades in the 27th Penal Regiment continue fighting on the Eastern Front.Well told, with a good mix of characters.The original members of the regiment are jaded and cynical, while the people away from the front see them as nothing more than fodder.Lots of action, with some brutal scenes and the dark humour that helps them get through each assignment.
About the same as the other Cassell booksThese Casserole books are similar. they are worth reading if you like a lot of action and unrealistic survival rates of the main characters.
5 din 5.
Cada capítulo es una aventura o anécdota del comando protagonista, sin mucha cohesión entre todos.
Aún así, y a pesar de ser serie B o Z, tiene mucha más verdad en sus páginas que muchos libros más intelectualizados.
Se muestra con una crudeza sin censura, la deshumanización a la que cualquier guerra provoca en los implicados.
Hassel consigue también que los soldados nazis protagonistas (aunque ellos detestan a los nazis y a Hitler), a cual más bestia y sanguinario, te caigan bien.
I've read so many of Sven Hassel's war stories.
All I do know is that I read and loved the characters of Porta, Tiny, The Old Man (Sometimes The Old Un) With Sven telling the story in the first person singular.
The author participates in the deadly and horrific battles.
The black humour during the lull of the fighting can give the reader real gut-busting laughs.
Sometimes the violence leaves the reader feeling cold and disgusted.
The battle scenes take no prisoners.
So to any potential reader; this is pulp war fiction with a difference.
It is not cosy cartoon violence.
