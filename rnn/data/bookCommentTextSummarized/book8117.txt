Tolstoy stars here as the villainous hero of his own life story, my abiding memory is the sense that Troyat didn't much like his subject, admittedly this memory coming from his description of Tolstoy's wedding, he married the daughter of a woman he had once asked to marry when he was a young man and having been turned down by the mother popped up years later to carry off the daughter, by which time he had made a name for himself as a writer, but had also been treated several times for syphilis, had lost all his teeth(view spoiler)[ possibly an effect of the use of Mercury to treat the syphilis (hide spoiler)] and had grown his famous beard(view spoiler)[ possibly to hide the sunken toothless cheeks, or maybe he didn't care much for shaving (hide spoiler)].
Thus Tolstoy became increasingly judgmental and paralyzed, and to read an intimate portrayal of his later years becomes excruciating -- even setting aside the chaotic pressures provided by his wife, family, and disciples.
The reader trusts Troyat, as he hangs his finely woven tale on a solid structure of primary sources, but the reader is aware that any biographer of Tolstoy will have to take a side in presenting these final, awful years.
Troyat's account is less flattering to both Tolstoy and Sonya than is the recent film that depicts these last years but has to it the unresolved complexity of truth.
One of the top three biographies I've ever read in my life. Almost liked it as much as reading Tolstoy
Troyat's 700-plus pages biography reads like a Tolstoy novel. It follows Tolstoy's life in detail, quoting extensively from his and his family's copious diaries. His marriage, which started happily enough, and then turned into a nightmare for both him and his wife was morbidly fascinating. It was like watching a slow train wreck. Altogether, a satisfiying if rather lengthy portrait of a complicated genius.
When you read about what your favorite author's life was like in real life you get a better picture of how they became who they are and a little more on how the characters came to life. Interesting how a lot of those characters match people they knew in real life.
One of the most extensive biogrpahies I have ever read - this book is monumental in scope but precise in its detail.
I'd never read any tolstoy until I took a survey class my Freshman year - the Life and Art of Lev Tolstoy with the head of our Slavic Languages department at GW.
It honestly changed my life, and this book was the main part of it.
There is so much to learn - he had such an interesting life - that there is always more to know about him.
Wonderful book.
His disciples were in constant conflict with his wife and family as to who controlled access to the great man and who could profit from his literary endeavours.
One telling example: in the account of Tolstoy's wedding to Sonya, Troyat lets slip that the great man had already had a son with Axinya, one of the serfs on the family estate - and there is no further examination of this, apart from its effect on Sonya's state of mind (already somewhat perturbed by reading Tolstoy's secret diaries, a detail later written into Anna Karenina).I am sure that better biographies of Tolstoy have since been written.
Troyat is the greatest biographer I've read--and not just because he's covered pretty much all of the Russian writers and tsars... (though, yes, that was pretty swell of him to do...) He doesn't just spit out facts, he tells a story... I only wish more of his bios were available in English.
"La Lev Tolstoi, nevoia de a fi impotriva opiniei generale devenise o a doua natura. Ca si cum, print-o contrazicere sistematica, si-ar fi dovedit propria sa existenta. Parea ca spune: 'Gindesc pe dos decit ceilalti, deci exist!'"
Reading this wonderful biography of Tolstoy is almost better than reading a Tolstoy novel. His life was an adventure, and the way he wove his own life into his books is fascinating.
A thoroughly researched and detailed telling of Count Tolstoy's life and work, Henri Troyat's biography of Russia's greatest novelist is an incredible masterpiece.
The author weaves a wonderfully written and critical story of Tolstoy's creative development, deteriorating marriage, and spiritual evolution that at times makes the Count the villain in his own life.
He gives each a particular way of thinking and talking, a physical appearance, a weight in live flesh, a past even an odor.
Here, however, they are identified and animated with such skill that they continue to live and love in our memories after we have closed the book.' (p.
Henri Troyat's biography of Tolstoy is the one to read... probably one of the top literary biographies ever. I recommend also reading his 'Firebrand:The Life of Dostoyevsky'. Then reread Crime and Punishment, Notes From the Underground, Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, Devils. You gain insight into how they both prophesied the socialist/communist state by more than forty years. Then read Solzhenitsyn. Then Anna Politkovskaya's 'A Russian Diary'. And witness why “Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.”
Rendkívül precízen Tolsztojnak szinte minden napjáról tudósít hitelesnek tekinthető források (naplók, levelek, visszaemlékezések, életrajzok) alapján.
Sokat megtudhattam a világ egyik legnagyobb írójáról, de nem állíthatom, hogy megszerettem a személyiségét.
Rendszeresen különféle erkölcsi, életvezetési fogadalmakat tett, ezekre azonban többnyire már másnap nem is emlékezett.
Nagy kártyás, rendszeresen vagyonokat vesztett, birtokait eladni kényszerült, hogy kifizethesse hatalmas kártyadósságait.
Egy birtokán élő férjes jobbágynőt a szeretőjévé tett, „törvénytelen” fiával nem törődött, az cselédként szolgálta őt.
Érdekes volt megtudni, hogy ez az íróóriás mennyire nehezen, keservesen írt, hosszú alkotói válságokat élt át, nagyregényei megjelenésének szüneteiben sokszor évekig nyűglődött, kínlódott.
With Tolstoy's penchant for writing a diary throughout his life and his voluminous correspondence a biographer has much material to work with.
What comes out of all of this is similar to that which comes out when just about any famous figure's life is minutely examined.
Despite the achievements the famous person has flaws and difficulties no different than non-celebrities.
Tolstoy's fictional characters commonly being based upon different aspects of the people around him in real life and in different aspects of himself.
It describes the thousands of people who showed up ion New York to welcome Roosevelt back from his trip to Africa.
That may seem odd to say of a biography, as his life was his life, and Tolstoy is a difficult character, but Troyat editorializes the events not impartially.
I gained tremendous respect for Sonya, Tolstoy's wife, and my love and respect for Tolstoy himself were challenged, but I'll read the works of other biographers, as well as Tolstoy's diaries before significantly altering my reverence for the man.If you're looking for a thorough picture of the man, and one which is critical and completely devoid of rose-colored glasses, this is highly recommended.

This is an exhausting and exhaustive biography on the great Leo Tolstoy. I am a Tolstoy lover, so this book made the man behind the great works very real, with all of his hypocrises and true passions. His manic-depressive relationship with his wife put a lot of strain on him. He wanted to live a peaceful life, but his own voracious passions, and his fame, prevented him from fading away into a commune. Although there were already Tolstoyan communes in the Caucausus region. I have read this book twice.
Wow, this is really in-depth, almost a day by day account. It took me a while to read because of the amount of info crammed onto each page. I've loved all of Troyat's books, that I've read. My fear after reading this is that all other biographies will seem like they're skimming the surface. It did a good job of showing Tolstoy as a young man as well as the bearded old man that he is so often thought of.
Despite its length, and despite the fact that it is translated from the French, this biography is wonderfully readable. It depicts Tolstoy with a critical eye, and Troyat shares with his reader his amusement at Tolstoy's inconsistent and hypocritical character. The selections from Tolstoy's diaries are also well chosen.
I read this book when I was 14 and loved it. As an adult, I found an inexpensive used copy and snatched it up. Tolstoy was an interesting person and an excellent writer. Troyat made Tolstoy's life come alive for me and made me want to read Tolstoy's books. After this biography I ploughed through every Tolstoy book I could get my hands on.
Awesome. A biography with so much "life," even Tolstoy would have approved, I bet. Flowing, beautiful, complex language - harmonious with Tolstoy's style and compatible with the depth in which his life is described. Tolstoy was more of a revolutionary than I knew. A short interesting fact: Princess Marya from War and Peace was modeled after his own mother.
From his profligate youth (addicted gambler, screwed his brains out with anything female that crossed his path) to moral compass...this is a wonderful biography of the "spiritual journey" - a term I cringe to use - of a great author. If War and Peace is to imposing, try his short stories or my personal favorite "Resurrection"
Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Bevel.
This is an exhaustive and excellent biography of Tolstoy.
Really interesting book about Russian history with revelations which will explain America today, and I've read many history books.
This is an incredibly crazy story of an incredibly crazy life.
I'm reading this biography while reading Anna Karenina.
This biography of the famous Russian paints him as a vain literary genius wasting away a fortune with a profligate lifestyle and feeling really guilty about it.
Wow. What a life. So beautifully written by Troyat.
Am re reading for the third time in 40 years.It just gets better. It's more of a Tolstoyannovel than the real thing. I also re read JayParini's "The Last Station" recently too.
