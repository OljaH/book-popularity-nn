After the terrible, terrible experience I had with Eleventh Hour (overall assessment: don't read that book even if you are forced to), I had to come back with a decent mystery.
As Maggie settles into Nuala's home, she begins to realize that maybe the murder wasn't random and that maybe it was connected to the death of Greta Shipley, one of Nuala's friends living at a retirement center, Latham Manor.Good:Mary Higgins Clark writes and writes well.
No ha conseguido atraparme como otros libros de la autora. No sé si es porque ya voy conociendo su estilo pero he sabido desde el primer momento quien era el culpable.Sin embargo, sí me ha gustado cómo ha ido entretejiendo las otras tramas para que luego todo tuviera un único hilo conductor.
Rating it a 3 because although it was a good story, figuring out the antagonist was too facile. He just disappeared from the storyline for awhile. Highly questionable Maggie Holloway connects with a stepmother from childhood who winds up murder. She investigates the murder along with a few others who all have Victorian grave bells left on their tombstones. Side story of stock fraud It all comes together at the end very well. No argument with that.
I love Mary Higgins Clark as a good palate cleanser, and a sure way to get me excited about reading again! This book did the trick perfectly!
Another excellent story by MHC and the completion of her entire bibliography for me. I am going to go back and start reading them all again.
Boring and predictable. I have to say that I skimmed through it because I have no time for bad books.
First of all, Maggie is very boring and of course MHC paints her in a perfect light.
Second, I didn't buy into the whole closest of Maggie and Nuula's relationship.
Also Nuula ended up leaving Maggie everything in her will, which seemed odd to me, because again if someone is that important to you why not find them sooner?!
I was surprised that the police didn't look into Maggie, because again Nuula changed her will the other week, leaving everything to Maggie.This novel is questing my decision to read all MHC's novels.
Not bad, but overall kind of on the forgettable side.
The first three pages in the beginning were great, but it was pretty slow up until the last third of the story.
Maggie wasn't all that interesting to read either - not a lot of depth there.
And it was pretty easy to work out who the villain was pretty much right out of the gate - not a whole lot of mystery.
I think I would classify this as a light waiting room, bus, or airplane read.
Engrossing read - some chilling moments. So why 3 stars? A lot of characters and information to track; connection between H/h not fully developed - one or two previous meetings and then a somewhat psychic connection I just didn't buy. On the other hand, I didn't guess the villain until 70% - it kept my interest and I continued reading. I did enjoy some of the info on ancient, historical, and/or cultural burial practices.
I was disappointed. It's very easy to work out who the villain is, the characters are shallow and really I don't think it's well-written at all. This book is like a holiday romance with a few murders thrown in.I have read other books by Mary Higgins Clark and don't remember them being as ordinary as this one.

Reaction (Book)Just like her other books, it introduces a lot of characters which makes it so hard to keep track of. She introduced them in a very detailed way that would make you think he/she was the bad guy. What a great technique eh? Her style of “who done it” never fails to amaze me. Reading it for the second time never gave me the convenience to guess the real suspect. It really just proves that Mary Higgins Clarks’ writing skills is really unpredictable. The title “Americas Queen of Suspen
It is just a kind of story that gets even better as the page number increases.Putting a little something of romance in this suspense/thriller book is my favorite!
It is what every happy ending sucker like me wants for every story.Reaction (Author & Plot)Mary Higgins Clark is well known as Americas Queen of Suspense.
And I’m sure its going to be pretty hard to forget the story just like how I always remember her book entitled Loves Music, Loves to Dance.
I always like how she put a lot of twists in the story making it harder to guess the suspect/s.
Not sure what the title has to do with anything apart from of COURSE moonlight becomes Maggie Holloway, since Maggie Holloway is such a Mary Sue and everybody loves her (although she mysteriously has no family or friends in the story apart from two guys who are both in love with her and a Stepmother she hasn't seen since she was a child).Maggie is fantastic at sculpting clay.
well you know how these things go.Some of the plot was complex and I would have given it an extra star for that except that the gender stereotypes were even more regressive than average (all women are beautiful and want to be wives of dominant men) and the social politics (apolitically presented of course) of the book jarred.
Another must read novel by Ms. Clark.
Beginning with Odile Lane, the woman who looked like an empty-brain person and turned out to be easily manipulated, a robot.
Same with Dr. Lane, Malcolm had many flaws in his profession but it doesn't make him a bad person.
The man who was described by his wife as a perfect example of a 'Ken doll', a metaphor that I came to like in this novel.
Janice Norton, Malcolm's wife, the woman who regretted her total affair with her husband.
And now he found the perfect time but Maggie Holloway's life is endangered.
I will not make fun of Clark's novels as I usually do - stupid to do if I am reading them - because as much as they are cotton candy for the brain, without anything meaningful, memorable, or approaching profound, they are always mildly interesting and in a stressful week (state testing for my students) they are a somewhat fun diversion.
The only difference is that Street is set in Spring Lake, NJ, very close to where I reside, and there is some mystery surrounding women who died a hundred years earlier, and Moonlight is set in Newport.
Maybe it is time for newer cotton candy.
Morning Becomes You is a perfect bus ride, waiting room, kind of book.
She becomes suspicious of a few other deaths at the local nursing home.The most interesting character in the book is Earl Bateman and this because of his interest in death customs, about which he lectures at the local collage.
Vincent Price would seem an obvious choice for Earl Bateman, but I’d choose Thomas Mitchell.
(I suspect that most reading this cast of characters are asking, “Who?”)I’m not spoiling anything by saying that the book has a happy ever after ending.
These kinds of books always do.
Pretty good twists. Was a tad longer than necessary. Stupidly romantic, which I begrudgingly enjoyed. Some creep factor but not enough.
I’ve picked it up more than a dozen times and managed to read to the 25% mark.
By page 49, approximately twenty-five characters are introduced—most wealthy & many aspiring to be wealthier.
Too many characters and it’s only page 49.
Maggie likes Il Tinello (said Liam), went to boarding school & Carnegie-Mellon, and rubs along comfortably with wealthy blue bloods in Newport.
Maggie is used a wealthy life, seems to be a perfect person, everyone seems to love/like her, and three men are lusting for her.
Before the plot managed to manifest itself, I was bored.
A very tightly wound murder mystery, with an unlikely assassin. You learn about customs surrounding death from one of the creepy characters in the story. Our heroine is smart and a little too daring. The Queen of suspense has once again written a very intriguing book.
Not my favorite MHC novel, but a damned good one that I've re-read multiple times. I quite like Maggie and I didn't guess the murderer or the reasons for the murders until the end, always a nice treat for someone who reads so many mysteries. I also love the Rhode Island setting, and I wish MHC would write more books set on the shore.
But, just reading Mary Higgins Clark take on this topic in this novel had sometimes made me laugh, sometimes shiver and sometimes shed a tear.Another thing that I liked about this was the male interest of Maggie, who had more to perform than just go on a few dates with the heroine.
Mary Higgins Clark has given some meat and bones to the character which adds more to the story.I was glad I picked this up after the last one I read which was utterly boring.
Maggie Holloway, the main character, finds her long lost stepmother at a party and agrees to come and visit her at her home in Newport, Rhode Island.
The characters were interesting and the plot was good and well researched.
Evan so, it wasn't as good as some of Mary Higgins Clarks' stories.
It is good enough to read at least once.
I don't know if I will ever read this again.
A book USUALLY has to be really good for me to read it again.
Thank you for reading and please comment below and let me know what you think about this book.
Using her skills as a photographer to aid her in uncovering the secrets hidden on the grave sites, she soon realizes that Nuala's death may not have been a random killing at all but rather part of a diabolical plot conceived by a twisted and unfeeling mind.It kept me guessing who the real killer was.
And what I like the most, it seemed real.
The author really knows how to frighten us to death.With every twist and turn, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat.
When Maggie gets there she is frightend by the sight of her stepmother, Nula, murdered by someone.
When Maggie inherited Nulas house, she starts t suspect that her death was in spite of something.
Maggie spend her whole time finding out who killed her stepmother and why.During this book i made a text-to-world connection.
In the book Maggie tries to find out who killed her stepmother.
Which is exactly what Maggie did.I'd rate this book 3 stars.
But i didnt rate it stars becuase it was a little slow when Maggie starts to doubt herself.
Meh
Buried alive - everyone's nightmare! Maggie is delighted when she is reunited with her stepmother. However, when before they can catch up again she Nuala is murdered. When Maggie starts to look in to the murder she is led to a nursing home where there have been several recent unexpected deaths. A gripping mystery - Mary Higgings Clark never disappoints!
All M.H.C. books have the same theme, attractive smart woman as main character unknowingly in a lot of danger while you meet a few attractive male characters. One of the male characters is the killer, the other the love interest and you don't get to know which is which until the end. (If you don't figure it out in the first 3 chapters.)
MOONLIGHT BECOMES YOU - VGClark, Mary Higgins - standaloneMaggie Holloway is unsatisfied with the explanation for her former stepmother's death, and when the residents of a nursing home begin dying suddenly and inexplicably she becomes suspicious. It is only later that she realizes she herself is a target for a twisted killer.This was one of her best books in awhile. Good suspense.
I used to like her books but this one just didn't hold me. A woman goes to visit her former step-mother, finds her murdered and lots of old ladies start dropping at a nursing home. There were so many characters I got lost.
I just finished this book last night and I couldn't put it down. I love all of her books because they are all a mystery, but not too scary. The end was very exciting and my heart was pounding as it all unraveled. Great read!
