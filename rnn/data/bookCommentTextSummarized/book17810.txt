AMAZINGI mean after such brilliant first two books of the series; Reason to Breathe and Barely Breathing, we get such a shitty third novel: Out of Breath.
Wtv they were 'keeping' from each other was so fucking stupid I wanted to hit someone.I am just to angry and irritated at the moment because this book was so bad.
I was like 'are you fucking kidding me?!' One of the worst endings I've read.
I hope we freakin' get a novella or something after that shitty ending.

With Emma and Evan HAPPY!
Reading this review have been with Emma and Evan since the beginning.
In book three, Emma attempts to rebuild her heart all on her own but she just can't.(view spoiler)[ She never could built it back on her own.
Two years later Emma is still struggling with her broken heart, the voices in her head and is struggling just to survive…Emma isn’t living, she is just Breathing, an empty shell of the girl she used to be."She’s just been … existing since she left Weslyn.
You’re here because … it’s where you belong, with her.’"Emma was frustrating at times, so much that I wanted to scream at her or shake her out of it.I do understand what she’s been to and that she’s DROWNING in her hurt and pain and is STRUGGLING to see the LIGHT, to Find her Breath…"Breathe, Emma.
New emotions are created in these moments.Time stops in these moments.We lose ourselves in these moments...We all shared this moment at the end of Reason to Breathe Our happily ever after was ripped away only to be replaced by emotions we didn't even know existed.
I wanted to open the book and fall right into Emma and Evan.
Emma and Evan have the exact same moment at the exact same time (okay maybe not exactly at the same time, that would just be cray cray, but you get the picture).
And the winner of the biggest book disappointment of the year goes to.....Out of Breath by Rebecca Donovan!!!And to think this was probably my most anticipated book release of 2013!!Yeah....instead, here I am!
The Emma almost two years after SHE left Evan!!Listen Emma...cut the shit!All the drinking--it's NOT ATTRACTIVE.
--What are the odds that Evan's BFFs live 3 houses down from Cole and  that Emma will just "happen" to go to a party there?
She didn't drink at all the first year and half after she left Evan but now she's constantly drunk?!?!?!
And why are all of her friends acting like it's their fault that Emma's drinking?!?!
~EvanIf you thought reading through the abuse Emma suffered was bad..Well reading while she lives in this..this constant state of depression was just as bad.Both Sara and Evan fight to free Emma from the firm grip she holds on to death and quite frankly it is very sad.Out of Breath will leave some fans mad, others sadly disappointed, few satisfied and most just a plain old wreck.
My Thoughts-First things first though, I need to know if Cole will be getting his own book, seriously I fell hard for his character and I would love to see him happy.
And even though I loved Cole’s character I felt that he and Emma had more romance scenes then her and Evan.
4 Still Breathing Stars It’s been two years since Emma left Weslyn and went to Stanford for school. Two years since she’s left the past behind her, cutting off essentially everyone and everything except Sara and her roommates. She has been existing, but not living. Ever since she left her old life, ever since she left Evan, she’s been barley hanging on.  Emma is on a seriously self destructive path. Emma is out of control. Doing things she swore she would never do, acting out in ways I never ex
It’s been two years since Emma left Weslyn and went to Stanford for school.
We have Emma who is acting out, Cole trying to be there for her, and Evan back into the picture.
Emma doesn’t know what to do with herself, so she does what she does best.
Regardless, Evan knows that he and Emma belong together, even if she doesn’t see it.
Evan makes it his mission to show Emma that she deserves happiness, love, she deserves him.
I understood why Emma was in so much pain and doing the things she was doing, I did.
Evan saved the book for me.
Disappointed-- 3 Stars for the writing not the story lineIt feels like I’ve been waiting forever for this final installment of Rebecca Donovan’s Breathing Series.
without Sara and her roommates I don’t think Emma would be functioning or even breathing.
It was frustrating to read and absolutely heartbreaking to bear after all that a reader endured in the first two books.Events bring Emma back in Weslyn where Evan and her paths meet up again.
Emma agrees to give Evan two weeks to convince him to hate her and tell him the truth.
Slowly Emma lets Evan in and gives him the truths that he has so desperately needed.
I didn't like Emma in this book at all.
The book starts off a year and a half after Emma ran away from Evan and went to California.
It's not so much that I didn't get why she was self medicating, but it just seemed bizarre that she was ok for almost two years, and then *bam* alchi/adrenaline junkie Emma comes to life.
It just left me wondering what the heck was so special about Emma  (hide spoiler)]After Evan comes back into Emma's life we enter the most frustrating part of the book.

ATTENTION, PEOPLE :Rebecca Donovan has just changed the cover for OUT OF BREATH:And, we also have a new teaser-------->OUT OF BREATH Teaser:I closed my eyes, my chest tightening, knowing I wasn't ready.
I was afraid to lose this – his touch, his warmth.His hand ran across my stomach, and I inhaled quickly.
His fingers coiled into a fist on my stomach, and his arm tightened in restraint.
"Maybe I should go upstairs."Just as he turned on his back, I uttered, "Don’t go." He was suddenly very still.
We’re not ready.
And I don’t know what’s happening between us.
How are you going to end a book like that and then expect us to wait? It was bad enough we had wait for the second installment! But on a side note: what a fantastic series so far. Absolutely loved both of the books and can't wait to read the final chapter on Emma and Evan.
4.5 OUT OF BREATH stars“You were my reason to breathe.” This is the third book in the Breathing series. This is the story of Evan and Emma. Emma is BROKEN. Her HELL started when she was 11 yrs old and had to move in with her aunt and uncle. She later, meets Evan who in the end....SAVES her. The first two books ended with massive cliffy's and left me heartbroken, but FINALLY after waiting a very long, 12 months... I get my happily ever after. This book had me crying, laughing, screaming and lastl
“In the uneven balance of life, I'd experienced love and loss.
And although I didn't know what had happened to her, I knew I had to find out.”“Living in the mistakes of your past isn't going to do anything but destroy your future.”“Maybe it's because once you put all the pieces together, you end up with something beautiful.” “In the uneven balance of life, I'd experienced love and loss.
I chose to live.
I chose to love.
I chose to breathe.” 
Even when your weren't there to save me, you were my reason to breathe.
4.5 ★'sAt the end of the last book, you know some horrible things had happened and that Emma took off to Stanford...and that's where I've been left hanging for the past year - imagining all sorts of scenarios that could be played out.
It was a little scary seeing these two broken people possibly try to work things out.
It warmed my heart to read about the things Evan just knew would work for Emma...just goes to show that sometimes it takes people that really know you, to know what can help you.
Dark, raw, and just as gripping as the first two!It’s been two years since Emma left Evan alone and broken and time has not healed her wounds. Despite putting on a brave face for her supportive roommates and Sara, she knows she hanging on by a thread. The hate, anger, hurt, and guilt, are drowning her and although she continues to fight, she knows that soon enough, she’s going to let it pull her under.   … I was feeling again. Way too much. And I was afraid. So very afraid of what might happen n
Dark, raw, and just as gripping as the first two!It’s been two years since Emma left Evan alone and broken and time has not healed her wounds.
So very afraid of what might happen next if I wasn’t able to tuck everything back into the darkness, where it all belonged.
I got to hand it to him, he was still angry and heartbroken over what Emma put him through, but once he knew how far gone she was, Evan instantly put his feeling aside to help her.
EvanIf your expecting Evan and Emma to see each other and instantly get together again, you have another thing coming.
This morning there was a piece of news I’ve been expecting to hear for AGES now (about three weeks actually, when I finished “Barely breathing”, but I tend to overreact) plastered on my Facebook wall:“Out of breath” expected publication date has FINALLY been released.OH MY DEAR GODNESS THANK YOU, THANK YOOOOOU! Or so I thought, at first, just to have my poor unadvised heart shattered into small pulsating blooded bits, because when my eyes darted greedly to the release date it read: june 2013.FREAKING JUNE 2013!How I am suposed to wait this long
JUNE 13TH 2013?!?!?!?!?!?!?! WHY GOD WHY?!?!
It breaks my heart to give a one star review to this series’ conclusion, but in the end I’m disappointed with this series finale, I expected more or something I clearly didn’t find in Out of Breath.Spoiler Alert >>> Read at Your Own Caution"Focus on the journey, not the destination." -Greg AndersonOut of Breath started almost two years ago since the end of Barely Breathing.
Here’s where as a reader I felt it’s too much telling and not showing, she is constantly saying that when she was truly happy was two years ago with Evan, that she still loves him but there’s nothing in her development that shows that.
3 STARS RATING Out of Breath BY Rebecca Donovan ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*I am a huge fan of the breathing series.
and i know how this writer writes.I know her style but there was something off about this one!Then the rest of the book was great, i loved it.
I couldn't destroy you too."     " Let me love you.
Let me love you enough for the two of us, until you can accept that you're worth it.
***Unfulfilled, Slow-Paced Stars***This is straight up BULLSHIT!!Out Of Breath, is not a tear jerker. It's the complete opposite. The sadness is due to MY complete disappointment with the book.  Now, now peeps!!!! It's not what you think. Unfortunately, this is not a review of the book. So if you were looking for a synopsis or summary, you have come to the wrong place!!!!!! This is a FULL ON RANT & BITCHING on my part. I am saddened for numerous reasons but let me entertain you with the reas
The sadness is due to MY complete disappointment with the book.
I am saddened for numerous reasons but let me entertain you with the reasons as to why: The bad:It was insanely boringThings seemed to drag on foreverEmma was a total b*tchEvan is too damn forgiving for Emma's idiotic behavior.The constant nagging and whining from EmmaEmma's lack of awareness.Emma's reasoning for pushing EvanETC......The way the SERIES ENDED.And countless other things that cannot be said due to spoilers.OUT OF BREATH, did not deliver!!!!
ENUFF said......THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY IN THIS BOOK IS EVAN *sigh*Its unfortunate really, this book was one of the most anticipated books of the year and it was a HUGE disappointment.
Do I regret reading Out of Breath?
I fell in love with Evan and Emma a long time ago and they are still two of my most beloved characters.
This Author completely blew my mind when I picked up ‘Reason to Breathe’ and I will never forget the anxiety, fear, love and compassion I felt from the first breath I shared with these characters.I urge every reader out there who reads this review to pick up this series, if you haven’t already.
You will want to wrap your arms protectively around your kindle wishing that this action, in itself, would give some comfort, love and shelter to these characters which come alive through this Author’s brilliant writing.
Five Stunningly Beautiful Stars (This review assumes you know the story of Emma & Evan in the first 2 books) “I’d earned every aching beat that pounded in my chest.” Out of Breath, for me, is a truly fabulous read; I absolutely loved it. It's bursting with emotions and feelings all wrapped up in a bundle of LOVE ♥I know not everyone has felt the same about this book and I completely understand the reasons why but I thought it was stunning; this is what I thought and why  I LOVED IT!! First
(This review assumes you know the story of Emma & Evan in the first 2 books)
He sadly didn't make a proper appearance for quite some time in Out of Breath but his presence, I felt, was always there.Emma has small flashbacks to her life with Evan and the life she left behind.
~ Emma about ColeI have to say a fell a little in love with him but those who know the story will understand it, when I say he is NO MATCH for Evan ♥ So I waited & waited, felt a little sorry for Cole, and was finally rewarded with Evan and his almighty, gorgeous presence!!
Ok, I think this is a prime example of it being so long between books that you kind of forget what happened.
3.5 stars!
"To breathing!" Serena raised her shot glass to mine.
I remember feeling as though I'd had my heart ripped out of my chest, at the end of book #2, but I couldn't remember a lot of the details, because an awful lot happened.
So, seeing as book #3 focused a lot on the things that happened in book #2, I spent a lot of Out of Breath racking my brain.
I had a quick flick through t
we're all waiting to read this book about Emma and Evan getting their HEA...
So, I knew I wanted Evan, but I knew, for that to happen, Cole was either going to have to turn into an asshole, or get seriously hurt.
and I was like 'Argh, no, I don't want ANY of those things to happen.' So, it was inevitable, someone was going to end up in tears...
I felt like I didn't recognise Emma's character in this book, but I do think that that was kind of the point.
Every choice had a consequence. I'd earned every aching beat that pounded in my chest. I seriously don't know how I feel about this book. I know for sure I read the first two books in this series last summer, a whole year ago, and absolutely adored them. They were like an emotional train wreck I just couldn't look away from. But it took forever for this book in the series to even have a release date, and when it finally got one it was ages away. Lucky for me, I have like 1700 books on my TBR li
I know for sure I read the first two books in this series last summer, a whole year ago, and absolutely adored them.
I mean sure, that's how long it felt like I waited but I couldn't believe the story skipped ahead that far.
But when one night the box holding her past literally opens it's like something in Emma comes apart too.
I felt so bad for the guy, it was like she was just using him, because it is obvious she is never truely going to ever let anyone in.
I just don't know how.""You don't have to let me, Emma.
She wants to feel something, anything so she can breathe again.Emma has a great support system in a group of girlfriends, who are also her roommates.
I hate that I actually started to like Cole because I knew he wouldn’t be around for long.As though Emma didn't have enough tragedy in her life, the blows keep on coming.
Evan’s back in Emma’s life and he wants, no - scratch that, NEEDS answers.
He ends up in California with Emma and I wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved to have him in the picture finally or to tell him to run away as fast as possible.
It was just utter disappointment.I mean I was looking forward to the end of the series so badly ..I knew Donovan was going to bring a great finale.
But now, not so much.I do not understand how she can trust other guys but Evan - Jonathan now Cole.
I love Emma, but this book just did not do her the same justice as the other two.
Angry at Emma for the decisions she made throughout this book (even though in the beginning her daring side was nice).
Angry at Evan, for being OK with this.
Only because, I really do not want this book to exist as the ending.
Rebecca, I'm going to cry...
You are going to turn me into blubbering MESS.
I need this book now and as I can see, I'm not the only one having a breakdown full of tantrums of torrential proportions.
I don't think we can handle the pressure of waiting til next year.
How do people earn those advance copies I keep hearing of...
I gotta comfort my Emma and NOW MY EVAN.
Man, patience is a virtue I have purposely skipped out on on learning.
Book lovers are the worst I'm afraid.
We need instant gratification.
Sniff sniff
I cannot wait until this book comes out...I mean, after the cliffhanger in book 1, it killed me just to wait for book 2 and now that Emma suddenly left Evan??? WTFFFF!!!! why oh why did u leave him???
OMG I need to know what happens!! 'Scuse me while I go stockpile the Xanax..
