Carnap wants you to know that there's something fishy about philosophy.
Therefore it doesn't discuss essences.
Almost without knowing anything, one can easily see this to be false: that science, unless it's descriptive, in which case it's science by metaphorical extension only, is going to discuss essences (that is, after all, why Galileo abstracts from air resistance - to get at the essence of falling bodies).
Since science discusses essences (clearly), a fortiori philosophy will (and a whole bunch of other things).
Obviously Carnap and his fellow positivists aren't exactly philosophically fashionable these days, but he's definitely worth a read! So much of contemporary metaphysics is set up in opposition to him that it's healthy to get a sense of his arguments on his own terms.
An interesting and profound study.
