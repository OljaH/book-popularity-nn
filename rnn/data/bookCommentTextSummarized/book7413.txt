Βαθμολογία: ★Αυτό το βιβλίο είναι ένα ψέμα! Αγαπητέ Japrisot, άλλο να βάζεις αναξιόπιστο αφηγητή και άλλο να μας κοροϊδεύεις κατάμουτρα! Εγώ φταίω που μου άρεσε κιόλας στην αρχή και δεν ήξερα ο άνθρωπος για να το παρατήσω εγκαίρως. Όλο αυτό το «τι έκανε; ποιος το έκανε; δεν το έκανε; τελικά μήπως το έκανε; α δεν το έκανε;» το μόνο που κατάφερε ήταν να με συγχύσει και να με εκνευρίσει. Δεν απορώ πάντως με τις θετικές κριτικές. Ο συγγραφέας προσπαθεί να σε πείσει ότι τάχα έχει γράψει ένα «έξυπνο» μυθιστόρημα. Ε, εγώ δεν το έχαψα!
Japrisot falls to the mystery novel trap of building up an immensely intriguing and suspenseful narrative that he has to then tear apart clumsily in the last 30 pages to explain himself.
The first two "acts" are stunning psychological noir material, fast-paced and full of character intricacies, secrets, and neuroses; an absolute thrill to read, the kind that forces your hand to keep turning the pages.
However, the final act is a gaping flaw in every aspect from character to suspense to plausibility to atmosphere and so on.
I'd like to read more of his work if I can find translations somewhere in this city....
He creates intricate plots with complex characters and the story moves in a way that you just don't want to stop reading.
This is probably my all time favorite book of his (although I have yet to read them all--I'm working my way through them).What I love most about this book is that you are constantly questioning whether Dany is telling the truth or if she is crazy.
It's done so well that you want to keep reading so that you find out the truth.
Japrisot weaves such a great plot that's equal parts mystery and psychological thriller that you are sucked into the book and don't want to leave.
Koks žavus šios knygos viršelis!
Žinoma ir dėmesį traukiantis knygos pavadinimas 🤓 Su šio autoriaus kūryba dar nebuvau susipažinusi, nors galbūt esate skaitę jo knygą “Pinklės pelenei”.
Dabar ir aš planuoju ją perskaityti.
Istorija pasakoja apie Dani, kuri gauna užduotį nuvežti savo šefą į oro uostą, ir atgal parvairuoti jo automobilį į Paryžių.
Tačiau kelionę temdo keisti įvykiai, kuriuos sunku paaiškinti.
Beskaitant šią knygą sužinojau, jog ši knyga buvo parašyta 1966 metais.
Jau vien tai pasirodė labai įdomu 🤓 Šis psichologinis detektyvas iš ties painus, su nenuspėjamais įvykiais.
Intriga išlaikyta iki pat knygos pabaigos.
Tokios pabaigos net ir aš nesitikėjau..
Το τελείωσα από καθαρά ψυχαναγκαστικούς λόγους, απλώς για να το τελειώσω. Απίστευτα κουραστική διήγηση, απίστευτα παρατραβηγμένο και τρελό σενάριο, απίστευτα τακτοποιημένο τέλος "όπως μας βολεύει" και μάλλον απίστευτες ήταν και οι ποσότητες των ναρκωτικών που κατανάλωνε ο συγγραφέας όταν το έγραφε...
Ο κ. Japrisot γράφει πολύ καλά. Εχει στυλ! Αλλά αν θες να διαβάσεις ένα αστυνομικό τραβηγμένο απ τα μαλλιά, διάλεξες το σωστό βιβλίο. Ασκοπες φλυαρίες στα πρώτα 2/3 της ιστορίας, που σε φτάνουν στα όρια του εκνευρισμού και μια λύση που πιο απίθανη δεν γίνεται. Εκτός αν διάβασα μια ιστορία επιστημονικής φαντασίας και απλώς δεν το κατάλαβα!
„Moteris su automobiliu, akiniais ir ginklu“ yra 1966 metų psichologinis trileris, kuris šiandien turbūt labai nenudžiugins, nes nėra stiprus savaime, bet turint omenyje tai, kad jis parašytas tuomet, kai „Dingusios“ manijos dar nebuvo, vis tiek maloniai nustebina tas, rodos, šiuolaikinis žaidimas skaitytoju.
Kaip trileriui, siužetas buvo nuobodokas, niekaip negalėjau suprasti pagrindinės veikėjos – kad ji kažkiek pamišusi aišku nuo pat pirmojo puslapio, bet šiaip jos veiksmų paaiškinimas – labai fragmentiškas ir neįtikinantis.
Kažkiek nustebino, kažkiek nuvylė, bet kadangi knygą pasirinkau iš esmės dėl viršelio, tai daug nesitikėjau ir pasiilsėjimui nuo rimtesnių knygų buvo pats tas.
3.5 stars
Such an expertly crafted book. I don’t normally read murder mysteries or noir thrillers, but this was excellent. Very intelligent and gripping. I recommend this one if you can find it.
Enjoyed this a lot. The gradual build up is very gripping as the premise is slowly laid out and things get more nightmarish. The resolution could never really live up to the set up, and doesn't, but it's still a great thriller.
Written in the 60's and therefore representative of it's time.
So don't read this if you are easily offended by the 'misogyny' of the era (yes men did hit women and yes women hit them back....Burton and Taylor did it on umpteen occasions was it right?
was it right to have kids working in cotton mills in 1800's Lancashire?
I rest my case.....)I loved this, and thought it would adapt very well to film; black and white;subtitles;'spoken' internal dialogue.Story takes place over two days and is a dark psychological thriller.
Highly recommended to fans of 1960's thrillers.
I read this book because it was on Ken Follet's of favorite books. It is old school noir. Not like The Thin Man with witty dialogue, but more like James Cain or Jim Thompson. The main character Dany is in a situation where she is not sure if she is coming unhinged or being conned. No spoilers so you will have to read it to find out who put the body in the trunk.
A classic that I read in college, I just reread it. It is one of those books that haunted me--and was a revelation at the time. It still stands up pretty well, but knowing the ending takes away from the suspense. If you haven't read it, you're in for a treat! I notice Amazon lists it new for $45, but you can get used copies in various shape for the price of shipping.
I must've read this book in the early 1970s -- sought it out after I read in one of Simone de Beauvoir's autobiographies that she and Sarte really liked it, and figured a murder mystery good enough for them was good enough for me! I've recommended it to others since, and nobody's been disappointed.
I thought I'd figured out was going on, but I was pretty much totally wrong. I love this guy: makes me want to read "A very long engagement" again. So clever, and so human.
Se van agregando algún ladronzuelo seductor y otros personajes poco memorables que enrarecen más las perspectivas de qué es real y no para la muchacha.
El personaje de Dany está construido a partir de su pobre capacidad para relacionarse socialmente, aunque en muchos momentos esto le juega en contra a Japrisot que la convierte en una muñequita tonta y torpe al borde de quebrarse, que esto no sea así salva a la novela del bochorno.
An exceptionally smart mystery thriller with a fabulous title! Jean-Baptiste Rossi, aka Sebastian Japrisot, has fashioned a true mystery.The central character is on a mission she knows nothing about. She's a blond but not dumb. She IS a little off the rails and the plot seems to be but isn't. She's on a mission in southern France in a stolen Thunderbird. She wears glasses that disguise her vision problems but those are nothing compared to her flying blind in this excellent thriller. Shades of Memento but better.
Watched the recent movie version and then read the Japrisot's book. Imagine it wasn't easy to translate into a movie, but the book has much more power. The book provides the context one needs while keeping mystery and suspense. Anita and her husband are developed characters in the book. The whole story line about the relationship between Anita and Dany and Dany and Mama Supe also enriches the plot. The marriage of Danny and arrest of Caravaille were a let down at the end of the story.
I saw the movie first and I liked it very much. So I bought a book - and it's even better)
Sebastian Japrisot is an anagram of the author's name. This is a quick read. Don't start it too late in the day. You will want to finish it before you set it down.
I was so happy when I've known for a fact I was right all along about what had really happened! Well written :)
très bonne lecture, difficile à poser.
Интересно но я думала будет более запутанно
Gotta go for movies in French, can't grasp too many of things. Ce n'est pas facile.
A noir-type novel. Strange ending.
Un bel "suspense", come lo definisce con felice espressione d'antan la nota di copertina. Ben scritto, affine stilisticamente alla corrente del nouveau roman ma senza derive eccessivamente criptiche, preciso, acuto, spiazzante nella costruzione dell'intreccio e "cool" nell'ambientazione, a partire dalla thunderbird-feticcio. Un po' prolisso e macchinoso nel disvelamento a ritroso del meccanismo.Dany Longo, la ragazza parigina che non aveva mai visto il mare, rimarrà a lungo con il lettore anche una volta finito il libro."Chiari i miei capelli, scuri i miei occhi, nera la mia anima, fredda la canna del mio fucile."
The book was interesting and entertaining - a mystery: is The Lady insane or what is going on? I gave it a low rating because the last chapter and denouement seemed rushed and out of pace with the rest of the book - as if the author ran out of time on a deadline. Further, I don't think there were enough clues in the book to help the reader try to solve the mystery. However, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed at my age.
Japrisot hanteerde een enorm moderne taal die atypisch was voor zijn tijd.Dit boek is een (psychologische) thriller die heel actueel aanvoelt (het lijkt me dat ene Gillian Flynn veel van deze schrijver geleerd heeft), maar tegelijk bol staat van verwijzingen naar de typische Franse populaire cultuur en sociale verhoudingen van de jaren '60.
Door die complexiteit hard de "onthulling" wel wat voeten in de aarde, waardoor het sluitstuk een lange en soms verwarrende passage werd.Al bij al is Dame in auto met bril en geweer een origineel en bij momenten geniaal mysterie, waarvan ik heel erg genoten heb.
So to try and remember where she's been or where she's going is a lot harder than saying, "I went from the Empire State Building and then to Upper Manhattan, before quickly grabbing a subway and catching a flight from JFK." Second, the plot is a friggin hot mess!
The last fifty pages I was just reading words without any longer trying to understand what exactly was happening or figuring out how it could happen.
The positives come from the complexity of the plot, which Japrisot must have written backwards, figuring the end and then going back and filling in details to the beginning.
One of my favorite mystery novels.A young lady decides, on a pure whim, to take her boss's car on a joyride to the Mediterranean (the action takes place in France during Bastille Day celebrations).
Nothing is taken from her but her wrist is broken.
When she complains to the manager of the station he tells her, bewildered, that she was at this same station at seven in the morning and that her wrist was already broken then.Thus Sebastien Japrisot (he also wrote "A very long engagement") takes us on a brilliantly deceptive carousel ride.His characters are all deeply flawed and deeply believable.
