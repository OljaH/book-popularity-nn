(B+) 78% | GoodNotes: A pleasant break from its romance focused precursors, it successfully plants the seeds for a satisfying mystery reveal.
I myself, did a face palm, when I read about your lipstick matching your red earrings and your red socks with your black work pants.
Questionable fashion aside, I still really enjoy this character.
She had some tough times this book, what with having no sexual escapades (the first time ever, although it seems like every male in the town is interested in her--must be the red socks), getting shot, and having part of her house burn down.
Alcide, a character I liked in past books, is kind of a jerk here and the whole head of the pack competition grossed me out.
A decent read. But Ms Stackhouse's attraction to every available guy (and vice-versa) made me eye roll and I kept saying to myself,"not again and wait what about Bill, Eric, Alcide and Sam and on and on." :/
*** 3.55 *** "...‚ÄúFiction just makes it all more interesting. Truth is so boring.‚Äù..." This one was entertaining and much less angsty than the previous couple, which of course is a good thing üòã. Sookie is still single and several different guys have been showing some romantic interest in her, but it seems that all of them come with a ton of complications attached. On top of her money problems, the bar where she works being riddled with incidents of violence, and her brother becoming a panther sh
Somehow, not very clear neither to Sookie nor to the reader, she has become a person of some influence in the paranormal community and that position comes with all the usual strings - perks and dangerous pitfalls.
"Eric," I said, "we had sex in every position I could imagine, and some I couldn‚Äôt.
It makes me roll my eyes as well as laugh, so yes, I am definitely going to continue with the series and see where Sookie will end up üòÅ.Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!
2 Enough-Already Stars Sookie Stackhouse is a:  (If that‚Äôs not clear, it‚Äôs a soup magnet‚Ä¶..
No matter what magical cookie perfume she‚Äôs wearing, I don‚Äôt buy it and moreover it seems like a very flimsy excuse to have all the hot guys in these books pant after her like dogs (at least one of them LITERALLY).
I don‚Äôt want to kill things I don‚Äôt understand, even if they scare me‚Ä¶.
I want to understand them.
Well now, don‚Äôt get all maudlin on us now, Sookie.
I refuse to believe that all of society swarms around feeling indebted to people, sure that aspect exists but that‚Äôs not all that humanity is.
Another fun read, but I‚Äôm not feeling as passionate about Sookie & Co. after this installment.
In the beginning of the book, Calvin Norris and Sam Merlotte were non-fatally shot and another female shifter, whose name I‚Äôve already forgotten, was shot and killed in the parking lot of a Sonic.
Because if I was able to consistently guess them over and over, I might get bored and not want to read these books and that would be a bummer.
Lastly, I can‚Äôt end a Sookie Stackhouse review without pointing out the inconsistency du jour of this book: on an early page, Claudine the fairy is referred to as Claudine several times.
I enjoyed the story, once again, but I was disappointed by one thing, which has sort of been bothering me since the 1st book in the series.
It seems to me that at times Charlaine Harris isn't able to keep her details straight.
In my opinion, Harris has created a world of detail in these books, and it seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the story when those details change from book to book in the series.I wish that Sookie would stop being so friggin' unreasonable when it comes to disagreements.
Eric is back to being his old arrogant self, Bill is sulking around with a realtor, Alcide is freaked out Sookie killed his ex and blames her for his father's death and Sam is incapacitated from being shot (although they did share a heated moment in his office that Bill interrupted) While Sookie did meet the alluring Quinn (who I am sure will show up in future books) no major love interests have popped in.
Still better than book two's very weak story, but not as thrilling as the other novels.It will be interesting to see were things go with this.
We still get a quiet a bit of Erik but just in a different way, sigh this makes me sad because I want Erik all day every day.
I think my favorite part of the whole book is‚Ä¶ Ok wait well 2 things I liked best, One when she meets Quinn and the connection they have.
It‚Äôs instant and powerful.And 2 Erik said Alcide tends to use Sookie but never tells her until she is in the thick of it and that is soo very true.
I love how cocky Erik is and now sweet yet sinful Sookie is.
Ok on to book 6!!
But you know, all women in our society have to deal with entitled men all the time‚Äîthe neighbour who wants to carry your groceries so he can see the inside of your house, the guy who ‚Äúhelps‚Äù you with your suitcase so you feel obligated to go for coffee with him, the guy who is paid to paint your bathroom (and you suspect that he wants to be alone to go through your underwear drawer), the friend‚Äôs husband who thinks it‚Äôs okay to make a suggestive comment.

Dnf~29%This book was on my TR shelf since forever. I loved the first one and kinda liked the other 3 books, but this is too boring. I really don't care what happens to Jason, I never liked him anyway. I'm not interested in his story-line.Maybe it's the fact that I've watched "True blood", which I liked very much (all those hot guys :D), but I can't make myself continue this series. There are many much more interesting books out there.
Pero que manera de terminar el libro es est√°, dej√°ndonos con la miel en los labios? Jajaja... Na' habr√° que ir a por el sexto...:)
"Eric," I said, "we had sex in every position I could imagine, and some I couldn't.
You told me it was the best you'd ever had...too bad you can't remember it."Eric looked like I'd hit him in the forehead with a mallet..."Is there anything else I should know?""You offered to give up your position as sheriff and come to live with me.
huh?But, as I said, Eric is not hugely present in this book.
"Eric, do you know what Sookie is telling me?
Someone shot her.""Don't get so emotional, Pam," I said.
So, Sookie doesn't actually have sex with anyone in this book.
I think I'm a little disappointed.
This was a reread, and I've read this series all out of order, and enjoy them, while forgetting them entirely in between reads.
But when I came into this one, and realized at the end that Sookie isn't actually with anyone in this book, I was a little...confounded.

You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook
Considering the fact that I‚Äôm a 90s baby that is completely OBSESSED with all things 80s I dig Sookies fashion sense üëçAgain as a huge true blood fan I‚Äôm going to love this book anyhow, to which I do.
Fangtasia's new bartender is a Pirate; The Shreveport wolves are about to have a new Packmaster; A sniper is targeting shifters and most importantly....Not one...Not two...Not three...Not even four...You wish it was five but no...SIX, yes, SIX males are after Sookie's affections.What's a waitress to do?Fun and fast read as always.The mystery was well executed, even though a bit predictable.
There was more world building through the ceremony that would decide the new Packmaster, and a new character who'll probably be sticking around is introduced.
First Bill, now Alcide, I hope the same doesn't happen to Eric.Speaking of Eric, I wish there was more of him in this book.
I remembered my New Year's Eve resolution: I wanted not to get beaten up  I mean,is it a Sookie Stackhouse book if Sookie doesn't get hurt?how the fuck is this bitch still alive?Anyways,i loved it.i know shocking.so much shit happened.once again we didn't have to deal with Bill's boring ass üëå,Jason is living his werepanther life,the werewolf ceremony was fucking weird 10/10 and Tara is still a dumbass.like honey nooo.she is useless.can't even have a sugar daddy.we also have a psycho trying to d

I cottoned onto the Southern Vampire Series because I saw the "True Blood" ad campaign by HBO.
Basically, I was led to this series which features a telepathic heroine by the name of Sookie Stackhouse.
I find Sookie's struggle to deal with these attentions endearing.It would have been so easy for the author, Charlaine Harris, to add a serious subtext to this series with the emergence of Vampires into human society and their struggle to mainstream as a metaphor for racism and the battle for civil rights.
Just wondering.) It's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a story like this.
My adventures with the Sookie Stackhouse Series began with the show.
Just the fact that they can shift seems to be enough of a reason for this shooter to try to take them out.Every male in the entire world wants Sookie Stackhouse, in case you hadnt caught onto that yet.
She‚Äôs got a werewolf, two vampires, a were-panther leader, a fairy or two.
When you pick books like these up you kind of have to accept that it isn‚Äôt life-changing literature.
And in typical Sookie fashion, she‚Äôs the last to find this out.This is another exciting installment in the series.
Any author who pens a heroine who matches her socks to her lippy and earrings, is bound to also write obscenely ridiculous ‚Äúman‚Äù fantasies, a la the Sookie Stackhouse Series.
I thought I had found that someone in Eric, but I can‚Äôt help but judge him for his continued interest in Sookie, or grow tired of Sookie for her inept ponderings on both life and love.I suppose Harris is a good mystery writer, I only guessed one of the bad guys, but her books are becoming extremely over the top, just like an 80‚Äôs movie.
Well in case you can't tell, I'm hooked on this series.
It's so much more than the HBO True Blood series.
This series keeps taking the Sookie character in new directions but all of them seem to be logical extensions of where she's come from.
Yes, it's a wonderfully written series that keeps me looking forward to the next book in the series.
This is a great series to have outside by a warm fire, your favorite beverage and a cigar.
The shadows hold extra meaning as you read the books.
Yes, so far Ms. Harris has my devoted attention to her well written series!

Dead as a Doornail4 StarsIn the aftermath of the witch war, Sookie Stackhouse only wants to live a quiet life.
Alcide's true nature is also revealed via the Alpha contest sub-plot.
Whereas the sexy Were truly appeared to care for Sookie in previous books, the darker of his nature is revealed as he attempts to use and manipulate Sookie for his own selfish needs.Calvin Norris, the were-panther leader, does not fare much better.
It is clear that he wants Sookie as little more than a brood-mare and is not above using Jason as leverage.
I like how the vampires are on the sidelines in the story.
Sure Bill, Charles and Eric are present but it's not about them.
Charles has the most lines in this book and even there, I don't feel like he's that much present.
With the story revolving around Sookie and who shot the shape shifters, I got to learn a bit more about other supernatural beings like the ritual for werewolf leadership.
And of course, everyone proclaims their love to Sookie.
Everyone wants a piece of Sookie.
Everyone wants her now that she's been discovered!
This is a book I've read a couple times in the past and realized I never actually wrote a review for it. From what I remember, this one focused on the shifters more and less on the vampires, so right there, that gets a lower rating from me. :PWhen I read these books, esp. if I'm re-reading, I just skim for the Eric Northman parts. There is always what I think of as lots of filler and I rarely get into the side plots. I don't remember too many specifics from this honestly, so this will be a basic review.
Thank you, 1952!But I think if one looks deeper into the story (assuming this is even possible), the entire series can be viewed as an allegory for women's liberation.
In book 1 Sookie starts out as a piece of eye candy.
But as Sookie comes in contact with more and more supernatural beings she no longer views her telepathy as a "disability" but is instead begins to use it.
This is similar to women discovering that their sexuality is not a curse and beginning to use it to their advantage (i.e. take control of it instead of letting it control them).
There's no rest for Sookie as her life is targeted several times, but thank god for her fairy godmother...There was less of a structured plot in this one and more of many little plots, some of which connect and some of which don't - but I found it more enjoyable than some of the more single-plotted books like Club Dead.
A whole parade of men tramp through Sookie's life wanting her attention and more: Eric, Bill, Sam, Alcide, Calvin and the new guy, Quinn.
This one had the most plot lines of any of the books, which I'm not sure I liked as much, but it was still quite enjoyable!It's probably my least favorite of the series so far.
Worse and worse. Yet another Stackhouse ‚Äúmystery‚Äù principally made up of Sookie flirting with every man of her acquaintance in turn, doing her hair, painting her nails, choosing her various hideous outfits and unnecessarily judging people she barely knows for the flimsiest and most vacuous of reasons, e.g : ‚ÄúHis companion‚Äôs face might have been sculpted from marble. Had the woman never heard of a tanning bed?‚Äù . Presumably in Sookie‚Äôs world the only skin tones acceptable are dead or orange. The
Sookie is once again sexually harassed by a potential new love interest, various characters we don‚Äôt really know end up dead, and the next book in this relentlessly poor series is clumsily set-up.
Obviously in Bon Temps it doesn‚Äôt do for a woman to flaunt the dress code unless she doesn‚Äôt mind some pretty unpleasant assumptions being made about her.Vainest Self-Description / Worst Synonym for ‚ÄúBreasts‚Äù‚ÄúI knew he was taking in my jeans, which were on the tight side, and my tummy,which was on the flat side, and my soft fuzzy white sweater, which was filled with natural bounty.‚ÄùMost Repetitive Use of TelepathySookie stops a drunk causing trouble by reading his mind and discovering that the most effective weapon to use against him is his fear of upsetting his mother.
