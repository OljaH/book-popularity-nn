My Intense And Passionate LOVES:‚Ä¢ Harry + Ginny = yes.
Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.‚Ä¢ Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy.
I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it.
‚Ä¢ I also particularly liked Harry in this book.
Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well.
I don't even care what the "reason" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape.
Like how is that good??
i dont want to talk to anyonedont even look at mei was expecting it and i still cried for like 30 minutes
(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: It dwells on the delightfully mundane aspects of the magical world, and adds new dimensions to familiar characters.
This remains one of my top favorite HP books! The Voldemort origins, the Dumbledore/Harry business, Draco's mission, the Snape reveal, and the moment the trio decide to not return to Hogwarts so they can stop Voldemort once and for all. It's a book that manages to balance so much darkness with light, so evident too in the last line. #AdamRereadsHP
She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions.
Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone.
The Half-Blood prince was considerably darker than the previous 5 books, and I just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have.
Obviously I knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before, but it didn't take away from the experience the novel had to offer.
I have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one, but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series.
Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouThis is DEFINITELY one of my top favorite books in the series.
I don't know what it is, I just feel like a proud mom.-ALL OF THE TOM RIDDLE BACKSTORY.
I literally need a whole book about Tom Riddle's life.
(Harry is always going on about how great the Prince is and how terrible Snape is, etc.) I loved it!-"Tom used to collect trophies," said Dumbledore, "This will be important later." WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST EXPLAINED HORCRUXES TO HARRY THEN?
I‚Äôm yet to mention one of the most important characters in this series in a review. I‚Äôm, of course, talking about Severus Snape.Severus, the unsung hero.Severus, who sacrificed his own soul.Severus, who loved another more than life itself.Severus, the half-blood prince- the truth about his character was, and will likely always be, one of the most surprising twists I‚Äôve ever read in fiction. The set up is all in this book.
Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless.
But with the new book coming out in a couple of days, I have to go through them beginning to end.
To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats.
I could revisit this world over and over!! Mel üñ§üêæüê∫
A strong and fierce woman and wife, as she was herself.)-the Memories: Dumbledore at the orphanage, Tom Riddle visiting Hepzibah Smith and Voldemort coming to ask for the DADA teaching job.-"The Other Minister" is one highly interesting and funny chapter.-Dumbledore's visit at the Dursley's-Utter silence before Hermione accidently punches herself with a telescope.-Ginny finally getting more spotlight, being the sassy and talented witch she is-Hermione pretending to go out with Cormac just to make Ron mad-"I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won," said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past, smirking.-Ron's love potion episode-Harry unknowingly discovering you-know-what while hiding his Potions books in the Room of Requierement.-Professor Trelawney actually predicting the right stuff just to dismiss it as rubbish-"This is Mr Dumberton- sorry, Dunderbore.
Especially not after Dumbledore's Army.In a nutshell: I love Harry Potter.
It seems like by now, everyone would realize they should listen to Harry..Such a sad end :( I knew that was going to happen before starting the series, but didn't know when. It still got me in the feels, though.The book as a whole was really fun and entertaining. I love the mystery and learning more about Voldemort. The romance drama was funny as well.I can't wait to see what adventures the next book brings and how it all concludes..
Actual rating: 4.25 starsThis review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionWhy did Professor Snape stand in the middle of the road?So you‚Äôll never know which side he‚Äôs on!!
Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing she‚Äôs not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book.
Bleh.Harry and Ginny I‚Äôm totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING.
If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren‚Äôt here nearly enough.
And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I‚Äôm really going to miss this series.
Buddyread with the cutest Trixi.*sniffs* I have actually finished this several days ago but I spent those days mourning for the loss of one of my favorite characters of all time and before I start bawling my heart and eyes out again, let me straight away proceed to the random thoughts while and after reading the book.
Thanks Grampy Sloghorn and Harry has never performed better.
Why do you keep looking for Ginny, now Harry?12.
(view spoiler)[ I ship Harry and Ginny!
I knew there was a reason Harry spent so much time with Professor Dumbledore.

Edit : Rounded it up into 5 stars!REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW!4,8 Stars  'Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,' said Hermione. 'I heard him telling your mum, Ron.'  I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than
That time I wanted to hurt Ron's heart too, I wanted him to feel the exact pain Hermione felt when she saw him kissing Lavender.
I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then.
And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore.
Always been my favorite out of the seven.
In which case, have you been living under a rock?!(view spoiler)["Do not pity the dead, Harry.
And I like weird.
I like how he says he sees a new pair of socks in the Mirror of Erised.
I like how he believes Harry unconditionally, no matter how farfetched his story may seem.
He‚Äôs been a guide, a counselor, a friend, not only to Harry, but to everyone Albus cared about.
He‚Äôs been a shoulder, a rock, some form of hope to everyone who had the privilege to be a part of his life.
Everyone looked up to him.
Yet he never looks dangerous.

‚ÄúIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.‚Äù  Reading this book was brutally depessing. I've never expected Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be dark like this, but I liked it anyway. The boy from book one has grown up and makes a decision that turns out to be disastrous. The thing I loved about this book might be when Harry and Dumbledore dig into Voldemort's memory. We get to know about him and what kind of person he was before he became the Dark Lor

The thing I loved about this book might be when Harry and Dumbledore dig into Voldemort's memory.
The development of these characters is surprisingly good too.
Harry and Hermione are perfect together, but not in the romantic way.
J.K. Rowling did a good job when she started writing this book, she knew how to unify the pieces scattering around these six books.
Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress?
Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times.
(hide spoiler)]Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler)[Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series.
P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. There were some things I truly loved about this one. I loved how the bulk of the book, nothing crazy happened. It felt like some of the older books and I love that feeling. All the Harry and Dumbledore time we got, the memories of Voldemort‚Äôs past (which were very interesting) and of course Harry and Ginny, who I‚Äôve shipped for a while now finally got their shot. That‚Äôs the good. There is also a lot of sadness and despair. A very important and influential

I almost want to wait a while to do the final book, but I really want to finish these books by the end of 2016 so I better start it straight away.

The way she writes is just so easy to read and always makes me feel super "comfortable" in the world she created.
And what a wonderful world that is!
He is one of my top fictional characters ever created, and to see him playing such a huge role made me incredibly happy.(view spoiler)[There is just one little thing I've got to complain about: Harry's and Ginny's devoloping relationship.
For a while I was even wondering if Ginny slipped some Love Potion into one of his drinks...Ron and Hermione on the other hand...üíñ (hide spoiler)]
Not my favorite from the series but still one of the best books out there.
You knew it was coming, but it still hurt.Anyone familiar with the hero cycle knows that the protagonist will usually lose his mentor figure.
As this was the penultimate book, I think many of us knew going into it that Dumbledore would die before the end.As this book is mainly about Harry spending time with Dumbledore, it was bittersweet.
I would like to think that Albus saw Harry as a sort of adopted grandson.Albus knew his time was coming and set his affairs in order.

three or fourthree or fourthree or four i have no idea but i do know that j.k.rowling should be banned from writing from this day forward. STOP. HURTING. MY. FAVS.RTC3.5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i just have two things to say1) why are these books so HUGE ???? halp2) i'm convinced this is gonna be the best from the series so, much pressure TAKE THAT, PRAG
I don‚Äôt usually write reviews like this where I talk less about how good the book is but more about what goes on in the plot*****Also this was a re-read for me**This book was so much better than I expected.
I laughed a lot more than usual when I read Harry Potter books.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this series and I do like Harry but he is so stupid.I enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny.
I feel like reading this book made me love the series more and I‚Äôm not sure if that was even possible.
