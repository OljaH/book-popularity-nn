This book deconstruct the reality(unreality?) of the salaried middle classes of Berlin in early nine
yeah, this guy's name is pronounced almost like 'crackwhore.' he wrote about the white collar masses. this is what they did and why they liked to do it, on the eve of national socialism. for a long time - some seventy years - you couldn't read this in english. then everyone demanded that this crackwhore be translated, and so he was. you should rejoice that this crackwhore is accessible to you, too, unless you already understood turgid german. what I mean to say is that it's quite good.
really wise, thoughtful little book on white-collar worker mentality... still relevant today, though historically interesting, and applicable to a wide range of cultures - so much so that it makes one wonder how much industrialization has generalized cultural internationally. stylistically a bit dry at times, but definitely worth the read and reread.
Confirmation bias is too kind a word for the set of assumptions, baggage and ideology Kracauer brings to the task.
Weitz, who seemed puzzled by how...for lack of a better word...mean Herr Kracauer appears when begrudging these salariat their meager pleasures, especially the female workers.
Kracauer was mostly a charlatan, but due to the political machinations of academia and the proliferation of "studies" degrees, especially the interdisciplinary racket, "The Salaried Masses" and several other Kracauer works are likely to remain in print for awhile longer.
You couldn't do much worse than Kracauer, unless you're grading grad students.
Itâ€™s like David graebers bs jobs but written by a Frankfurt school writer in 1930
Important subject matter, significant in economic and social thought, but that doesn't make it any more interesting to me.
Very actual despite the elapsed time (1930 versus 2016)
