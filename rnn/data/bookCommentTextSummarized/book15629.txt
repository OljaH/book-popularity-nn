In "Killing Floor" (which I thoroughly enjoyed), Lee Child introduced an electric main character named Jack Reacher.
In Reacher, Child has created a character who can interact with anyone, go anywhere and do anything.
She picks up Reacher as a hitchhiker and tells him a sad story about her life.
Unfortunately, all anyone in this book seems to do is to debate whether Carmen is telling the truth.
They do very predictable redneck things, are racists, shoot rifles, and like everyone else in the book, debate about whether Carmen is telling the truth.
Maybe she isn't.What does Reacher, the super-smart, ultraviolent action hero do throughout the book?
Despite the fact that the story moved at a very fast pace, I still felt like I couldn't turn the pages quick enough because I was dying to know who was behind these murders.Jack Reacher never ceases to amaze me with his cleverness and confidence, which are certain qualities I admire in men.
In this book, (view spoiler)[he had to investigate the death of two men in an attempt to save the woman from serving a life sentence for a murder she didn’t commit, and he had to find this woman’s daughter before time ran out (hide spoiler)].On the whole, this was a captivating suspense-thriller with complex characters, brilliant plot twists, and riveting action scenes.
Getting into trouble literally out of the blue, Reacher finds himself caught up in domestic abuse / kidnapping / murder mystery with roots in Southern elitist racism.Hells Bells this is good fun!
While his opponents are all about dirty deeds done dirt cheap our man is thunderstruck when a Texas flood (SRV cover) gets everyone wet and makes things more than a little interesting.Child stays in the shallow end of the pool and keeps the action rolling and is a live wire when it comes to spinning some Holmesesque outlandish connections.
It’s Reacher, he was an Army MP and knows how to figure things out.
;)The Jack continues to be a fun read and Child knows that moneytalks.
“Pantser” was--and may well still be--a term used in the publishing industry to describe authors who do not plot, who “write by the seat of their pants.” And while you can’t always tell if a particular writer is a pantser, there are certain books and series where there is absolutely no doubt that the authors write as they go.
Or Lawrence Block, a pantser in regards to the majority of his work, who for most of his long career was able to think so far ahead that there was no need for filler; only in recent years, as he has slowed down (he was once able to produce twenty pages a day), has the meandering become noticeable.
Child lets the reader into Reacher's head.
Far from it.While the reader does have great access to character motivation, Child generally only allows us to see a single side, a single dimension.
And, just when you think you have something figured out, Child reigns you back in, and forces you to re-engage your mind by tossing in a curve.
Her six-year old daughter will lose her mommy, and she will lose her life, unless Reacher can prevent Sloop from exacting his revenge.As with every Child novel I've read, and I'm almost done with all of them, nothing is as it appears.
I have given 3 positive reviews in a row here...pretty good.This book has what I'd call an "interesting" opening...
If you've read many of my reviews you know I use that word, frequently.
It says so much.Reacher upon smacking someone (else) in the nose makes the disturbing discovery that he seems to have damaged the person of the local constabulary.
Realizing that discretion is the better part of valor (and that he could possibly disappear into a local jail and no one anywhere would be the wiser) he makes the decision to move on and see "another" part of the country.He's picked up by...are you ready...an interesting woman.
Actually a surprisingly good read...my opinion of course.Enjoy.
Now I suppose the question is, after 5 novels am I already falling out of love with Jack Reacher (now don't get me wrong he's not really my type 😳 , but I have enjoyed his larger than life (literally) character).
Well hopefully the answer is no.
I did enjoy this book and would give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I cannot round it up to 4, its not as good as episodes 1 to 4, so 3 stars it has to be, sorry Jack.Maybe it is time for another "Jack free" break.
Another good story by Mr. Child. 5,388 ratings, 356 reviews, 3.90 stars probably says it all. I did like Micheal Busby’s review which I have linked below.http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...
6/10With a newborn child just arrived and your nights reading time ruined, what book will see you through those 5 minute windows you get when you're not drooling in a sleep coma, cleaning up baby shit or vomit.
A constant back and forth pretty much throughout the novel didn't make for a very interesting read.
Whilst not the best in the series (by a long shot) it was pretty much the ideal read for me at the time, I could pick it up and read 5 minutes and drop it at a moments notice and not feel robbed.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oops I must of fell asleep with my hand on the keys.
This book was so boring that I can't keep my eyes open.
Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and I enjoy all of the Reacher novels but this one sucked.
I couldn't wait for this one to end so I could move on with my life.
The beginning and the half way through it had a good story line and I was really looking forward to something good happening, back nothing ever came.
The end was very predictable and boring.
Not one of his better books.
I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Jack Reacher is in Texas after breaking up with Jodie in New York, back to living like a bum in cheap motels, carrying only a toothbrush and cash (but no ID), walking and hitchhiking everywhere, and throwing away clothes rather than wash them.
Later the next morning at the cheap flea-bitten motel, he sees 4 big bubba cops go into office and he leaves through the back window, looking for a ride as a hitchhiker.
It is Jack Reacher on tranquilizers.
Let me start out by saying I love Jack Reacher, but this is the weakest of all Lee's books, IMO.
It was the usual, Jack going to go out of his way to help someone and I didn't have issues with that.
The way law enforcement works in Texas should have been better researched as well as Mapquest could have been used in order to gain distances between El Paso and Ft. Worth and therefore given truer timing information.
Being a Texan and from Texas it mattered to me.
I have read all of Lee's other books and enjoyed them tremendously, just not this one.
Note: my Reacher ratings are on a different scale from all other ratings I allocate. They range from 3 stars to 5, in the context of the Reacher universe. This one, a 4-star Reacher novel is not as good as a 5-star Reacher novel, better than the rare 3-stars which are lame for Child, and pretty good for his universe of competitors. Because I can.
Reacher meets a new character, talks to her for about 10 minutes, describes a situation, and then she gives him the keys to her car so he can drive off to keep the plot moving forward.
this 6' 5" drifter -- hey, watch my kid, ok?It doesn't detract from the storyline, and if you're reading on a beach or something, you won't care ...
So if you're reading his books, don't look too closely, it's beautiful as long as it's left blurry.
This one had a very personally relatable setting in that it’s in hot as fuck Texas.
Now we don’t have much humidity here in Arizona, but I definitely know hot as fuck (it was 115F the other day.) Good pacing, good mysteries, and some of the most intense action sequences I’ve seen from Child yet, especially the climactic confrontation.
(view spoiler)[The shootout on the “clock” mesa was pure fucking awesome.
I did like that Child kinda played with gender roles by having the big tough guy getting taken out early and easy while the smaller woman proved to be the biggest, meanest and smartest threat.
(hide spoiler)]
Number 5 in the Reacher series.I am slowly working my way through the Reacher series and this is, in my opinion, is the best so far.This book takes place in Texas.
Add the brooding presence of Jack Reacher and the arid landscape soon becomes a lot more animated.Part of the books premise is about how down trodden the Hispanic populous is.
The husband ends up shot to death and the finger of suspicion points at Carmen, the Hispanic wife.Unfortunately, for the family, Carmen, has convinced Jack to help out.
There is a lot of quantum leaping by Jack who seems to guess exactly what's going on with no real evidence to back it up.
I read a review for this recently where the reader was disappointed that there wasn't very much action in this book.
While listening to this one I kept thinking about that review and in this book, much of the so-called action is analytical and subtle.
I sort of had it easier than most that i had previously listened to this book so I knew ahead of time, things that would happen-although not in high detail.
By the end of the book the reader is able to realize how Reacher came to the conclusions that he did.
nešto lošiji Reacher od prethodnih no svejedno progutan u rekordnom roku što i je ono bitno.ogromni, slabo naseljeni Teksas kao pozornica uzrokom je malog broja likova i statičnosti u romanu pa zato i sitnija ocjenajaka trojka i preporuka
That bitch Carmen and her approach with Reacher.
The way she keeps pushing Reacher.
She keeps pushing about the beating she'll have to suffer, wanting Reacher to take care of her problem for her.
Only, none of them know what they're taking on with Reacher and he certainly has his fun poking away.I did love how Reacher backed good ol' Bobby down.
Child did a good job of confusing me every which way and I am so looking forward to Reacher's next adventure, 
She loves her six-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Mary Ellen, and she has plans for Reacher.
Very enjoyable tough guy story. I wanted to keep reading. It’s fun. You need to suspend disbelief a little.STORY BRIEF:Carmen is of Mexican heritage. Her husband Sloop is white. They live with his mother and brother on a remote Texas ranch. The mother and brother despise her because she is Hispanic. Her husband frequently beats her. They have a six-year-old daughter Ellie. Carmen has no money or family she can turn to. Sloop has been in jail for 1  years and will be coming home in two days. Reac
She wants him to kill her husband, but Reacher refuses, saying he is not an assassin.
Reacher makes many suggestions, but for each one she says “I can’t” or “I won’t.” I found her illogical, unreasonable, and unwilling to help herself.
However, for much of the book, there is a question of whether Carmen is telling the truth.BACK TO THE STORY – REVIEWER’S OPINION:The best parts are the handful of incidents where Reacher hurts bad guys.
I loved the way Reacher threatened Sloop, the wife beating husband.
(I’ve run into this a few times in my own life.) Did the author want Reacher this way?
While interesting in parts, this book felt flat to me.
The question of whether Carmen was telling the truth or not intrigued me, but in the end I found her and all the other characters unlikable, and not in an interesting way.
I enjoyed seeing Jack be a noble humanitarian (the scene where he retrieves $20,000 is especially satisfying) but I found it unconvincing that he kept sticking around with Carmen, despite her shaky stories.
The shoot-out at the end was exciting, but Jack's long monologous explanation afterwards felt forced.
After finishing this book, I wasn't jonesing to get my hands on the next Jack Reacher, but I'll get there in due time.
My Rating: 4.1/5Just like all the other novels, this one is great too. The phasing of the story is better than Tripwire and the characters are interesting enough. The book is good edge of the seat type of a one. But you can easily find out the bad guy and the final twists yourself. It's really predictable but who cares?the story is good and it's a fine novel. I will read the next one. Than you.
The Jack Reacher novels are guilty pleasure reads for me, due to my complex relationship with Lee Child.On the one hand, I love his work.
Either way, I continue on with the Jack Reacher stories because I want to see where they head… yet at the same time, they are not books I can sit and mass read.
During this time, I will read stories filled with lyrical prose, causing my fangirl of a brain to explode at the beauty, before I return for the action of Jack Reacher.All in all, my mixed feelings towards this book are to be expected.I’ll start with my biggest annoyance: the repetition.
Lee Child is the best at what he does. And, if you're ever in trouble, and Jack Reacher comes along offering to help, don't say no. In this story, Child skillfully introduces the pieces but doesn't tie them together for a long, delightfully suspenseful time. There is lots of action, and a 6 year old girl who pulls at your heartstrings. Is it all plausible? Of course not. But it is a great read.
The 5th book in the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.Jack Reacher is an ex military cop who is never far from trouble. If your only experience of Jack Reacher is the poor film with Tom Cruise, don't be put off. This series of books are fast paced and have plenty of action.

This is his best book so far! I enjoyed it so much. He made me feel the nightmare heat of Texas and I also enjoyed the rain. Lee Child can write about rain storms better than anyone and I love rain. It helped that I have visited Fort Stockton. I will read this one again in a few years.
My Thoughts: I know what to expect when I pick up a Reacher novel - action, girls and plenty of cheese.
Reacher believes a complete stranger based entirely on his gut instinct and then most of what she says turns out to be lies.
It is disappointing that Reacher's personna was nearly destroyed in this one and I hope that 'Without Fail' picks it up a bit.Theme: 2/5 A little bit lacking in this one, mainly because it seemed so forced.Plot: 2/5 Again, not as fresh and exciting as some of Reacher's previous adventures, but it did keep the pages turning.Characters: 3/5 Jack Reacher is awesome.
Their little girl, Ellie, herself a brave smart soul, is the slim tie that binds, but almost immediately Carmen winds up being a punching bag for Sloop.
From there, a complicated plot ensues, made even more complex by a two-man, one-woman team of assassins who first kill some "watchers" (who we thought might be after the little girl themselves), followed in quick succession by the murder of Sloop, ostensibly at the hands of Carmen.
Meanwhile, the marvelously suspenseful plot keeps us turning those pages quickly, something we've seen in all the Reacher stories.
As usual with my reviews, please first read the publisher’s blurb/summary of the book.
Some references are made, but nothing to seriously affect the plot, characters or pacing of the book.Sadly, the first 1/3 of the book is uneven, with parts over-detailed, repetitive and uneven.
The element of racism is quite repulsive, and perhaps a bit overwritten.However, the last 2/3 of the book is mostly superb.
Fantastic pacing, good prose, smooth plot and action.
Most of the clues have been given to you throughout the book, kudos Mr. Child.Then the final section to find the missing person, is a bit repetitive and far too drawn-out.
