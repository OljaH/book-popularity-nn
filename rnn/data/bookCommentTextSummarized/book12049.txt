I'm actually not entirely sure how many volumes of this I read the first time around but I'm pretty sure it wasn't all seven.
Spike brings his trademark manic eye to bear on his own experiences as a gunner in World War II and, while some of the events are tragic (obviously) you still barely get a chance to breathe between laughs.Yes, it's irreverent, yes, it's disrespectful, but laughing in the face of tragedy is how we Brits keep from going insane.
Which is actually rather revealing because if modern British comedy and humor writers have a spiritual grandfather, it's Spike Milligan.
Although he was also a talented musician, he became known for his mad cap and often surreal comedy writing, particularly his work on the Goon Show.Before all that, he went to war, and before he went to war, he had to be trained.
From the bizarre officer's dances Spike's band played at to the crazy antics they got up to when learning to work the radios--he was a radio operator--it's funny in a slightly crazed way.
Milligan actually suffered from bi-polar disorder all his life, and this whole book reads like an extended and very funny up period.
دیروز صبح شروع کردم به خوندنش و امروز بعدازظهر تموم شد.
خب البته برای یه کتاب 200 صفحهای رکورد محسوب نمیشه، ولی به هر حال جذابیتش رو تا حدی نشون میده.
وقتی کتاب تموم شد، من داشتم گریه میکردم.
کتاب پر از تکههای خندهدار بود که یک جاهایی باعث میشد بلند بلند بخندم، پایان تلخی هم نداشت، ولی فقط یک جمله، یک جمله کافی بود که موقع تموم شدن کتاب، آدم زار زار گریه کنه: «اونها داشتن به سمت مرگ خودشون میرفتن.» به سمت مرگ خودشون میرفتن و کلی ماجراهای خندهدار میساختن که یه نویسنده ماهر میتونه ازش یه کتاب خوب

ولی اشک آدم درمیاد که این آدما، اینهمه خاطرات خنده‌دار، اینهمه روزهای خوب و بد که بعد از 60-70 سال، نه فقط خودشون که به لطف ادبیات ما هم باهاشون زندگی کردیم، به سمت مرگ می‌رفتن، جنگی که جز تباهی و ویرانی دستاورد دیگه‌ای نداشت.
Brilliant!I was shown a picture of Adolf Hitler and was told ,this is your enemy. I searched every compartment of the train but I couldn't find him anywhere. If this isn't enough to rope you in then I don't know what is. It piqued my curiosity immediately. A brilliant take of life during wartime. Having to enlist when most people probably didn't want to. He has included fictional characters throughout, just as well! The humour remains the same. Typically Milligan to the end.😂
Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall, is the first of Spike Milligan's seven memoirs that recount his recollections of life in the army during World War 2.
That said, Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall ends just as Spike's regiment arrives in Algiers for its first taste of action and, whilst there is some tragedy in this memoir, things will inevitably get more serious from here on in.
Spike's silliness is infectious and the book contains a winning combination of word play, self deprecating humour and social history.
This book takes us from the outbreak of war through to the beginning of 1943 when Milligan arrives in Algiers.
Everything is taken with humour and Milligan is full of wonderfully bad puns – when he finds that, during a romantic tryst in a lorry, somebody drives off with them on board, he returns to his friends who ask where he disappeared to, replying, “I got carried away...”I am amazed it took me so long to get around to reading Spike Milligan’s war memoirs, but I am truly glad that there are many more books to read.
Bought this book on a limb when I saw the title.
So that sealed the deal.I really enjoyed this book from the vivid descriptions of war practices to the humorous practical jokes, talkbacks and commentary.
As a lover of music, the talk of Milligan forming a band, playing gigs and their love for jazz made me unbearably happy.
The fact there was a gun fight in a club and Milligan was the only one still playing; just one of the many funny anecdotes in this story.
Favourite quotes:- "It's a great feeling playing Jazz.
Most certainly it never started a war."- "Happiness is a yesterday thing."This short book is well worth the read.
He wrote seven short books about the experience based on his diaries, here's the first one which concerns joining the army, training, starting a jazz band during training, more training, exploits/hijinks/affairs, and finally getting shipped off to Northern Africa, where the book ends.Roughly every third sentence is a joke, and most are good - sometimes, randomly, the horrors and insanity of his situation creeps in for a paragraph where he describes (without joking) how a fellow soldier died in an accident, or how decades later he visited the same place and cannot deal with the ghosts ('What’s happened to us all since then?
A funny book loaded with witticism and occasional slapstick humour. Although some jokes/anecdotes mentioned are too bawdy for my taste but those are still funny anyway. The internal hierarchy/working system of army as well as the technical terms described in the book may be a little esoteric for laymen. But overall a very interesting and worth-reading memoir.
There are so many hilarious anecdotes and great characters along the way, but it's Milligan's wit that makes even the most mundane moments come alive.I can't quote here, I don't want to ruin any of the book's great lines (trust me, there are many).
You can see how his humor has come down through the years of British comedy, especially in Douglas Adams' writing.
There are times when this reads like a missing novel from Mr. Adams...This is a can't miss book, essential for fans of Brit comedy and recommended for all that would like a crazy and occasionally bawdy laugh.(NOTE: I'm from the USA and borrowed the book from an Irishman.
Based on the way this account of Spike Milligan's time in the British military during World War II reads, you'll wonder afterward how in the heck the Allies ever won the thing. From details about the horrendous ineptitude of the officers and men alike, to the comedic antics of the men in and around the defense of Great Britain, Milligan's novel (which was made into a movie), is listed on Amazon.com's list of all-time best humor books.It is a quick read and will raise a few dry smiles, but it is not one to go out of your way for.
It has been so long since I laughed out aloud reading a book.
Spike Milligan is hilarious.
I kept my daughter awake for nights on end - we shared a bed while her dad was away.
She asked me to read out what I was reading but didn't quite "get it".
I loved his one-liners, his suggestion to a friend that they form a band.
When his friend points out there are only two of them his solution, "We'll sit a long way apart!" Just loved it.
I must read more of his works now.
From BBC radio 4 Extra:A new gunner is recruited for the Second World War.Spike Milligan shares memories of his wartime service.Published in 1971, Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall is the first volume of the Spike Milligan's idiosyncratic military memoir.Reversioned into 8 parts by BBC Radio 4 Extra.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g...
aAAATENSHun!Right you 'orrible lot read this it's funny right. This here book is about Spike an' iz war years, got that! You will piss yerself larfin'. Go on! Read it, yew will lov' it.
Yes, that is what some of this book, the first in the series of wartime memoirs by celebrated British comedian Spike Milligan (who was, coincidentally, the inspiration for Monty Python in the first place with his group act 'The Goon Show'), would feel like: hilarious, anarchic, almost brutally sarcastic, bawdy and guaranteed to leave you in splits.
But it is hard to be tickled to death when, at the same time, Milligan is also gunning for biting, bitter satirical commentary on the state of the war itself and how it came home to rattle the whole of Britain .There are vividly nightmarish scenes of nerve-wracking despair meshed ingeniously in between the more rib-tickling sequences; there is also a heightened sense of the irreparable damage that destruction and death leave on mere mortals, not least of all the hapless troops marching to war themselves.
This is a very funny book.
The humor is pithy and nearly constant, but there's a good look into what was happening in Britain in the early days of World War II, which is entirely different from the picture most of us have of the US during the same period, since beyond Pearl Harbor, none of us had to worry about the major enemy forces attacking us personally every day.
I'm hoping to start the next book in the series soon.
Frigging hilarious. You'd think based on most of the admissions it's a work of fiction. Not sure what to believe and what to not, but looking forward to reading the other six volumes in the "trilogy" in the new year.
2 reads 20 years apart.
And while at times I enjoyed that style, and had to laugh because of what I read, at other points it came across a little forces.
Like the book had to be funny so jokes/funny lines/puns where place in the text when ever possible.
While reading I would sometimes wonder "what does that have to do with what you just mentioned?" The book has a tone of photo's and drawings which are a nice addition to the text, and fit well with the way the book is written.
An autobiography of Spike Milligan's time in the English army in World War II.His writings are humorous and sometimes serious anecdotes of his time served in the war.
The anecdotes progress from his time in Eastbourne/Hailsham and end when he'd arrived in Algiers.
I was interested in this book because of the Milligan name, though I didn't know initially that this was an autobiography.
There are some hilarious passages but others are dull; the anecdotes are arranged almost haphazardly in a loose order by event, so the progression of the book is a bit clunky.
The book is an interesting format one might expect from the Goon, mixing narrative anecdotes, photographs, excerpts from diaries, letters, and plenty of doodles and sketches.
It is a very funny read, but the words from the preface are worth reproducing:"There were the deaths of some of my friends, and therefore, no matter how funny I tried to make this book, that will always be at the back of my mind: but, were they alive today, they would have been the first to join in the laughter, and that laughter was, I'm sure, the key to victory."As such, this is at once an entertaining and enlightening read.
Well worth chasing down…
This is the first (and best) book of Spike Milligans war memoirs. It is part unofficial regimental history of the Royal Artillery and part a joyous and affectionate recounting of the characters and events of Milligans war years.I can't say I'm a great fan of Milligan humour but I love this book, which I have read over and over...it is a very witty book written for maximum comic effect (which it achieves) but avoiding parody.My only hesitation in recommending the book is that I do wonder whether this is a very English sort of humour.
Danger of fractured ribs through severe laughter!First read this book many many years ago. Since then I've done 25 years in the army myself and can recall every tale and character Spike so vividly, accurately and humorously recounts. This is a book written with pure squaddy wit I'm so glad that I rediscovered it. Sadly there are few Milligans left in the forces today. A real unputdownable gem.
I read it to bits and the more I read it the more I appreciated that Spike has given a fair picture, surreal as it is, of what life was like for young men like him and his bombadier mates who suddenly found themselves in the army. Lots of quotable bits, but I advise you to read it yourself.The Goon Show was the joy of my childhood. I wrote Spike a fan letter and he replied - apparently he always did reply, personally.
I was expecting this to be a zany, hilarious pseudo-history. It turns out that it is a sincere memoir (the first of seven) of Spike Milligan's service in World War II, albeit written in a funny way. He paints a vivid picture of army life, more "colorful," and presumably authentic, than contemporary war movies. My favorite aspect of the book was a recurring reference to the treacly "Warsaw Concerto."
I read this book many years ago as a teenager - and it's still as brilliantly funny now as it was then. And even better than that, I now realise that it has immense value as a historical document too - it gives a very vivid impression of what it was actually like to be serving in the british army during the second world war. And did i mention it was funny.. well it is!
Spike Milligan obviously has an irreverent style, it makes this a very unusual war memoir, but I not a great one in my opinion. If you are a fan of Spike you’ll enjoy it, if you’re not particularly into him, this will be a bit tedious.
Good old goony Spike. Without this man, would we have made it to the broad sunlit uplands?His assault on the fuhrer begins in the family home when war is declared and marches on through the exploits of military training, into North Africa. Who needs A.J.P. Taylor!
Hilarious book. I gave myself a stitch in the side sometimes. But my enjoyment was tainted by some racist undertones in the narrative . I was disappointed to discover that Milligan was actually well known to be a racist. But an enjoyable read nonetheless.
Lots of funny stuff - even a few laugh-out-loud situations, but all in all it reminds me a bit too much of "Beetle Bailey" and left me with a general feeling of "you should have been there to get the joke"
