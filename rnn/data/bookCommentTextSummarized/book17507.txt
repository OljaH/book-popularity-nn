I’m trying to stop being a hater but it’s just so hard.......when there are so many things………….that actively need my hate.
but with tails.*me, smacking two pans together* look, it is 2017, put queer people and people of color in your FUCKING BOOKS.
Let the record show that she was not actively trying to find said map during her fake kindapping for the most part of this book.
Alosa tells him his brother also attempted a sexual assault on her, and his reaction is to be relieved.
It should not be this difficult to stay prisoner on a pirate ship. This is the second time I’ve had to stage my own capture. Ridiculous. 3 1/2 stars. This was a whole lot of fun for the most part! My few complaints are not really huge issues, but more "this could have been a lot better if..." However, it was a decent debut and I'll be looking out for the next in the series (quick warning: the title of the sequel is kind of a spoiler for part of this book).Daughter of the Pirate King has a rathe
My few complaints are not really huge issues, but more "this could have been a lot better if..." However, it was a decent debut and I'll be looking out for the next in the series (quick warning: the title of the sequel is kind of a spoiler for part of this book).Daughter of the Pirate King has a rather self-explanatory title.
I laughed out loud several times because she's almost TOO good; she has to make it seem like she's a reluctant prisoner by attempting to escape, but she is so good at escaping that she must also stage her own capture again.
I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did, and while the plot is completely different, it gave me that same dreamy feel I found when I first read Caraval last August.The front cover boasts how Alosa is "a female Jack Sparrow", and I would emphatically agree with that statement, aside from the fact she is always sober and much more cunningly brilliant than he.
This was a book that's enjoyment isn't contingent on the ability to surprise you; even if you are able to guess each and every plot point before it comes, the adventure, witty dialogue, and budding romance between Riden and Alosa are enough to make this a 5 star read on it's own.
This was in my March Owlcrate, I'm a bit late reading it.
The pirate captain, Princess Alosa, was bad to the bone and I loved it!
Alosa was taken by another pirate and his crew.
Captain Draxen and his brother Riden thought they got lucky by capturing the pirate king's daughter.
******SOME SPOILERS******Alosa was sent to this ship by her own father, to be taken as a prisoner.
I loved the banter between Alosa and Riden.
His brother, Draxen was a jerk though.
They get into it with some other jerks and we find out revelations!
I loved the revelation!

4.5 stars! Oh boy. Daughter of the Pirate King fulfills all promises and more. This is definitely one of my best reads in 2017.   "I value brilliant minds, honest souls, and those with long endurance. I forge relationships based on trust and mutual respect, not fear and control."  Update: 27.10.17I will admit I love a sassy character, and Alosa could definitely give Celaena Sardothien a run for her money when it comes to wits and brutality. I wont say shes exactly like Captain Jack Sparrows (bec
She also lets her main character make mistakes that are not too obvious, which I absolutely love!There were even some twists I didn´t see coming, and it´s been a while since last time I was surprised by a book (I blame Sarah J Maas for her excellent foreshadowing that I sadly miss more often than I´d like to admit- so now I always try to pick up every detail).
The only reasons I´m not giving this 5 stars is because I missed some world building (which I guess is due to most of the story taking place on a ship), because I felt like some parts of the end were a little rushed and also because their age bothered me a lot in the beginning.
3.5 stars.Pirates are definitely not popular in YA literature.But they should be!
Also practically extinct in real life, which makes them all the more fascinating in books.Alosa is not just any pirate.
But more than that, she has a certain special ability that makes her almost unbeatable.She’s on a mission for her father.
It’s like it’s parodying its own story.
Alosa is so sure of herself, so skilled and so cunning that you feel her high amount of confidence in every sentence.
I personally think the romance is too prominent.
AmazingAmazingAmazing! I absolutely loved this book from start to finish. I love the protagonist and her personality. The story is not particularly fast but it is very captivating and makes you want to keep delving deeper into this world. I love the whole pirates concept and reading from the perspective of the daughter of the pirate king adds to the whole effect. The book starts off with our protagonist disguised as a man and her ship is currently being attacked. She surrenders and is captured
The book starts off with our protagonist disguised as a man and her ship is currently being attacked.
A group of the mostly female badass pirates, how can you not love them!When we start the book we know little apart from the fact that she is the daughter of the pirate king and getting to know more about her past, however little, was very interesting.I look forward to learning more about these characters and how they move forward in this story of pirates and intrigue.
Ahoy, mates!Have you re-watched The Pirates of the Caribbean so many times you know every scene by heart?Have you ever wished you could wield a sword and battle sea-beasts, explore bright blue oceans and listen to the song of sirens? Are you fascinated by hidden treasures and pirate rivalries? And, most importantly, do you like your books uplifting, of the put-a-huge-grin-on-your-face variety?If you answered yes at least once, then lo and behold! You just found your new obsession!  “Oh, the ridi
In order to retrieve an ancient map leading to the world's greatest treasure, hidden in the domain of the sirens, Alosa, the Daughter of the Pirate King, has to allow herself to be captured by her enemies and spend her days being interrogated, so that she can search their ship at night, seeking the piece of the map they possess.
Tricia Levenseller, though, works her own kind of magic; you set sail with a bunch of pirates (the vile and the cunning, the superstitious and the kindhearted) and dive into swordfights and treasure hunts, you are enchanted by sirens and fall in love with Riden and bow to Alosa's brilliant mind and her precious snarky attitude, and you savour the fun side of reading.
The synopsis sounded like something I would love AND THERE WAS ALSO SLOW BURN ROMANCE AND ENEMY TO LOVER TROPE.My best friend : slow burn romance and enemy to lover?
sounds interesting.Me : yeah, wait till you hear what I think and you probably want to stay away from this book.
Yeah, the main character and her love interest argued and bickered but I honestly don't know when they began developing feelings for each other but then the romance happened and I was so freaking confused, like " what the hell is going on?" and then the romance also lacked that romance spark and heat when it happened.
And therefore our roster of activities looked a lot more like this: complimenting self, gazing lustily, telling not showing, thinking about the abstract concept of coming up with a plan but deciding not to, cutting scenes right when they get interesting, complimenting self more, and more, and more.I.Hate.Alosa.She single-handedly took what could have been a fun romp across the seven seas (except not seven seas, because this is a fantasy world supposedly, although we have nO WORLD BUILDING TO SHOW FOR IT) and made it into what it is.
Story ⭐⭐⭐⭐When I was younger I was totally crazy about the movies „Pirates of the Caribbean“. First of all: Orlando Bloom. I totally had a thing for him. Second: Captain Jack Sparrow aka Johnny Depp aka the coolest Pirate in the world. This book is like a book version of pirates of the Caribbean with a female badass Captain Jack Sparrow called Arosa who is also the daughter of the pirate king. I was addicted from the start. Mostly because I loved the main character and her sassy personality. Cha
This book is like a book version of pirates of the Caribbean with a female badass Captain Jack Sparrow called Arosa who is also the daughter of the pirate king.
Mostly because I loved the main character and her sassy personality.
Characters ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Like I said: I love the main character Alosa.
I mean, yes some things Riden did were not so great, but in the end we are not in the normal world.
He wasn’t a total ass like some other man in this story, he was kind of nice actually and he always knew that Alosa could get herself out of problems herself.
But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.Debut author Tricia Levenseller blends action, adventure, romance, and a little bit of magic into a thrilling YA pirate tale.What I Liked:This was a really fun and entertaining read - exactly what I would hope for, from a story with pirates.
"All in all, I'd say he's a cocky bastard." 2.5 stars. Ok most of my friends loved this book, but for some reason I was mostly irritated the whole way through. I loved the idea of the book... there's really not much that could disappoint me about female pirates + a cocky first mate. But I wasn't that into Alosa's narration. I didn't need to hear quite so much about her entire thought process for everything and found the tone to be super young (even though the almost-parody aspect of it was fun)

But I wasn't that into Alosa's narration.
And the romance had potential but started WAY too early to be even remotely interesting.But the basic idea of princesses + pirates is still awesome.
I think those who are looking for younger-sounding YA books might enjoy this more than I did!
This was such a kickass, action packed and fun story about PIRATES and a super badass FEMALE PIRATE!!!! This book is not perfect and has so so many flaws which kind of bothered me (mainly the writing) but, it was just. so. fun! Review to come.-----The main character reminds me of Merida from Brave and on top of that she's a badass pirate??? My two favorite things????? Wow, I'm pumped.
So I ended up just reading getting the ePUB, but man I adore this book so much I might buy a hard copy despite my dislike for the cover.
This book is a fast-paced, fun, action-packed pirate adventure, filled with manipulation, cunning, thievery, romance, humor and a great helping of wit.
There plenty of fun twists to keep to guessing, and while this book does end on a high note, there is certainly more mischief and trials to be had.
To sum this up simply, hats off to the author because this book is everything I love about pirates 
When she killed those men without flinching I was like DANG GIRL.
Ha-ha, now in real life please realize I would not react this way if I saw a murder taking place - but because this was a book character, I loved it.Another huge plus in this was Riden and his ability to understand Alosa.
I found it all entertaining, and in the end things did become more difficult - or should I say, realistic?Another huge negative was the ending.
Besides that, it was really entertaining and I almost want to say that I loved it because of it's wittiness and ample amounts of humor.
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest came out that year and fueled the fire to my obsession.So back to this book, I loved the premise.
The one thing I didn’t like was that I wanted more of her female pirate crew and her ship.
Random side note: I loved that the endpapers were a map of the ship she was on.
I always love maps in books so that was a nice touch.Overall, this was a fast paced and exciting pirate adventure story that features a female lead who slays (both literally and figuratively).
Daughter of the Pirate King is what I wanted from that book.
It's more fun, the banter between the main character and the romantic interest was well done, and it was just generally more to my style of preference.Alosa is the daughter of the pirate king.
I really liked how specifically Alosa said she valued good qualities in her crew, and how they supported and encouraged each other.
A lot of times when authors DO choose to try and have diverse roles, they get attacked for not "doing it right." Readers also have the right to not read books if they don't want to.
After DNF-ing a shitty pirate book last month I was hesitant to read this. But I was pleasantly surprised. I finished it all in one sitting because it was super fun and fast paced. I really liked the main character and how she was always one step ahead of everyone. And her banter with another pirate was A+!
This was an extremely fun read. I loved Alosa! So fierce, sarcastic and intelligent. Loved the slow burning romance. Loved the action and twists.
4.5/5 starsFor some reason reading this now I got so much more out of it?
Bought to start it now :)______________________________________________February 16,20174.25/5 starsVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obmwL...This was so much fun!
I LOVE books that feature pirates and I found this to be just what I needed.
Our main character was amazing, I loved her spunk.
Although I am super busy I still found time to read this book because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
Can't wait for the sequel!**Was sent this book in exchange for an honest review**
“Oh, the ridiculous things one has to do when one is a pirate.” I've read this book twice now and I know I'll be reading it again. It's the perfect book for when you are in a slump - it's light, funny and PIRATES!!!I read this book again this month, as it was picked as a group read in my Facebook Group TBR and Beyond (you're welcome to join!). I was really excited about reading it again, because I wanted to be ready for that sequel that is coming later this month. Was the reread as good as I r
She runs her own ship (almost completely of women pirates - love it!), she's incredibly dangergous and she is full of sass.
There is also more to Alosa, she has a bit of a secret - another power but I will let you read the book and discover it for yourself because it's pretty damn cool.
There are also a couple of twists and turns in this book that I didn't see coming and I always love that.
I highly recommend this book - most people I know that have read it had a great time.
but there was a hint of another potential suitor though can't tell what kind of person he is just yet, other than he works for her father) -and sometimes triangles are fun, admit it!, plenty of fight scenes, and a cast of characters that are sure to grow over the series (Riden's relationship with Alosa and his brother, the other evil pirate guy who escaped, Alosa's father/mother, Alosa's shipmates, etc).Sooo glad I have this one in hardcover and just from the author's easy writing style (snarky, first-person, fast-paced), I know I'm going to love her future works and she's now on my autobuy list.
If you look at the Daughter of the Pirate King under originality lens, you probably won't find anything really original about it: we have a sassy kick-ass heroine, a swoon-worthy hero, funny banters, and, of course, adventures.
Without the pirate theme this book would probably be like any other cliched YA story, hence the funny one!
Now, I didn't mind that a lot, but maybe I wished the story would concentrate more on pirate adventures than characters' romantic rendezvous.
*4.5 BADASS STARS* "Everyone has something dark in their past. I suppose it's our job to overcome it. And if we can’t overcome it, then all we can do is make the most of it."  I've always had a weak spot for pirates. It's my kryptonite.

*4.5 BADASS STARS*
It all started a few years ago when I discovered captain Jack Sparrow (who doesn't love him?!) and this book I used to read on Wattpad called A Pirates Kiss.
This book now comes third on my list of favorite pirate-related stories!Since I've been sick the past couple of days and love pirates so much, and had some time on my hands, it's no surprise that I managed to complete this in just a few hours of time.
Also, like everyone probably knows by now, I'm a sucker for badass and strong female characters.
3.75 starsVery entertaining.//The synopsis sounds pretty badass. Also, I've never read a book about pirates so I'm excited to jump on this one :)
WrensReads Review:Pirates are an all time favorite for me.
And a book about a pirate princess is like the "holy grail" for me.
I do want to state one thing: There is a difference between cocky and confident, and this pirate princess was very, very cocky herself.
I wasn't a fan of that whole side of the plot.All in all, like a lot of my reviewer friends have stated, it was a little young-sounding, but I did enjoy it and I will read the next book when it comes out.
Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/WARNING: THAR BE SPOILAGE I’ve come to the conclusion that there are two types of grown women in the world. Those who love Disney and all of its princesses and then there’s me . . . .  I don’t understand how the other half thinks and they probably feel the same about me. That being said, I requested this from the library after seeing it being equated to “a female version of Jack Sparrow” which had me immediately going . . . .  If I had
If I had known I was getting a Disney princess story I wouldn’t have wasted my time.
Especially if I had known it was going to remind me of the most vapid of them all .
Buuuuuuuuut you don’t find that out until you’re a goodly chunk into the story because we’re too busy finding out this crap is going to be a kissing book which had me all like .
Why don’t you female authors get on board and stop writing stupid bimbos and instead write some stabby ones.
This one was like taking twelve steps back.
I believe we create ourselves to be what we want.”   I really liked Alosa's character- she was fun, sarcastic, witty and badass, all the attributes a female lead should have.
And if we can’t overcome it, then all we can do is make the most of it.”    - but the romance scenes were- Wow.But honestly, aboard the pirate ship- I think the romance could've been toned down a bit.The beginning of this book plus the blurb are badass, definitely intriguing.Overall I liked this book, the writing was well-written, the plot was awesome and it was fast paced I can't wait for the next :)P.S I have to endure my pain of my ship being not perfectly canon yet *sobs*  update  I forgot to mention.
honestly, i love any and all stories about pirates (if you have any recs hmu!!!) and this one was so good!
love me some good tension between two characters who are annoyed with each other, but they also tease each other and djdgjdgDJFGJFi keep debating whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars because, while it's a new favourite, i didn't really click with the writing and it's what bothered me the most about this book.
