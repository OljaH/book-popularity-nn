Hard to put this point more pointedly than when she says, “Ultimately, having an experience becomes identical with taking a photograph of it, and participating in public event comes more and more to be equivalent to looking at it in photographed form.” Page 18 And breathtakingly, "It is common for people to insist about their experience of a violent event in which they were caught up—a plane crash, a shoot-out, a terrorist bombing—that 'it seemed like a movie.'” Page 126Photography gets to be ‘evidence’ because, “In the fairy tale of photography the magic box insures varacity and banishes error, compensates for inexperience and rewards innocence.” Page 41 The problem is that not only can photographs lie – something we still struggle to believe – but they lie on every level.
I'm giving it four stars not for the content itself, but for the quality of thinking I did while reading.
Less shocking but also disappointing: her wholesale dismissal of the Surrealists, or as she calls them two or three times, the Surrealist "militants", which they decidedly were not.
Overall, I found the writing -- while at times illuminating -- overwhelmingly and groundlessly judgmental.
Sontag's logic is often very, very dubious; she is as dangerous as Camus (I'm thinking of Le mythe de Sisyphe) when it comes to the seductiveness of fine, well-articulated prose which uses its own music to trick the reader into believing the message.
Sontag drops epigram after epigram, aphorism after aphorism, in these contentious essays, as she speeds through considering the subjects of photography's most famous practitioners, be it the rural towns of Roy Stryker or the "freaks" of Diane Arbus.
Despite the essays' fast pace, the work as a whole lacks anything approaching a coherent direction or central thesis.
Far from wanting to develop a cogent argument, Sontag so often seems most concerned with provoking thought and daring her readers to challenge her assertions.
Unsympathetic readers likely will find Sontag to be imperious, but those willing to engage with her thought will find themselves rewarded.
While it's a good paragraph from a literary perspective - cameras become guns, people are possessed by celluloid voodoo, and taking their photos is just a slightly better way of murdering them - it's the kind of writing that George Orwell famously described as being designed to "give an appearance of solidity to pure wind".All these essays have been written in the 1970's, long before the advent of both the internet and digital photography - which has transformed the medium completely, as it's now surrounding us completely, included in everything that we do.

Step one: buy this book. Step two: find a writing utensil Step three: go on the subway/metro/pvta and go!you will want to underline just about every sentence because it is life changing. You will want to hug your camera and then throw it into a fire. You will never approach the world the same again. Get ready. Just do it. And then go read Regarding the Pain of Others, because it will be like playing Candyland.
A quality present in all the essays as she entertains many aspects of photography for the benefit of the reader.Sontag looks at photography from the perspective of the photo, the photographer and the viewer.
Arbus's photographs - with their acceptance of the appalling - suggest a naivete which is both coy and sinister, for it is based on distance, on privilege, on a feeling that the viewer is asked to look at is really other.
Her statements on Arbus' photography and subjects are about how Arbus transcends the limited ideas of beauty, to produce a work that accepted another world.
A dense and theoretical book on a subject I know very little about. She refers to a vast collection of exhibits, and all I knew before is 'point a camera at a thing and press a button'.Sontag is very forceful and eloquent in her opinions. I can see her turning Plato's idea of forms and representation right on its head, but the question of 'stealing' life or emotion by photography is a more puzzling one. Would it be possible to 'steal' others experiences and suffering in writing?
A wonderful essay on the art of photography.
Susan Sontag starts her book on photography with a reference to Plato's cave, a dark prison only a few escape.
Sontag does not spell this out very clearly, but her analysis points to a failure on the part of photography to make itself an instrument of politics and history.
Here's where Sontag's Platonism kicks in; photography fails because it cannot bring about a political moment of truth that disperses the fantasies of the cave and forces the cave prisoners out into the open where they will be confronted by reality.
In the age that we are in now, we seek in photographs not things "as they are" but rather ourselves as we could be - an angle or version of ourselves that exceeds our own appraisals and what we deem commensurate with reality.
Like Dorian Gray's portrait, the series of photos we present to the world represent our best selves, which are impervious to age and destruction - the time and corrosion which we bear to preserve their beauty.
On hold. While fascinating, 'every sentence contains a thought' is not as fun as it sounds.
Można więc powiedzie, że Sontag podchodzi do analizy problemu zdjęć bardziej jak do malarstwa, choć wyraźnie wskazuje w jednym z esejów, że między tymi dwoma sztukami może być więcej różnic niż podobieństw, jeśli się na nie pojrzy z odpowiedniej strony.
Za pomocą zdjęć staramy się nie tylko utrwalić dany moment naszego życia, ale przede wszystkim go sobie przywłaszczyć, podkreślając aż zanadto jak kruche i ulotne są chwile.
Może nie nosimy już ze sobą aparatów, lustrzanek czy kompaktów, bo wszystko, co potrzebne do wykonywania zdjęć mamy w telefonach.
O tym wszystkim Sontag pisze w swoich esejach i aż dziw bierze, jak wiele można z nich współcześnie wyciągnąć.
This is a classic book of essays about how photography reveals so much about society, politics, history, and our attitudes towards preserving the image and the potential "truth" inherent in a photograph. I don't read much nonfiction, and this was originally for a class, but there isn't a single person I wouldn't recommend this to.
Q: Why is this book called "On Photography"?
Given that not one word of this book says sustains a single positive sentiment about cameras and their usage, why wouldn't it be called "Against Photography," or maybe "Photography is the Downfall of Human Kind."This is not at all the book I thought it was.
Given its most quoted statement, "To collect photographs is to collect the world," I expected a somewhat romantic vision of the photographic craft.
Out of focus.
Susan Sontag's incredible, penetrating critique of photography doesn't just cast into doubt the value of the activity of taking a photograph, but it posits some of the irrevocable changes that the advent of this technology has had on our world and how we experience it.
Anyone who reads this having previously nurtured an interest in photography at any level should experience a degree of nausea while reading.
But at the same time, Sontag is genius enough to avoid condemning photography.
I only wish she were still around to answer some of them now as we are fulling in the digital age of photography, where the concept of reproducibility has given way to something even more radical.
حول الفوتوغراف كنت قد قرأت كتاب سوزان سونتاغ (الالتفات إلى ألم الآخرين)، والذي تناول الصور الملتقطة والتي تمثل آلام الآخرين، في الحروب خاصة، جمال ذلكم الكتاب جعلني أعود لقراءة كتابها الأقدم (حول الفوتوغراف) والذي تناول التصوير بشكل عام، محاولاً تحليل تحولاته ومدى تأثيريته على الإنسانية، من خلال مصورين مختلفين كانت لهم مشاريع تصويرية متعددة. الكتاب جميل ولكنه يحتاج إلى نفس قرائي عالٍ
The first 2-3 essays of the book are just astonishing.
The later essays tend to sound polemical, in the negative sense of that word, rather than exploratory.
This, for me, is the key difference between someone like Sontag and someone like Didion, to whom comparisons - at least I've noticed this lately - are often drawn.
Point being, Sontag can sometimes irk me because her sexy essayistic writing begins to feel claustrophobic; I feel as if I've been seduced into agreeing necessarily with points that aren't as fully developed as they could be.
In the later essays of this book, Sontag writes her readers into a corner.
Questioning the nature of photography--its purpose, meaning, future--Sontag forces us to consider revolutionary ideas about the simple act of "snapping" up the world.
Similarly, photography becomes a creator of revised memory in families that, under the surface, experience great dysfunction, pain, and disconnectedness.There are thousands of other gems in this genius book, and I can not recommend Sontag's meditation enough for photographers or anyone else disturbed by the prevalence of image in our society, what it means (when we really look at it), and the future of our psychology.
This is the worst book I've read about photography.
It isn't even about photography, it is about Susan Sontag consistently misunderstanding photographs.
It isn't intellectual, either.
It is her emotional responses to the shallowest possible reading of photographs.
The defining moment is in the appendix of quotations, the only good part of the book.
The first quote is from the notebooks of William Henry Fox Talbot, one of the earliest photographers.
He wrote, "Make picture of kaleidoscope." This idea of photography as painting with light is utterly outside the simplistic readings of photography in Sontag's book.Don't waste your time.
There is probably no subject that cannot be beautified; moreover, there is no way to suppress the tendency inherent in all photographs to accord value to their subjects.
But the meaning of value itself can be altered "---" Through photographs we follow in the most intimate, troubling way the reality of how people age.
Photographs show people being so irrefutably there and at a specific age in their lives; group together people and things which a moment later have already disbanded, changed, continued along the course of their independent destinies.

هذا ما أحبّه في التصوير الفوتوغرافي ، الجميع متساوون ، القبيح يتحوّل بقدرة قادر إلى فائق الجمال .
وهذا ما طرحته سوزان في كتابها .أنا لستُ بالفوتوغرافر ، لكنّي أستمتع جدا بالتأمل في الصور الفوتوغرافية ، الغريبة الجميلة اللي فيها فكرة ...
و إستمتعت أيضا بقراءة الكتاب ، تسرد فيه سونتاغ الصورة الفوتوغرافية ، تأثير الصورة في المجتمع ، و قد ايش ماتغيّر في حيوات ناس ، ناهيك عن تجارب المصورين المختلفين في التصوير الفوتغرافي ، تتحدث عن الصورة من الكاميرا إلى تعليقها على الحائط ، تنهيها بإقتباسات قيلت في هذا الفن الجميل ، أعتقد أن كل فوتوغرافر عليه أن يقرأ الكتاب .

The book was very philosophical in places and made me look at photography in a completely different way.
Best bits in the book were:•	Karl Marx attacked philosophy for only trying to understand the world without trying to change it.
And it needs to gather unlimited amounts of information, the better to exploit natural resources, increase productivity, keep order, make war, and give jobs to bureaucrats.
The production of images also furnishes a ruling ideology.
The narrowing of free political choice to free economic consumption requires the unlimited production and consumption of images.”
I first read the article from which this book was born when I was doing my MFA (2000), picked up the book at a used book store several months ago and have been reading chapters in the midst of other reads, projects, etc.
Sontag's ideas are so culturally important and have been so assimilated into what we "already know" that it may be difficult at first glance to see how remarkable her contributions were back in the day (1977?) when she first began to articulate them...
or how relevant they continue to be.
Her "obviousness" is a testament to how influential she has been regarding the visual medium and its molding of both personal and cultural memories.
با اینکه هدف اصلیِ کتاب بررسی فلسفیِ عکاسی است، اما اطلاعات بسیاری هم در ارتباط با عکسها و عکاسهای مهم تاریخ به آدم میدهد. کتابِ بسیار لذتبخشی بود برام؛ منتها به نظرم توضیح و تفصیلش در بعضی موضاعات بیش از حد کافی بود.کتابِ اصلی و یکی از دو ترجمهٔ موجود، هیچ تصویری ندارند؛ اما من نسخهٔ انتشارات حرفه نویسنده با ترجمهٔ نگین شیدوش را خواندم که بیشتر عکسهای مطرح در مطالب را هم به کتاب اضافه کرده است.پیشنهاد میکنم اگر ترجمهٔ بدون عکس را هم میخوانید، هر عکسی که بهش اشاره شد را گوگل کنید و ببینید.

Este ensaio deixou-me com imensa pena de não haver um ensaio mais recente neste livro, por exemplo, do início dos anos 2000 (Susan Sontag morreu em 2004).A fotografia, mais recentemente, transformou-se num divertimento quase tão praticado como o sexo e a dança, o que significa que, como todas as formas de arte de massas, a fotografia não é praticada pela maioria das pessoas como arte.
As I read Sontag’s essays, I feel like I can imagine her fiercely arguing for the many ideas and questions she posits.
While I think she harshly overstates the role a photographer plays, I thought one of the most intriguing points made was about the moral passivity of photographers and a disregard for the pain and misfortune happening around them in order to get a good shot.
After reading reviews and talking to some who have read On Photography, it appears that many of its readers, whether they loved or loathed the book, had a lot to consider during and after reading.
