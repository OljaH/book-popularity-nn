This book has ruined lives.Of almost every woman who has read it.(I was coaxed into reading it by one!)They all, poor things, lead the rest of their lives believing that there was a soul mate out there for them.Fiction: The book itself, a semi auto-biographical tome with the author discovering his ‘soul mate’ (his second wife in real life – an actress whose claim to fame is a bit part in the 1969 Sci-Fi TV series - Star Trek).
Post the divorce, the author did put up a short story on his website.
This story was an allegory of his life and books that he had written.
I am coming to really admire Richard Bach's stories.
The love he and his wife find with eachother and the growth that they have is so beautiful and powerful you get caught up in it yourself.
I wish Richard and Leslie Bach the best of luck, hope, peace, and love wherever their souls happen to be (which is to say everywhere and in everyone ;-) ).
A autobiographic love story belong to one Pilot author and one movie star. At the beginning they have started to relationship as friend. Then Richard accept to alter his life style because he were thinking that if he would not be free if he has a serious relationship. He has been feeling himself a rabbit against to her who is be caught by the short hairs from hunter. Afterward they loved each other.Leslie's letter was so impressive. At the end of the book it explain that how their soul leave from their body and they met there. I liked it.
This is so far the most beautiful love story that I've ever read!
I liked the storytelling and the heartfelt words nicely written.
The plot is not corny as say Spark's A Walk to Remember or Segal's Love Story.
Love here is depicted by the long and ethereal flights taken by the lovers.
Their love soared heights and when they are up there, with the way Bach used to describe their emotions - you can feel the intensity of their feeling for each other and their union with forever (like the boundless sky)!
Put aside for the moment the fact that author Bach divorced his so-called "soulmate" (which rather kindles the wick of the dynamite tied to the support columns of this "bridge across forever").
I knew I was in trouble early on when I encountered this: "How long have I been missing you, dear soulmate, I thought, dear wise mystical lovely lady?" Some three hundred pages later, I was floundering around in "Unless one is ready in advance for the shock, sudden wealth buries one in complistiquesque multibranch crosswebulated tangleworks weight-freighted toward intricationary ponderositives." Had I read this as a lovelorn teenager, looking for life's answers, no doubt I would have eaten this up.
Oh my god, this is one of the worst books I've ever read.
I read it nearly ten years ago and my brain is still searing.
I hate it and want to kill it.
Die, you piddly New Age piece of crap.Oh you want a reason?
Whiny, egocentric, complete embodiment of the worst of older men who believe they deserve everything.
Um, yeah, that didn't happen and I hate this book.
I actually read his other books knowing they would be bad and boy howdy did they ever get worse.
But this is bad in a grandiose, bestseller at the thrift store kind of way.

“Ik pa brīdim, es rakstu, ir jauki aizvērt acis un tumsā sacīt sev pašam:”Es esmu burvis, un, kad acis atvēršu, redzēšu pasauli, kuru pats esmu radījis un par kuru vienīgi pats esmu pilnībā atbildīgs.” Tad plaksti atveras lēni kā priekškars, atklājot skatuves vidi.
Un mēs esam pārliecināti, ka tur atrodas mūsu pasaule, tieši tāda, kādu mēs to esam uzbūvējuši.” (90.lpp) Jā, bija labas nodaļas un citādi.
Nē, neiekritu grāmatas valdzinājuma varā.
Jā, grāmata lika man ieskatīties interneta dzīlēs un izlasīt Baha biogrāfiju.
Jā, esmu lasījusi grāmatu par kaiju vārdā Džonatans Livingstons.
Nē, uz doto brīdi nav nekādas vēlmes lasīt vēl kādu Baha gara darbu.
One of the worst books I've actually kept reading until I finished (although I honestly don't know how I did it).
This is probably the only one star rating you'll see from me, because there are too many good books out there to squander time on the crummy ones.
If I don't like it, and I do happen to finish (which isn't likely), fair enough, that's my opinion and I'll simply leave it out of the mix.
Corny, amorous drivel mixed with a smug author's excessive self-absorption just doesn't make for good reading.
My first 0-star rating.
I don't understand how anyone can give this book any stars.
Lesson learned - when revenge is your primary motivator, things tend to backfire.To be clear: this book is the boringest, tritest piece of superficial dreck ever.
It didn't help knowing that Bach and his "soulmate" ended up getting a divorce, but even aside from that, as a piece of literature, this book suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked.This man cannot even write.
To emphasize "I'm going to meet my soulmate today!" "Just think, today's the day I meet her!" or some such sh!t.
Uggghhh what a waste of day.

This book was a find for a quarter or some low price somewhere as a take along for a vacation months ago. I got it as Jonathan Livington Seagull has stuck with me in my mind for decades. I though why not??As it turns out I am at a point in my life where I wonder if I will be alone the rest of my life or will I find someone "special". This love story has given me hope. Right now, that is enough.Enjoy it!!!!!
Tai darau dėl daugelio priežasčių: rašymo stiliaus, banalios siužeto linijos, nuobodaus pagrindinių veikėjų vystymosi ir t.t. Jeigu knygos autorius būtų paauglys, galėčiau pateisinti visus prieš tai paminėtus knygos trūkumus, bet dabar tai yra tiesiog prastos literatūros požymiai.
Tebūnie, autoriaus teisė tuo tikėti, tačiau pasirinkti "nepaprasto grožio aktorę", kuri dar yra ir labai protinga, intelektuali, išsilavinusi, stilinga, muzikali, geraširdė ir aktyvi kovotoja už neteisybę - kaip tą vienintelę ir tikrą pagrindinio herojaus moterį, ar neprimena pigios romantinės novelės?
Vienintelis dalykas, kuris man patiko šioje knygoje, yra antroje jos dalyje piešiamas Lesli ir Ričardo bendravimas, bendras tobulėjimas, augimas individualiai ir poroje, vienas kito palaikymas ir išklausymas, abipusė pagarba ir vienas kito stūmimas į priekį.
Richard Bach's theme in the novel 'Bridge' is his search for 'soulmate' and his concept of love, and also how he find out his true soul mate.
However, this idea is one among the many ideas he discussed in the work; at the same time, the idea of 'love' dominates in the work.You can find different voices in this text; Bach who is against the institution of marriage; against the institutionalized church; against govts' intervention of individual freedom; and so on and on.
Knyga man sukėlė daugybę skirtingu ir sakyčiau net prieštaringu jausmu.
Mano dabartinė (povestuvinė) emocinė būklė turbūt neleis man visiškai objektyviai apžvelgti knygos.
Man visiškai svetimi dalykai, todėl jo mastyma ir požiūrį, jausmus teko išmokti suprasti ir prisijaukinti.
Vienintelis malonuma gadinęs dalykas buvo mano žinojimas, kad šie aprašyti santykiai realiam gyvenime nutrūko ir autorius vedė trečia karta.
Galiausiai mano amžius ir gyvenimo patirties stoka turbūt sutrukdė tam tikras knygos vietas suprasti ir įsisavinti maksimaliai, man jos pasirodė tolimos ir nepažįstamos, nesuprantamos.
Nuolatiniams gyvenimo ieškotojams, tiems kurie neranda ramybės ir klausia daugiau, nei gauna atsakymu.
Atsakymu čia buvo daugiau, nei klausimu.
As Richard jumps from seeking love to avoiding and dances around his long running on-again off-again relationship you can't help but say to yourself at times, "Man, that's exactly how I felt." Bach's semi-autobiographical character of "Richard" doesn't come off well.
The criticism of this book is typical that Bach is a one dimensional author and "Bridge" is simply "Jonathon Livingston Seagull" if replaced learning about flight with learning how to love and the bird with a human who is kind of a jackass.
Don't read it as a philosphy book like "JLS" or "Illusions" (another favorite of mine), but for the honesty in which Bach puts emotions on the page.
This book gives a perfect insider view on men's fear of commitment issues.
I'm afraid it's not a positive nor comforting view...
It was amazing how the marriage part was mentioned so casually sice it came as a natural step, not as a peak of the story...
Marriage was merely a step in the long journey.I liked how no emphasis was there on having kids or drawing that image of a small happy family...
It's that one soulmate who'd make you willing to give up some freedoms of yours in return for other freedoms and happinesses you never knew existed.The breakup letter is a masterpiece, by far my favorite chapter.
it was not only a great read because it was from a male point of view, but because it taught me much more than I ever expected to learn about love from any book, and especially for one written in novel form...
most important it helped me realize that sometimes one person can be all the roles we seek such as friend, lover and confidante, and other times it may take more than one person but if we truly know what we are looking for then we have a much better shot at finding it...
It is told in a mystical style that explains multi-dimensional soul aspects interacting across time.One of my favorite passages occurs when the writer, Bach, travels to the future and sees his now finished book shelved, and tries to read the title.
When he returns to the here and now, he recalls, "It said something about a bridge." These types of moments when dream sequences give us a glimpse of the future was seared into my brain, and I've fondly tried to follow this type of "seeing" as I develop writing projects.For anyone who longs to find their soulmate, this book will give you hope.
Me? Read a love story? Very out of character for me, but I have always loved this book. I think mostly because it's about real love. Not fairy tale bulls*^t, but terrifying - "I'm exposing myself to you, do not crush me, please" love. The kind you try to sabatoge even though it's wonderful. Read it even if you don't like love stories - if nothing else you get to be a voyeur to a facinating love relationship between 2 adults, that isn't mushy or cheesy.
واقعیت این است که ما همگی در این سیاره، تنها هستیم. هر کدام از ما کاملا تنهاییم و هرچه زودتر این حقیقت را بپذیریم، به نفعمان خواهد بود. بسیاری از مردم تنها زندگی می کنند، چه ازدواج کرده باشند و چه مجرد باشند. بدون هیچ یافتنی، همیشه در جستجو بوده اند...!
We aren't dust, We are magic! The book is highly recommended to those who believe in the concept of soul mates. It has been written as a first hand experience of a writer in quest of his soulmate and then his own fears to acknowledge her and how he manages to overcome them.
This is one book that's resonated with me through my core when I read it years ago, and again recently. This is my kind of love story, and my kind of lady (the woman who would eventually become the author's wife). Love it.
If he starts getting too close with one, he takes off in his plane lest his Freedom be sacrificed.**SPOILERS**By the end of the book he has discovered a different kind of freedom which comes from engaging deeply in a relationship with one woman, whom he calls his soulmate.
A lot of it challenges my worldview, and as Richard implores of his ideas: "Please give me ideas that do no violence to my intuition."The quandry for me comes from my empirical worldview, which, as a wedding of science and mysticism, holds personal experience as the highest truth.
I loved this autobiographical style of writting.As Richard, many of us believe there is one person for us, our one and only soulmate, but it is not so easy journey to find them.Throughout the book, Richard few times kinda pissed me off, but when I thought about it more, He reminded me myself, and also some behavioral patterns that I know very Well from my life experiences, so I kept beining patient.This book gives a Perfect Insider view on men's fear of commitment issues.I recommend it to all guys to read!😉
Šviesu, švelnu ir tyra. Man buvo per maža gyvenimui būdingų Įvairių spalvų. Akiračio praplėtimui ir lengvam greitam paskaitymui tiko. Antrą kartą, tikriausia, neskaityčiau...
Knygą perskaičiau jau antrą kartą ir ji vis dar mano mėgstamiausių knygų viršūnėje. :)
Recenzija par Ričarda Baha grāmatu "Tilts pāri mūžībai" Ričards Bahs ir literatūras klasiķis un sapņains lidotājs no divdesitā gadsimta, no Amerikas.
No vienas puses tas ir metaforisks ar zemtekstu, kas lasītāju, pirms grāmatas izlasīšanas, spēj ieintrišēt.
Rakstnieks romānā ietvēris savas dzīves secīgus notikumus daudzu gadu garumā.
Lasot tālāk citas viņa grāmatas, sapratu, ka pavisam nejauši esmu izdarījusi pareizo izvēli, jo lasot grāmatu liekas, ka iepazīstos ar Bahu personiski, kā ar reālu personu, izdzīvoju līdzi viņa priekiem un bēdām.
Visā grāmatas garumā autors ir ļoti labi radījis priekšstatu par sevi.
Viņa iepazīšana ļauj labāk izprast vēstījumus un pamācības, ko sniedz arī citas viņa grāmatas.
It was such a good read about the fairy tale love affair between Richard Bach and actress Leslie Parrish.
I have included a review from amazon.Amazon.com ReviewBestselling author Richard Bach explores the meaning of fate and soul mates in this modern-day fairytale based on his real-life relationship with actor Leslie Parrish.
Their love affair and happy ending inspired many enthusiastic fans.
Read this as a lesson about love's enchantments and possibilities, but don't count on this book to keep you and your mate on the bridge across forever.
