The essence of Heidegger’s radical adoption of a phenomenological approach to our Being-in-the-World is here and it is an exciting read for anyone who ‘gets’ that this philosophical genius changed forever the way we can and should think about ourselves and the world.While Nietzsche is a polemicist of existentialism against Christian and Hegelian essentialism, it is Heidegger who thinks through why essentialism is absurd and who presents us with a model for the individual human condition (Dasein) that places it firmly in a context of Time, of Heraclitean flux.After Heidegger, it is no longer possible to consider any situation or person as fixed or essential nor to see a person as not embedded not merely in the material but in the social, constructed by their circumstances until that point when they become conscious of their being constructed.The philosophy cannot be summarised without failing to do justice to Heidegger’s insights and the care with which he builds up his anti-system.
now, having read so much more phenomenology, some on Heidegger, some others like Sartre, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, come to this book with more educated eyes.
not that it has become easy, but the original impulse for purchase- it is short, how difficult can if be?- is this time helpful, though it is dense, it is good to have some idea of terms, and if it is only first draft of Being and Time, am still not ready for that climb.
Great little book. Offers some key insights and nuances, especially when it comes to the translator's word choices (Vorlaufen as running ahead to the past=anticipation in S&Z) Ends on an ambiguous note: "What is time?" became the question "Who is time?" More closely: are we ourselves time? Or closer still: am I my time?" Beautiful!!
هایدگر از دید تازهای به مفهوم زمان نگاه میکند. دیدی که محدود به «بودن» یا «شدن» نیست. زمانِ هایدگر، بیتوجه است نسبت به فلسفهی یونان باستان.

This short text comprises a lecture Martin Heidegger delivered to the Marburg Theological Society in 1924, which should not be confused, due to affinity in titles, with Gesamtausgabe 64 (English translation:  The Concept of Time: The First Draft of Being and Time ). The latter elaborates further on the topics in the former, and was submitted to the Journal Deutsche Vierteljahresschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Geistgeschichte in 1924.Hans-Georg Gadamer calls this version the "original form"
But this inauthentic mode of calculating the "nows" indicates yet an authentic mode of living time, that is, living one's own time towards the "indeterminate certainty" of the possibility of death.Now it becomes clear that ordinary time is constituted only because everyday Dasein evades its ownmost possibility and thus slides from the "how" to the "what" of its being.
Then Heidegger argues that authentic time 1) is oriented towards the future, and 2) is precisely Dasein itself as running-ahead, as radical possibility.
This very short lecture will tell you very specifically what Dasein means.
I wish I had read this lecture before I tried to read Being and Time because it’s very clear.
If you’re interested in reading H, but don’t do well with the difficult language in big philosophical texts, this is a good starting point.
If you’re already an expert on the man then I suppose this book can only give you an idea of what he was thinking before Being and Time, in which case you should read only if you appreciate thought process.
Early draft to Being and Time.
Secondly, it gives a you feel for the themes discussed in BT; so if you haven't read BT yet, and aren't sure whether or not you want to take the plunge, then give this a shot and you'll know if you want to go further.
However, if you're well practiced in philosophy, and have not read much Heidegger yet, I would not recommend starting with this book - I would suggest going straight into BT, with the help of a teacher or reading it with a friend.
There are, by far, better Heidegger books out there.
This is an important lecture given by Heidegger in 1924, a few years before he wrote Being and Time , which touches on the same themes, that of an exposition of time through the concept of Da-sein and being-in-the-world.
As Heidegger places himself, his work is not theology, which when it speaks of time is concerned with time from the perspective of the infinite.
What this has in common with philosophy, Heidegger says, is that it is not theology (3).
In any case, this is an interesting presentation of Heidegger’s work in the years leading up to Being and Time .
This book is a good recommendation for those struggling with understanding Sein und Zeit.
Most of the important concepts are introduced with rather practical examples - yes, this is possible, even for Heidegger.
The first part of the book is an overview of the essential concepts in Heidegger's Daseinsanalytik.
The second part is a shorter public lecture, which sort of distills his thinking about Time in the first part.
The biggest achievement of this lecture is that Heidegger knows how to pave the path to an authentic understanding of Time, which does not coincide with measurable time, but rather 'lived' Time.
Only, low rating because it's so short that it doesn't have space to go far enough - bring on Being In Time.
The book consists of four articles related to the concept of time. The first two articles are written by Aristotle and St. Augustine respectively, which are included as prerequisites for the articles by Heidegger. He considers concept of time differently in natural sciences and history, which are focused separately in the two articles brought in. Although the book could be a remarkable source for Heidegger's investigations on time concept, the Persian version with clumsy translation and many errs in the manuscript makes it almost impossible to enjoy and gain as much as it meant to be, from the book.
As anyone who has attempted to delve into Heidegger's philosophy, his writing can get very confusing, and this is no exception, and what might make this even more confusing is the fact that this is a first draft of one of his later-released books, Being and Time, so it hasn't had the time poured over it to be refined.
I'd say definitely read this book if you have an interest in Heidegger, but if you are just looking into phenomenology and philosophy on being, I would keep this at the back of the TBR pile.
Le idee di un giovane Heidegger (il testo propone una conferenza tenuta nel luglio del 1924) sul concetto di tempo. Vengono citati Einstein e Aristotele, come riferimenti per le argomentazioni dell'autore. A mio avviso, però, dietro questo discorso vi è tutta l'intuizione bergsoniana che, in quegli anni, era così di moda da farla sembrare una corrente artistico-letteraria. Tutt'altro. Come ha più volte detto Lévinas, senza il concetto di durata e la rivalutazione del concetto di tempo di Bergson, non ci sarebbe stato il Dasein e la temporalità dell'essere e dell'esserci di Heidegger.
This small text is kind of an introduction scheme to Heidegger's main writings. Was very hard to read, but exotic style makes reading extraordinary experience in terms of aesthetics. The text is about 'Dasein' and Time (Dasein is the source of Time, and Time is the horizon of Being). Dasein can achieve temporality by realizing itself as terminal being.(...)
Solito libro che riprende scritti acerbi di cui si pretende importanza per via di un loro collegamento con opere piÃ mature. Un'operazioncina editoriale, considerando che l'autore avrebbe preferito non vedere pubblicata questa roba.

A nice capsule of the immense crap load which is Heidegger's 'philosophy of being', and reflections on nothing and nothing-ing.
Headache alert!
reading this book was like reading in a language what dosent exist!!!!!
Ese maravilloso momento en el que te descubres entendiendo algo de Heidegger aunque implique eso de ser seres para la muerte.
Finiti
