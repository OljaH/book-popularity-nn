A collection of short stories that Richard had published in Flying Magazine. I bought my (first ) copy on my 18th birthday. It gave the strength to believe in my dream of becoming a pilot. Some of the stories are brilliant in their simplicity, and depth. It might be a little too technical in places. Highly recommended.
I love everything Bach wrote. Don't always agree with his theology, but do his imagery.
An excellent compilation of the wide variety of Bach's capabilities as an aviation author. These short stories entertain and educate as well as give insight to the mind of the writer. Bach to me is comparable to earlier aviation authors along the St. Exupery or Anne Lindbergh genre. It's an easy read as most stories are short, some too much so. Bach has the ability to draw his reader in to his story and sometimes leaves them wanting more when he ends them.
Before I started reading this book, it had NEVER happened to me that I would feel that someone expresses my real and secret thoughts and feelings better than I do by myself. Now I know it's possible. And it's wonderful to see that not only I am a crazy dreamer who's in love with flying, but also a very experienced pilot feels something similar. I am lost for words about this book.
Love the book. It's inspiring and allows to fly up in the sky every time I open it.
I'm not a pilot and never will be, so in my opinion..Some of the stories had some nice points (School for perfection, Found at Pharisee, Letter from a God-fearing man), but mostly it was (for me) an over-enthusiastic rambling on flying, which I do not understand, as personally I am not one of those people.
But I can imagine some people would enjoy it and understand it way better than me, since they might have the need to get away and be free in the air.
He really loves what he does and I am happy for him.
This is great for anyone that loves flying. Bach takes you into the clouds with every detail of the pilots control. Places and scenes you'll never come to know until you've been behind the controls. Adventure in the open skies.
I'm stunned to find out how much of my life has been based on Richard Bach's writings - I guess I could do worse.
i learned to fly
Inspiring... <3
A great read for any pilot.
...makes me homesick for wind and sky ...

This collection of short stories about flight was a really enjoyable read. Lots of beautiful imagery that sparked a deep appreciation for the art. Also some good messages about how to live a good life that are universally applicable.
A set of short essays previously written for aviation magazines. Interesting and insightful.
I studied to be a flight attendant (among other things) because my view is not so great as to fly for a living (although I still want to pursue that pilot license), but I recognize that this book doesn't have much to do with Illusions and Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
I don't think a pilot is a better person that anyone else just for flying, but this is what he wants to let you know on some of this pages.
The good one flyes, the bad one leads a more common life.--------------------Bach is a very religious man, if you take flying as his religion, and that shows a lot in this book.
I very much enjoyed  Jonathan Livingston Seagull, so I was delighted to get to read Richard Bach's stories of being a (human) pilot.
I didn't know much about his personal flying background before reading this collection of stories.
The stories about doing stunt flying for the movies are fascinating - he tells them in a sort of off-hand way while you read along, biting your nails for his sake!
Through all the stories, Bach's love of flying and his uneasiness with the ground and society's pressures comes through and renders him, as he says of authors he himself reads, someone you know as a friend.

Ponovno je Richard Bach napisal mojstrovino, ki nam pomaga dotakniti se neba, ki je naš dom.=====================================Moji najboljši papirnati otroci so zbrani tu.
Prebiram jih in v prazni sobi sam pri sebi vzklikam: "Glej, kako lepa zgodba, Richard Bach!" ali pa "Tale tu je pa res dobro napisana!".Nekaterim se od srca nasmejim, ob drugih se včasih tu in tam razjočem, pa mi zaradi tega niso nič manj pri srcu.
Morda je ta ali oni mojih otrok tudi tvoj.
Morda te bo prijel za roko in odpravila se bosta tja, kjer je tudi tvoj dom, pod nebo.
=======================================RICHARD BACH

I have read this book before on multiple occasions, and it is by far one of the best books I have ever read.
Some of the stories in this book are a little hard to get through, but Bach makes up for it in others.
He perfectly captures the essence of flying, and many of the stories in this book read like they're true!
This book motivated me throughout my primary flight training and I regularly order copies for both pilot and non-pilot friends.
I would definitely recommend this book, and consider it a must read for anyone who loves aviation.
Che dire? L'ho preso pensando di trovare un noioso diario di bordo, un manuale di istruzioni di aeroplani dei quali non sapevo nemmeno il nome...invece ho trovato la risposta a tanti dubbi esistenziali risolti con la semplicità che solo Richard Bach sa usare. È un'autobiografia redatta in racconti e alcuni di questi li ami, altri li odi, alcuni non li capisci, mentre in altri ti ritrovi benissimo manco ti avessero letto nel pensiero...insomma è un libro dannatamente umano...da leggere!
This book wasn't nearly as metaphysical as Bach's other books. Instead, it focused on flying - "A Gift of Wings" is pretty literal! I read this simple, heartfelt book about flying while I was working at a small airport and learning how to fly. It was a pretty powerful combination. How would it stand up? I have no idea.
Finally, I located the dusty paperback after all these years.I read this book so long ago, after Jonathan Livingstone Seagull and Illusions by the same author. All I remember is that I enjoyed A Gift of Wings so much, I didn't want it to end. Now that I have it in hand after twenty years, time to read it again.
I read this many years ago and I loved it. It's a collection of short stories all to do with aviation. Bach's love of flying and of aeroplanes shines out of the pages and inspires. Even after all the years hied prose has the power to enable me to mentally 'slip the surly bonds of earth'.
A book to read and re-read. Although not a flier myself, I was immersed in aviation as an aircraft mechanic in my early years and Richard Bach helps me to reconnect with that wonderful world of flying.
Se percibe en cada frase la profunda pasión del autor por el vuelo. Yo no soy tan friki en cuanto a aeroplanos y mecánica, por lo cual este libro me ha parecido más bien pesado. En lo que me apasiona, probablemente a la hora de comunicarlo a los demás soy tana aburrido como él ;-)
Richard Bach once again touches high levels by analyzing the drama of life in all its limitless horizons. Wonderful.
Free the mind to think beyond learned patterns
A bunch of SHORT stories...maybe skits is a better word. Many are 3 pages. Some as many as 9 pages. I liked some, I dis-liked others.
