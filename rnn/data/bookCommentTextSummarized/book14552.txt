Just wanted to comment on the cover.I always hate buying an edition of a book with movie art on the front.
I know-- it is big money marketing, and there is no stopping it.But I gotta say, with an artist like Frida Kahlo, who painted so many incredible self protraits, it is just so lame to have a photo of Salma Hayek on the cover.When I saw this book I had to laugh.
If I ever buy this, you can bet it will have artwork by the actual artist on the front.
I am a little in love with Frida Kahlo, or perhaps I should say intensely so. Surely no-one can read this superb biography without being spun head over heels. Frida Kahlo was truly extraordinary.  Vast beauty, intelligence, commitments, loyalties...... and most of all - vast creativity and artistic talent. On top of this, the book also contains a formidable and passionate love story, and an inspiring story about her battles against terrible physical injuries . Frida was a gargantuan and lion-hea
I loved this book for the breadth it gives us of Frida's life, not only of the highlights, but of the thousands of little pleasures she shared with Diego and other friends.
I read it in tandem with with the Taschen art book, Frida Kahlo: 1907-1954 Pain and Passion, by Andrea Kettenmann, which gave me access to good reproductions of the pictures being discussed.
This book really needs to be read with an art book with good reproductions of Frida's work.)Highly recommended....-------------------------All illustrations have been photographed from the book Kahlo, by Andrea Kettenmann.["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
This is not an accurate portrayal of Frida's life.
She was more of a revolutionary than this book makes her out to be.
She was also a gender-bending feminist, and a brilliant painter.
Herrera makes her out to be a Diego obsessed, pain obsessed sack of potatoes, and i'm not buying it.
Herrera also infers several things to be true from Frida's paintings.
I am very sorry that this Kahlo has been subjected to pop culture by Herrera, and suggest looking elsewhere to find accurate information!Suggested Reading: Devouring Frida by: Margaret A.
Although Frida's maternal grandfather was indigenous, she had a middle class settler Christian upbringing and dressing in tehuana clothing was a deliberate, political, and perhaps disingenuous act of appropriation, motivated, it seems, by Communist anti-imperialism, aesthetic appreciation and the desire to hide her right leg, which was damaged by childhood polio and became increasingly problematic, probably as her injuries put an end to her therapeutic habits of exercise.It's always hard not to see the life of an artist primarily through their work, but according to Herrera, in many periods of her life Frida painted little.
Frida Kahlo was such a complex indiviual, unfortunately Hayden Herrera simplifies this multifaceted artists life and passions. Like many Kahlo scholars in the 1970's she bases many of her ideas on Kahlo's work on gender stereotypes and assumptions. Read "Devouring Frida" if you are interested in a REAL analysis of the artist's life.
I'm probably the last person under the sun not to have seen Julie Taymor's Frida, based on this biography (which is changing as I write these words).
I find rating biographies difficult - do I rate a book, or a life?
The description of the birth of creativity, and subsequent relations between Frida and Diego, and other people in her life, were interesting, thorough, and touching.
The image of Frida and Diego locating each other in the crowd by means of whistling The International will stay with me.
This book has its faults, pointed out by other reviewers, but I find them minor, not enough to spoil my reading experience.
In Depth, thorough and intriguing. However, I did not always agree with the author's interpretive nature of assuming to understand what Frida was feeling or thinking, and forcing these interpretations by consistent repetition.
A revolutionaryIt's easy to forget that Frida Kahlo lived in a time in which it wasn't common for woman to have a loud and outspoken voice.
She analyses many of her paintings, trying to give them a context and deducting what can be learned from them about the life Frida Kahlo led, yet on various occasions I wasn't quite sure where her claims were coming from.
It's a nice read and gives a wonderful insight into her life and times, yet I was left feeling unsatisfied on various occasions throughout the book, which keeps me from calling this a truly great biography.
تا قبل از اين فريدا را نمي شناختم و خيلي تحت تاثير شخصيت مقاوم و جاه طلب اين نقاش و هنرمند بزرگ قرار گرفتم . داشتم فكر مي كردم فقط يكي از حادثه هاي وحشتناك زندگيش براي تباه شدن زندگي بيشتر زنان ايراني كافي است ! كاش زناني مثل فريدا بيشتر از اين بودند به نظر من قابل افتخارند .

In esso, contro un cielo dall’azzurro brillante, scuro a sinistra e chiaro a destra, si vedono alcune angurie, il più popolare dei frutti messicani, intere, a metà, a quarti, spaccate....Otto giorni prima di morire, quando le sue ore erano immerse nelle tenebre della fine ormai prossima, Frida Kahlo intinse il pennello in una vernice rosso sangue e scrisse il suo nome, la data e il luogo dove il quadro era stato dipinto, Coyoacán, Messico, sulla polpa scarlatta della fetta centrale.
Frida era una donna che della passione aveva fatto il suo tratto distintivo.

(Stricter editing please!) Her pain is both physical and psychological; painting is an attempt to fight back.
She lives with physical pain and illness.
Yes, she reinvents facts, but that is not all I object too.Furthermore, I hate books of art criticism that instruct how you should interpret artwork.
I don't think the book is bad for others who react less negatively to her morals and personal choices.
I don't think it is bad for those of you who want Kahlo's art explained.
I cannot even wait to slam the book shut until after I have read about her affair with Trotsky.
This book is detailed, sometimes excessively.
I felt, while reading this book, I also got an art history lesson.
I remember Frida Kahlo's art as being dark, vulgar, and somewhat childish, but I didn't really know the history behind the paintings and that of Frida's life story.From a young age, Frida Kahlo was outgoing, outspoken, and a prankster.
Reading this book allowed me access into Frida Kahlo's life as not only a painter but as a remarkably strong Mexican woman in the 1930's.
That throughout all her pain and suffering over the years she still felt that life is about love and without love, there is no life.
داستان زندگی نقاش مکزیکی بنام فریدا کالو.کسی که زندگیش هم مانند آثارش آزادی خواهانه بود.و به عصیان زنان در برابر شرایط اجتماعی شان میپردازد .کسی که عشاق زیادی داشت و در زندگی جنسی خود همه مرزها حتی جنسیت را نادیده میگرفت.(در بعضی نقدها خواندم که نقش اجتماعی او با فروغ فرخزاد شاعر توانمند ایرانی مقایسه شده بود!!!) در سال ۲۰۰۲ در هالیوود فیلمی با نام فریدا براساس زندگی او ساخته شد. .
Playing up certain aspects of illness, or exaggerating them at times and demanding more care and attention from others after a surgery - maybe, but not that.Just my opinion.What I know for sure is that Frida was a remarkable and complicated individual and a brilliant artist.
Rated on Kalo, I would have awarded a rating of five, because Frida Kalo is an intriguing and compelling subject, whose life and art are inseparable and awe-inspiring.
The author, I think, may have glossed over important aspects of the artist's political life and focussed incessantly on her relationship with Rivera.
And, most unfortunately, the book's cover is a photogrpah not of the subject, but of Salma Hayak as Frida Kalo in a movie.
An excellent biography: why did any more need to be written?? And I must make clear that I read this book in the D.F. in the 80's after seeing her home in Coyoacan, long before the Frida craze began...Yes, I was ahead of the curve! Yes I am a trendsetter! No I'm not a sheep! seriously, Kahlo is a great artist and I hate how commodified her life and her work have become. Some great artists have as their subject the self, and the self is as rich and vast a canvas as any.
Una biografia appassionante che parla di una delle donne più forti che io abbia mai conosciuto. Donna con la D maiuscola, artista impressionante e talentuosa. Consigliatissima a tutti gli amanti dell'arte e delle donne forti e risolute. Stupendo!
The author writes objectively about Frida's life in these parts and in a way just simply recounts her life and adds passages from other people involved in her life one way or other.The middle part was tough, I grudged through.
I detested the author's way of reducing Frida to this depressive obsessive with no life, no passion, no future, no ambition.
Her whole life was kind of an obsession with one thing or another.
We get to admire her work and learn something about her life and at the same time get a trip down a memory lane.
Frida Kahlo är fascinerande och trollbindande både för sitt liv och sin konst, och dessutom med ett så vackert omslag längtade jag att börja läsa biografin. Och visst är det en biografi med gedigen research bakom och ett engagemang från författarens sida, men som bok betraktat hade det behövts jobba lite på upplägget och framställningen. För mig blev detta mest en långrandig trist historielektion, i brist på bättre uttryck. Biografin hade tjänat på att komprimeras en aning och författaren eller förlaget kunde ha jobba mer på att göra skrivstilen mer läsvänlig.
I read this book in 1998, after seeing a thumbnail image of the Two Fridas in an art history textbook.
I'm waiting to hear Herrera speak now, and I'm bummed that I forgot to bring the bio to have her sign.
In part, because Kahlo's life story was so rich, and also because Herrera's respect for her subject.
There is a scene in the book that happened while Kahlo was being cremated that I seriously thought I dreamed or read in a magical realism novel somewhere.
(See, now you have to read the book to see what I'm talking about!)
One of the best biographies I ever read!Excellent!Hhigly recommended for any art lover and appreciator of this woman's heart.
Very accessible bio of an amazing artist
brilliant!
I love this biography, start to finish. Frida amazes me, and the breadth of this book is astonishing.
Another one where I chose to watch the movie instead of read the book. Good one.
This book really brought Frida to life and included interesting insights into her work...
E' stato un bellissimo viaggio, Frida del mio cuore, sino alla fine.Attraverso le tue parole, le tue lettere, i tuoi colori.Il dolore ha condotto e raggrumato ogni emozione lì dove la tua vita cambiò trasformandosi in Arte, Amore, Morte.Dai da pensare nelle lunghe notti, quando le cicatrici urlano pretendendo attenzione, prendendo vita.Tiho sentita urlare, ti ho vista.E, ancora, ti verrò a cercare.
Which it should be, what with the fact that it's a biography and all.Herrera constructs a detailed, engaging biography that examines the major events of Frida's life--and in particular her marriage to fellow artist Diego Rivera--and sets them against the psychological undertones of her works.
One of the great things about this book is that you get to learn a lot about Rivera, simply because he influenced Frida so much, and vice versa.As interesting as the Riveras' relationship was, I would have liked to see a bit more of Frida's personal life outside of her marriage.
