Exciting read! a family overcoming grief after a plane accident...enjoyable and a lovely story..well written (paperback!)
Sure, it was pretty slow, and nothing really happened until about the second half of the book, but its one of those books that you're satisfied with where you are and what's going on.
But then, by the second half of the book...WHAM!!!!!!
the realistic kind of romance}, action, thrills, betrayal, and well everything.
But other than that, it's a very satisfying book that will leave you smiling.I really loved Danielle Steel's writing style, I loved the way she brought the characters to life, and I love how the book was very realistic, but still managed to blow your mind with surprises your would have never expected.

Damaged, but taking things slowly and with an open mind.
Matt has been faced with a messy divorce and cut off from his children who live in another country; Ophelia is thrown into widowhood and the loss of her son and is very depressed.
A month on the California shore is just what the doctor ordered and Matt is a very dedicated and patient man.
Just when she starts to come around, she is thrown a betrayal from her husband’s grave.
One thing I noticed multiple times were the repetition of a sentence often times within a few pages – sometimes it was a nice reminder; other time redundant.
Decided I should finally read Steele since she sells so many damn books.
Main takeaway here is: why?
Nothing happens in the first half and mostly nothing happens in the second half.
I was treated to endless descriptions of people painting on the beach and having dinner out.
Wasn’t enough romance and wasn’t enough suspense.
Also, women are either submissive or if they are more purposeful, they are punished for their actions (cancer, being shot).
Steele ain’t no feminist.
This book was a world of bullshit and I want my 10+ hours back.
Normally I do not read Daniel Steel, but was low on my normal mystery novels, picked this one up on a whim after reading the cover page. I really did enjoy this book, I rarely ever read romance novels, because I feel if you read one you have read them all. Man meets woman, they have one torrid sexual encounter after the next, someone is jealous, someone wants to run, then all ends well with a wedding. But, after reading this one, I just may give Ms. Steel another read.
When I started reading this book, I found myself rolling my eyes a lot.
'Here we go again' I thought.
Steel is going to repeat things for us, just to make sure we get it.
She even used the same sentence on two pages next to each other!
I was also really sceptical of the story.
Cue more eye rolling for me.
But then, about halfway through the book sucked me in and I fell in love with the story and the characters.
For fans of Steel but not the one to start with if you are new to her work.
" 🎶رواية تفاصيلها تحمل الألم والأمل بنفس الوقت ، يوجد مفاجأة صادمة في منتصف الرواية غير متوقعة ، تُثبت أن الحياة مهما اعتقدنا أنها انتهت بالنسبة لنا فهي لا تنتهي ، ولا تتوقف بسبب فقدنا أحبتنا ، دائماً ما تعطينا الحياة في الوقت الذي نتوقف فيه عن انتظار أي شيء ، شيء لم ننتظره اصلا فينتشلنا من الضياع واليأس .
غريبة تلك الأشياء التي تشتاق لها في الأشخاص عندما يرحلون .وبدأت بالبكاء ، رغم أنها أرادت أن تكون شجاعة من أجله .
أنسى ذلك أحياناً .لأول مرة من سنوات هناك هدف لحياتها .جميعنا نستحق أشخاصاً لطفاء في حياتنا .يمكنك دائماً جلب الأشياء ثانيةً ، ولكن ليس الأشخاص .
I know with so much of good reviews about this book I am the only one giving it one star.
This book is way too predictable, very repetitive, mostly flat with nothing exciting or with not even a tiny twist or anything that you cannot think of.
May be not this time for me :(The tag line says 'Believe in happy endings' and I do but not in such predictable stories where bad is already gone and only good is going to happen and you know what is the end of the story even when you are not half way done.
أول عهدي بالقراءة… يا سلاااام على ذكريات إلتهام الكتب غصبا عن مستواي في اللغة 😅

What is it about Danielle Steel books?
This one choked me up, even though everything in it was either obvious or useless.
A young girl meets a young man artist painting on the beach.
They become friends, and soon he's meeting her mother, and of course they fall in love, despite both their difficult pasts.
Along the way, they work together to save somebody from drowning.
It doesn't affect the rest of the book.
I guess it showed they could work together to save somebody else, so they could also work together to save themselves.
It tracks the same ground over and over again.Yet, it choked me up.
A tragically sad story but riveting. It was the strong friendships that developed during loneliness and grief that had me captivated. The little girl just tugged at the heart and the hero's steady patience was so endearing. Lonely 11-year-old Pip finds a friend on the beach in artist Matt during a summer when her mother Ophelie is suffering from serious depression.
Grandma really wanted me to read Safe Harbor so I gave it a chance and sped through the pages. It was romantic and cute mixed with a betrayal that I couldn't believe. I really loved this and wouldn't mind reading more of Danielle Steel and author I judged as writing 'old lady books' but nope she writes amazing love stories just like Nicholas Sparks
A bit predictable and cheesy at times but overall very enjoyable and touching story. I highly enjoyed it :D
3.5Um livro carregado de emoções fortes, que nos narra os momentos em que batemos no fundo e julgamos que o futuro é apenas uma certeza de que viveremos mais dias de desalento e tristeza. É a prova de que, seja qual for a nossa história de vida, existe sempre uma maneira de ser feliz, à nossa maneira.

Although you can guess what is going to happen at the end, I like the way it is written.Could use a little less repetitions.
This paper book took me quite a long time to finish being one of the remaining ones in my sstash, which I am trying to reduce as I prefer reading e-books (no dust collectors like paper books ;-) ) .
It follows the typical Danielle Steel pattern: in the world of the rich and beautiful, 2 tormented souls accidentally meet, (this time via an eleven year old girl), and ...
I just feel that Mrs Steel's older books had much more to offer.
Even though they also took place in the world of the rich and beautiful, they at least had an interesting, often historical background which kept the reader interested...
طيب واضح من الريفيوهات إني تقريبًا الشخص العربي الوحيد اللي قرر يكتب ريفيو، والريفيو هيكون فيه الكثي
When life turns down unexpected roads, divorce, deAth, and betrayal of the worst kind, matt and Ophelia have a choice to make: to embrace life or give into the despare death has left in it's path.
Matt become a recluse, retired painter who lives in a small, but comfortable bungalow in safe harbour.
He spends his days painting on the beach.
Then he meets, a 11yr old girl, pip and her dog who become frequent visitors.
Matt lost his kids in a divorce and then his ex- wife's selfish medaling and hasn't seen or heard from them in 6 yrs.
It was a slow read but worth the wait. All good things come to those who wait!! Ophelie has lost her husband and son. Her daughter Pip makes friends with a man on the beach, who in the end she ends up falling in love with. She gets shot, almost dies, finds out her best friend was sleeping with her husband and that her child is really her her husbands love child. Her best friend dies of cancer and she ends up with the child.
The writing is very, very well written and overall the book is good but personally, I find it average in the entertainment part, mostly because I don't agree with the author's takeaway message with all these "forgive, forget, and let's all be happy" messages. It's a slow, quiet and lovely but also a sad and melancholic read. But personally, it's not my cup of tea.
Esta novela me ha fascinado. Me ha acompañado en uno de los momentos más difíciles y oscuros de mi vida. Danielle es una autora increíble. Me ha hecho sentir. Cosa que no me sucedía hace bastante en este último tiempo. Gracias a Dios que encontré este libro! No me sentí como una loca, una solitaria.
احببت وصفها للطفله الصغيره وهى تقترب من الرسام لااعلم احسست بالهدوء وصوت البحر من خلال وصفها احزنى ماحدث للام لكن لا اعلم لم احب نمطيه الكتاب احب الروايات التى لا استطيع اتنبا احداثها او تكون بافكار جديده
I liked it! Nice story! It's a fun beach read. A little bit sad, but still very enjoyable.
حزين بطريقة جميلة! كالعادة لازم دانييل ستيل تموّت نص الأبطال :)بس ما عليها الرواية جميلة..
