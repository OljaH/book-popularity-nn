All I really remember is how extremely angry it made me as a 13 or 14 year old that Alec had this great thing going with his horse, the Black, and some random girl shows up and screws it all up.
However I know how she felt when she has to prove herself to a bunch of shovenistic men who believe a women's place is in the home not on a horse.
I also changed the minds of his horse friends.
But to put a young teenage girl who at the time weighed 100 lbs, on the back of a raging stallion, and see how much he calmed down and actually listened to somebody, can open the eyes of a lot of people set in their ways.
That yes girls do deserve, and will and are currently working in the world of horses.
Pam, the titular 'girl', is based on Farley's real-life daughter.
It was apparently his way of consoling himself, because she died in real life.She doesn't die in this book.
And, of course, Henry doesn't like her, which makes him the bad guy, naturally.Oh, and did I mention that we went from Alec being the only one who can ride the Black to Alec and Pam, who is apparently so special and wonderful that the Black loves her, too, and will let her ride him?Yes. This is extremely annoying, and it doesn't end with this book.
This one always made me kind of sad, even as a kid. Alec finally meets a girl, and Henry is not happy about it. Then the girl leaves. In about 20 books, this is the closest Alec ever comes to having a relationship. Just because he owns a horse farm doesn't mean he can't have love!
Efter at have læst det meste af serien, har jeg fået et helt specielt forhold til hovedpersonen.
Det er ikke fordi, jeg ikke forventede det, men i forhold til hvordan forhold i serien ellers bliver bygget op går dette alt for hurtigt for mig.
Det virker ikke troværdig så derfor får den kun 3 stjerner.
Alt der har med heste at gøre i historien er som sædvanligt upåklageligt og virkelighedstro.
Skildringen er kønsroller i historiens tid er også meget realistisk, men dog barsk og man bliver sur på Henry, når man læser den, for hvilket den fortjener 3 stjerner.
This book was honestly so cringe-y. It was definitely very 70's as far as its depiction of girls and hippies.
very very very good book
Probably my favorite of them all =).
LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
I think most girls who read these books were in love with Alec, so I loved the romantic angle with this one
This wasn't a favorite of mine. It almost felt a bit like that touch of death to all authors : the Nod to femenism. That is the absolute worst, worst thing that can happen to a book. This book was not a total fail, but it was much harder to believe in than any of the others in this series. Alec's relationship with Pam seems sudden and uncharacteristic, not to mention undeveloped. There is a good race scene, and some other cool scenes, but for the most part I didn't really care for it.
I would have felt a deep affinity with Pam - her love for freedom and horses.
Not that I ever really grew out of children's books, but I don't read anything over and over and over again.In this book, Alec has just fired a drunken horsehand, when Pam shows up.
Alec is sent back to Hopeful farm on a mission to fire Pam, but he can't.
Pam might be great with horses, but she has no experience racing.I like Farley's take on feminism, he smoothly avoids the worst of the pit falls.
In need of extra help, Alec hires a girl called Pam Athene with fine blonde hair who really has a way with horses.
Even the temperamental Black gets on with her.A fair bit of the book is spent with Alec mooching about getting to know Pam and walking into her room when she is not present.
Alec has definite feelings for her and doesn't want to risk her life.The personal story behind this book is that Farley had a daughter called Pam who died young.

Alec rides the Black in races and trains horses at Hopeful Farm when he is't racing.
The conflict in this book is when Alec hires Pam, and Henry doesn't like girls getting into the horse business.
Pam helps them out a lot because she rode the Black in a $100,000 race.
So, when Pam rode the Black in the $100,000 race and won, she made Hopeful Farm more money to pay off expenses and things.
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horses and drama.
Horse lovers will like this book along with The Black Stallion series.
It is meant to share her love of horses and her free spirit with the readers of the series.For the most part it shows a very dated version of racing, as it should.
Women in Alec's time are just starting to find their way in the racing world and are not at all welcome around most stables, certainly not on the backs of horses going down the home stretch.
9/2012 Farley's love song to his vanished daughter is so poignant, so breathtakingly sad underneath, that it's maybe the most meaningful of all the series.
I want, now, to read an in-depth biography of Farley and see how closely my speculations match up to reality.
Now that I'm someone's mom, and now that I know that Farley wrote this in memory of his own daughter, I find it almost unbearably poignant.
Pam is so idealized as to be a goddess, but she fits right in with the perfect horses.
The horse parts are as exciting as ever, but there's a serious underlay to this one that lingers.
Review- The Black Stallion and the Girl, Walter FarleyYears ago, when I was in junior high, I would visit the library and read every Walter Farley book available.
And then I moved on in life, unaware he continued to write many more books in the Black Stallion Series.
In the 1970s world of racing, girls are only beginning to break the sexual barrier, as stable hands and jockies.
Alec is caught between his trainer's demand against hiring women and his desire to support Pam.This young adult book brings you into a world the author is familiar with--the demands and dangers of racing.
Did Walter Farley write a Manic Pixie Dream Girl before the term was coined?
I really, really think so:Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in films.
Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown (2005), describes the MPDG as "that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."...
Did not enjoy her character at all, and the strange effect she had on Alec, (view spoiler)[not to mention their paper thin romance and Black Sand's rather unnecessary death.
Reading the other Goodreads reviews on this book, I was shocked to see that it is not as well loved as some of the other Black Stallion books.
Pam is my FAVOURITE.
This book was far and out ahead of almost all the others (Black Stallion Mystery being the exception).
The resounding memory I have from this novel is Pam's handling of a young colt who rears.
Though lots of people may feel that her hippiness and the other parts of the story were far-fetched, I think as a child I most connected to this because here was a horse that bonded WITH HER, and then had to go far too soon.
After years as a bachelor, Alec finally meets a girl that sparks his interest. When he does, he is forced to realize just how rooted in the past Henry and his parents are. Of course, the girl he falls for just so happens to do nothing for his case against their sexist beliefs. Still, Alec and The Black agree, Pam is, at the very least, a friend worth having. Filled with more racing greatness, we see Alec at long last open his heart to someone besides The Black. It's an important growth moment for Alec, and Farley handles it well.
Walter Farley's daughter Pam died sometime during this string of the last few books in the series and I think it gives some indication as why they are so bad and have so little heart. This one is rather maudlin in that a free-spirited girl (named Pam, of course) comes to work at Hopeful Farm. There is a love story for Alec, Pam's tragic love for a young racehorse, and Pam's tragic end (much like Farley's daughter). Just sappy to the extreme.
This was one of the less exciting books in the series, but it was ok, although Henry is a huge jerk in this book (how can a man who really wanted a filly to win the Kentucky Derby be so against the idea of female jockeys?). It was sweet that Walter Farley based Pam off of his daughter, although he made her into a Mary Sue. I think that this book was written for himself and for his family, not for his fans.
I read most, if not all, of the Walter Farley Black Stallion books as a child (I was absolutely nuts about horses.) I don't remember a lot about many of them, but this one stuck with me. Alec is disqualified from racing for a period, and meets a girl who also can ride well -- including the Black. I remember this story was a lot darker overall than the other books, and that the ending was not "happily ever after."
This for sure would have been a 5-star review in my childhood, where this was my favorite of the entire series after the first book. But even the power of nostalgia can’t quite redeem a book so poorly dated. Still, there are enough beautiful scenes of horses to justify a 3-star rating.
I enjoyed the characters, and their world and hope I get the chance to read the story again and/or to read more within the series.My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
This was my favorite book in the series. I'm not sure why, but I remember reading it over and over. The first chapter is pretty much burned into my memory. Although the one I read had a very different cover.
I raced through this series as a child. Of course, "The Black Stallion" was my favorite, and I read it a few times, but I waited eagerly for any of the books to return to my branch of the library so I could snap them up.
I didn't really like the romance, it was annoying and cheesy which felt unreal to me, but I think it's interesting how Walter Farley was trying to describe his sadness for the loss of his daughter through another perspective.
