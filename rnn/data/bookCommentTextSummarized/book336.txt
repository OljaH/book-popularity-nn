(B+) 76% | GoodNotes: A volume divided into two tiers of quality. Heavily reliant on gimmickry and clear retreads of earlier Holmes stories.
‘The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes’, like all the other collections, is a must read for every mystery fan. As always, some stories are better than others, but all are pure Sherlock at his best. While not the most famous of Sherlock’s cases, Shoscombe Old Place and The Illustrious Client are excellent examples of the Sherlock canon, while The Blanched Soldier and The Lion’s Mane, both narrated by Holmes, are unique variations on a tried and true format. Yet, perhaps the best story in the entire canon, is The Problem of Thor Bridge, a classic locked room tale!
This is the final Sherlock Holmes book, and while it is enjoyable, I think "Casebook" is the weakest collection of Sherlock stories.
Having gone through all nine books this summer, it really seems like Doyle was so tired of the character that he was phoning it in by the 1920s.
I'm sad that my summer of Sherlock is now over.
I've spent the past two and a half months listening to the marvelous actor Derek Jacobi narrate all nine books of Holmes, and he really made the great detective come alive.
Yes, when I closed this book after my workout today, I also said goodbye to Sherlock Holmes as but I definitely enjoyed reading the whole canon.
This book, his last collection of 12 (out of 56) short stories has works that deviated from the usual Watson as the narrator.
This is one of the two short stories that are narrated by Sherlock Holmes instead of his partner, Dr. Watson.
I liked how the deductions were done by Holmes in the story.
– 3 STARSThe Adventure of the Creeping Man. Professor Presbury is acting strange and his personal secretary, Mr. Bennett seeks the help of Holmes and Watson.
My final Sherlock Holmes! A joy to read, like the rest of the short stories - I can't believe I've actually finally read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
Press collection The Best Science Fiction of Arthur Conan Doyle; the Holmes stories avoid use of actual supernatural elements (though Doyle wrote supernatural fiction with other characters), but this is a good example of the few that use science fictional elements.
The two-part episode The Last Vampire (which is actually feature-film length, and which I taped on VHS and re-watch occasionally) was based on one of the stories here, "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire," and I've wanted to read the latter ever since seeing the TV version.
It is Sir Doyle. Can you expect anything less than completely entertaining and genius stories?  “Life, it turns out, is infinitely more clever and adaptable than anyone had ever supposed.” I can't even say much about this book except that I stayed up till 4 am reading because I love Sherlock Holmes. My Favourite story has to be The Problem of Thor Bridge and The Adventure of Sussex Vampire.
As to Watson, age and experience become him; and his warning to one who has tried to steal his notes is priceless.Marring my enjoyment of a few of these stories were some racist elements, though it’s true those may be considered thoughts belonging to the characters and not to Doyle himself, who seems to have been a fairly progressive thinker for his time.
It was also odd to have two stories in which Englishmen have married Latin American women said to have “tropical” natures, due to their country of origin.
A Rather Clever Collection7 July 2017 (Great Australian Bight) Well, that was annoying. I had finished writing my review of the Case-book last night while I was sitting on the plane, saved it to my external harddrive, packed up my bag and then headed off to my parent's house. When I got there I suddenly discovered that my external harddrive was missing. Fortunately I had backed the harddrive up on my desktop at home, however I hope that the harddrive basically disappears as opposed to ending up
It felt as if Doyle had gone back to his original style as opposed to just a collection of murder mysteries – these stories seem to be more like puzzles than anything else.
The collection itself was interesting, and did seem to work more like a guessing game, though of course, as with Doyle's other works, it generally turns out that there is something that Holmes knows that he isn't letting on so it isn't necessarily possible to actually work out the solution to the puzzle.
Like the previous collection, these stories aren't in chronological order, and one of them isn't even written by Watson (it is narrated by Holmes).
I enjoyed this collection more than those in His Last Bow. My favourite being The Adventure of the Lion's Mane.

The latter two, "The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier" and "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane," are not quite as disorienting, with Holmes speaking directly to us, the readers, in much the same way he usually addresses Watson."Case-Book" also contains one truly bad story, "The Adventure of the Creeping Man," and one that's almost a rewrite of an earlier, far superior Holmes story: the plot of "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs" is almost identical to that of "The Red-Headed League," from 1891.Most of the book's other stories, though, are more enjoyable, while still paling in comparison to Doyle's earlier work.
As usual some of the short stories were a tad predictable but overall they were all quite entertaining.
I liked the more modern setting of the early 1900s compared to the late 1800s of earlier stories, it made things seem a bit more refreshing.
One thing that I really disliked about the series was Sherlock's claim that more or less every case was the most complex or most interesting he'd ever come across, it just made me roll my eyes.
All in all, I'm glad I've finally finished with the Sherlock series, I was getting rather tired of the formulaic way Sherlock/Watson investigated their cases.
This is the last collection of Holmes stories before Sir Arthur's death, when he was churning them out for money.
I found this interesting to read knowing that Sir Arthur absolutely despised Holmes by this time in his career, and also, somehow I missed this collection!
So it was a delight to read new-to-me Holmes tales...
Also, Doyle experiments with tales told by Sherlock himself, and the third person, which is an interesting departure!
On the down side, this collection is, well, weak.
Doyle's frustration seems to be finding vent in some very dark and vengeful stories and resolutions.
With this book I have re-read the entire Sherlock Holmes canon. I loved every minute and will probably do it again several times with whatever amount of time I have left to me.The complete canon would be a great desert island suggestion.A tip--get these books with the original illustrations. Makes them even more fun.
After a year, I've read all Sherlock Holmes books, at last.
I loved each one of them and this whole world created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle changed my life.
Can't say why I love one more than another: I've always, completely, followed my instincts.
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (★★★★★)2.
The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (★★★★★)3.
The Hound of the Baskervilles (★★★★★)4.
The Valley of Fear (★★★★★)5.
The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (★★★★★)6.
The Return of Sherlock Holmes (★★★★☆)7.
A Study in Scarlet (★★★★☆)8.
The Sign of Four (★★★★☆)9.
His Last Bow and Other Stories (★★★★☆)
On the one hand, Conan Doyle's prose skills have developed considerably from the early days of A Study in Scarlet and his handling of both atmosphere and the Holmes/Watson relationship is rivalled perhaps only by that series peak, The Hound of the Baskervilles.
In truth, it's 2 stars for a non-Holmes fan, and 2-and-a-half if you know and love the guy already.The bad:One of the most frustrating elements of this book (admittedly a collection of individually-published short stories) are how often similar character tropes pop up.
Read The Hound of the Baskervilles and any of the other, earlier short story collections - Adventures, Memoirs or The Return.
Λατρεύω τον Σέρλοκ Χολμς αλλά το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο το βρήκα λίγο βαρετό. Μπορεί να φταίει που ήταν συλλογή διηγημάτων (και θα έλεγα ότι δεν μου αρέσουν ιδιαίτερα τα διηγήματα), άλλα το βρήκα δύσκολο σε πολλές περιπτώσεις να κρατήσω το ενδιαφέρον μου ζωντανό. Κάποιες από τις ιστορίες μου άρεσαν και τις βρήκα ενδιαφέρουσες, αλλά σε άλλες έπρεπε να πιέσω τον εαυτό μου να συνεχίσει να διαβάζει.
Το Σημειωματάριο του Sherlock Holmes είναι η συλλογή των τελευταίων περιπετειών που έγραψε ο Doyle για τον διάσημο ντετέκτιβ και τον βοηθό του.
Παρόλο που η δομή των ιστοριών παραμένει ίδια με τις υπόλοιπες, η θεματολογία είναι αρκετά πιο σκοτεινή και αρκετές περιπέτειες έχουν έναν πιο "Gothic" χαρακτήρα.
Η αφήγηση δεν γίνεται πάντα από τον Watson (κάτι το οποίο ήταν δεδομένο σε όλες τις προηγούμενες ιστορίες) αλλά σε μερικές αναλαμβάνει ο Sherlock τον ρόλο του αφηγητή (σε αυτές απουσιάζει τελείως ο Watson).
Αρκετοί κριτικοί υποστηρίζουν ότι το βιβλίο περιλαμβάνει τις πιο "φτωχές" περιπέτειες που έγραψε ο συγγραφέας.
Although some of the stories in this collection have the classical characteristics – Holmes being a prick and using his deductive and acting skills to solve mystery, Watson with his modesty and loyalty and a range of queer cases; yet mostly this novel is rather disappointing.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was rather tired of this character by the time he wrote this book.
Reading them made me realise how fond I am of Watson as a character.
I liked Sherlock from the very beginning but it is only on finishing the last novel that I have realised how much I adore Watson too.

The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes, #9), Arthur Conan Doyle
*WARNING: VERY, VERY LONG!*Don't read this if:1. You have not read the book yet2. You have no sense of humour“The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes“ is the final collection of Sherlock Holmes stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. The collection I have has 10 stories:1. "The Adventure of the Illustrious Client"2. "The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"3. "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone"4. "The Adventure of the Three Gables"5. "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire"6. "The Adventure of the Creeping

"The Adventure of the Creeping Man"The story is narrated by Doctor Watson and it’s set in September 1903.
"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane"The story is narrated by Sherlock.
Sehr durchwachsen. Manche Geschichten haben mir gut gefallen, andere gar nicht. Insgesamt konnte ich mich auch nicht so ganz mit der Kürze der Geschichten anfreunden, da baut sich für mich persönlich nicht genug Spannung auf.
It's been a fun journey, I've seen a writer grow and employ his skills better and better.
These stories were excellent, fun, inventive and up to the "Holmes standard".
Instead, in a couple of stories, Holmes gets called in in, well, seemingly domestic problems ( of course, in the end the problems always turn out to be well within the criminal spectrum, or at least bordering on it ).
Most stories are shorter than the standard short story, which is about thirty pages and the writing seems..
This collection features two stories that are narrated by Holmes himself, which is quite refreshing.
I know that my previous reviews were not much useful to understand my real feeling toward their stories, however I can swear that I truly love them.
It was a pleasure to read their adventures, because it was my opportunity to prove my intelligence, to see if I would have been able to solve the mystery like Sherlock did, or if I would have stared in amazement the final revelation.
Anyway, it was an amazing thrill.It was a great ending, tho.
Anyway, I really enjoyed these short stories, I really had great times with them.Oh, I feel so sad.
The ninth and final volume of the Sherlock Holmes canon is once again a collection of short stories; the fifth collection.
The short story that gave the previous collection its title – His Last Bow – is the last of all the stories in terms of chronology and would have made a fitting finale to the phenomenon that is Sherlock Holmes.
(Conan Doyle recognises that this must be the end in the preface to this collection by begging the Sherlockians to allow him to let his creation fade away!) Although there are some great short stories in the later volumes, they tend to be concentrated in the earlier volumes, and the four novels are even better still.
My least favorite of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story collections. Probably 3.5 stars, all but a couple stories remind me of listening to the Rolling Stones post 2000 (appreciate the work, but it is obvious the exceptional stuff was done 20 years previous). Still here and there I found the Case-Book enjoyable, the rest of the stories seemed phoned in. Doyle wasn't carving new channels here, but his craft was still formidable.
I thought that the final Holmes short story collection was the weakest of the lot - perhaps one as a reader is a bit satiated even with these great stories when one has gotten this far, or it may be true that the author was thoroughly fed up with his hero by here. Anyway, does not matter much, the rating is still a (possibly rounded up) 4-star and this is well worth your time.
My thoughts on each of the Case (view spoiler)[The Adventure of the Mazarin StoneThis one was short and dumb like he literally sat in the room pretending to be his life like replica, it was stupid.
The Adventure of the Veiled LodgerThis one was sad, this poor woman mistreat by two men that she thought loved her, and even though her love was not brave enough to save her from the lion that mutilated her or love her after she was mutilated she won't give him up for the murder of her horrible husband, but at least it ended with her find a reason to live.
