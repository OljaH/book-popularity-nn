So he, of course again, decides to seduce her XD They had their happy moments, but i'm kinda upset the first sex took so long to happen :PPP But oh well XD Drustan and Dageus appeared in this one, oh how I loved that part <3 <3 And one of the best scenes is when they see Adam hahahahahah that was great :)The ending - wow the ending was just perfect!
I really didn't see it in the previous book in the series, and I think KMM has done a great job making me believe in Adam's "change of heart" - figuratively speaking, since Faes don't have hearts.Gabby was funny and likeable, but not really remarkable.
Anyway, that wasn't enough to ruin the story for me.This book was nicely tied to the previous ones in the series - I particularly liked how Adam made everything "right" for Circenn and Lisa, the H/h in The Highlander's Touch -, so this is one series that definitely must be read in order.

Yay, I love these Scottish men...Once again a great installment in a wonderful humorous, romantic hot, very well-written series.
Gabrielle is cursed with the ability to see both worlds, Mortal and Faery, and Adam needs her.
Amusing, romantic, steamy and just greatThis was the third for me in this "time-travel" series (loved part #4 ★★★★★ and #5 ★★★★☆).
It seems to be one book a year for me but it's always good to be back in this wonderful Highlander land again.
~ It will be more books / audiobooks in this series and I'll not wait another year.*********************************************I LIKE - men like Adam...
So, I was trying to ease my Fever withdrawal pains by reading one of Moning's Highlander romances.
I should have known it wouldn't work for me after hearing this, right at the beginning:Adam Black:Tuatha De Danaan, a rogue even among his own kind.
His favored glamour is that of an intensely sexual Highland blacksmith with a powerful rippling body, golden skin, long black hair, mesmerizing eyes.
Highly intelligent, lethally seductive...- from the O'Callaghan Books of the Fae, LondonSo, Adam is some powerful fae and all he cares about is looking like a sexy blacksmith with long hair?
Adam Black has piqued my curiosity in the previous Highlander books: A larger than life Fae, a Tuatha De, arrogant, sparkly beautiful, seductive, unpredictable, sexual, a player, Queen’s consort.
He loves playing with the humans’ lives, plotting and pretending being God.Gabrielle "Gabby" O’Callaghan is a Sidhe-seer and she has the ability to see both worlds; mortal and faery (once again I wish I had read this series before Fever...).Gabby is trying very hard to live a normal life.
This is something that her grandmother taught her…because fairies are manipulative, soulless, and incapable of feeling anything.
How can he fall in love, when he is not supposed to feel anything.This is by far my favorite book in the series.
I adore this book.
Adam Black *dreamy sigh* is an immortal dark Fae prince with an abundance of mischievousness, arrogance, dangerous unpredictability, and a devilish insatiable sexuality.
The story begins with Adam being punished by the Faery Queen (who adores him, of course) for his repeated interference with his "toy" humans.
Gabby, a Sidhe-seer, has the ability to see both worlds; mortal and faery.
Unfortunately, danger intrudes on this sensual pursuit and Adam’s quest to regain his immortality immerses them into the deadly politics of the Tuatha De.Adam is by far my favorite character of the series.
Poor Adam is being punished for doing something good, but because of his meddling in the human world, he’s been rendered powerless in his own.
Gabby is feisty, strong, smart, beautiful, and very lonely, my heart broke for her.
The two of them can’t deny the overwhelming desire they have for one another and as they journey together to bring Adam back to his world, they start to fall in love.
The MacKeltars and Adam had my heart a flutter and I was quivering and quaking!
My heart pounded, I was breathless and teary-eyed when I read this beautiful, emotional ending and epilogue, and then went back and read it again and again!!
4.75 StarsAdam Black has been the only constant character through out this series and to be honest although he is drop dead gorgeous (and I would never ever kick him out of bed given the chance) I didn't think I would like his book all too much because he has always been such an arrogant tool.But *hangs head in shame* I should have had more faith in Karen Marie Moning - she has never disappointed me before.
To be honest I would probably say this was my favourite book in the series (although I have loved them all).

His favoured glamour is that of an intensely sexual Highland blacksmith with a powerful rippling body, golden skin, long black hair, and dark, mesmerizing eyes.
Oh *sighs dreamily* Adam Black, sex is not the answer.
-	Gabrielle O’Callaghan, on Adam Black.
This of course is the story of Adam Black and Gabrielle O’Callaghan and is easily the best I have read so far in this series.
Gabrielle withstood Adams charms for an awfully long time and just when you think something was finally going to happen – they get ....interrupted.
I haven’t laughed out loud in a book like this for a long time.

I can't believe that I had never read a KMM book before I started this series....I must have been on another planet ;)This was another fantastic addition to the Highlander series.
I loved meeting up with Drustan & Gwen and Degeus & Chloe again and see how they are getting on.KMM sure knows how to tell a good story and get us drooling over the sexy men, she even includes strong and fabulous heroines but her endings and epilogues are absolutely amazing, and this one had me reaching for the tissue box again.
I hope we see more of them all in the next installments.
Adam Black, is part of the Tuatha De Danaan who are an advanced race of immortals.
He's arrogant, unpredictable, unbelievably sexy and can seduce anyone that carries the X chromosome."He had a come-and-get-me-baby-I'm-pure-trouble-and-you're-gonna-love-it kind of attitude."He's so sexy, he makes me want to growl, GRRRRRRR!
;)Aiobheal the Queen of the Tuatha De's punishes Adam for his interference in the world of mortals.
She strips him of immortality and powers.
I will be both venom and antidote, your poison and your only cure.Adam needs to persuade Gabby in helping him restore his powers and immortality.
There should be a vaccine against Adam Black. And all women should be given it at birth.    If I swoon any further from this series I would just melt into the floor/pavement/W.E. Although I didn't get enough of my favorite Kilt wearers, but what I did get was Adam Black and this dole been approved. Story resumes shortly before the events of   end. Adam is paying the price for challenging the Queen in front of the court, by being made "human" (with all the human cravings and needs) and placed i
a beautiful Sidhe-seer who can see him.Gabrielle could see fairies since she was little, which is a dangerous thing.
She was to ignore and pretend like she doesn't see them as her only protection.But when Gabrielle meets Adam...
However, things don't go according to plan as a long time rival strikes to destroy Adam at his weakest.
As a cocky (no intentional pun intended)Fae who had all the women falling over him, Gabby is frigging hilarious resisting him, especially when she meets him 2nd time around by (view spoiler)[ busting his lip, head-butting him and kneeing his junk.
5+++ IMMORTAL STARS!!!!  "But, second and most important, Gabby,she'd said softly,the question you must ask yourself isn't, will you get a Happily-Ever-After? The question you need to ask yourself is, will you be able to live with yourself if you don't let yourself have a happy-now, andend up having had nothing at all?

You were firing questions at me today, trying to get inside my head.You asked if I believed in God.I told you of course I do- I've always had a strong sense of self.Your house is quiet now, you're sleeping upstairs and I'm alone with this blasted, idiotic book that purports to tally the sum of my life, and fact is, maybe I do.
I loved all the characters, their quick wit and banter; and I can safely say this book is one of my favorite paranormal romance novels I've ever read.
Tatmin olmadım. Yorum gelir. Adam Black is my new bitch, stay away.
Oh, let's not forget that the lead woman (in the majority of the Highlander novels) is a virgin so her first time is well-treasured and appreciated by the man.(4) Lady and the said seductive man would then ensue in some sort of battle or final showdown with the villain(s) of the novel, meanwhile have more sex in between whenever and wherever possible.(5) Battle with the bad guys is finally won but somehow, someway the couple gets separated.
Here's a summary of EVERY FREAKING BOOK IN THIS SERIES: The heroine: an unsuspecting, blonde, beautiful, petite (except Circenn's wife), 20-something year old virgin has finally made a life for herself from her less than perfect upbringing.
She can feel that her life's not perfect and there's something missing in it.The hero: he's a six and a half foot, beautiful/handsome beyond belief, physically brawn, and more powerful than everyone around-alpha male.
For myself, once I complete the bundle (books 1-7) which I'm determined to get my money's worth from, I doubt I would read or recommend Ms. Moning's Series to anyone.Happy reading,Rae
Stripped from his Fae powers and forced to live in the human world, Adam Black has never felt so vulnerable in his entire existence.
Plagued with this burden her entire life, Gabby finds herself hating the Fae and even more, hating her undeniable attraction for them.When Adam seeks Gabby out to ask her to help him find his son Circenn in order to bring him back to face Aoibheal, sparks fly and the chemistry sizzles as Gabby tries to resist Adam’s charms.
**Reread Review May 18, 2016**4 1/2 "I do believe in Fairytales" Stars!So very, very good!
This one starts off a bit slow, but the ending is so worth it.
I love Adam Black!
Happy reading!**Original Review February 27, 2014**Wow, Adam...
Well, for most of the book I was thinking this is a 4star story.
Actually I was thinking this book is really moving slow.
I'd expected lots of action from Adam Black's story.
Then the last few chapters came and Adam did what he does best.
He surprised me.
Actually Ms. Moning surprised me.
Happy reading!!
The books are basically formulaic -- (1)Our heroine is a virgin.(2)Our hero is gorgeous, sexy, large, and well endowed.(3)There is travel either to or from to Scotland or both.(4)There is fae magic or mischief.(5)Our hero and heroine seem to get separated.(6)There is a nice tearful reunion.(7)There is a happily ever after.
She spend a lot of time avoiding Adam, but he keeps reappearing until she agrees to help him.
Adam is being pursued by Darroc (hmmm...wonder if he will appear in the Fever series somewhere) and Adam and Gabrielle end up in Scotland at the MacKeltar's castle.
I loved how this book showed the MacKeltar brothers' happily ever after with their women.
Got yerself in deep this time.Thank goodness for Gabrielle the Sidhe-seer (she sees the Fae while they walk amongst us invisible to most)!Adam Black, the Fae prince is suffering his punishment under the Fae Queen.
But there is more going on than she or even he knows.He needs to contact her to plead forgiveness, but he is invisible to humans and the Fae are invisible to him.
She was seriously afraid for her life!Adam is used to women falling at his feet, and he figures he knows just how to seduce a woman's help after over 1000 years of practice.
I loved that this book really felt like an extension of the Fever series!
Bringing Drustan and and Dageus back and tying Christian's family to Adam was genius!
There is so much crossover Fever goodness in this one.
Although, I'd really say to start at book 4 and get caught up with Drustan and Dageus first before getting to Adam's story if you have the time.Adam Black's story gives me so much hope for V'lane!
I want V'lane to have the chance to feel human emotions like Adam got to when his Fae layers were stripped down.
I must be going thru a smut phase, and Karen Marie Moning is a reliable source. Make no mistake, the Highlader does not in any way compare to her Fever series; however, it provides a satisfying read and you can easily delve into the world without having read the other books within the series.If you can look past the insta-devotion, survival instincts being construed as "fiery passion few possess" and the fact that our hunk has chosen a Highland Blacksmith as his chosen form (random much?), you should be able to enjoy this read easily enough.
AMAZING!!!!! Adam Black is my #1 KMM man.
So, Adam Black wallows in self-pity (sorta) until he meets Gabrielle, a law-student who happens to suffer from an affliction - she can see the Fae, even through their glamor.
Eventually, they are forced to work together to save the Seelie Queen from the threat of Darroc (the 'Lord Master' *snicker* from the Fever series).Adam Black is ridiculously hot.
In fact, at times, I don't even care about the story because I love learning about him, talking about him, seeing how his mind works.
OOOOoooo! This series is the best highlander series I have EVER READ! I am so sad and disappointed that she has decided not to add on to this! I want one for my own! MMmm Mmmmm Mmmmmm! I just can't get enough of this family! HOT STEAMY & A great mystery, curses & a twist of paranormal whether it be fae berserker or time travel, I love them all!
5+++ starsLOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!Loved the storyline, the fae references that tie back to the Fever series. Absolutely LOVED Adam Black!Hands down, my absolute favorite in the series! I'm ending the series here since I don't think anything can top Adam Black!
I was *this* close to being convinced that I should change it to two stars, but then the ending. It slew me. So back to one star, it is.
Adam Black.
This book took us all on a brilliant tour of magicke, fairies and love.
Adam Black is finally explained to us.
Now, I would like to know why men all over the world are not walking around with waist-length, silky, black-as-sin hair?
Hell, maybe even the wrong millennium, because most men around me are either bald or balding or have really close-cropped hair.
Why don't you?The lovely insight into the character of Adam Black aside, the current virgin-protag Gabrielle is hilarious.
I screamed with laughter when she had the audacity to kick Adam Black in his balls.
Oh god, so I'm still a little embarrassed about my love of these books since they were my first taste of a romance series.
But if I'm being honest with myself, if KMM writes 50 of these, I'll happily devour them and get all giddy at the predictable, soulmate/eternal-love-finally-found conclusion.
I am however, a little over all the sexifying and how cut and paste it has been throughout the series.
And I would be happy if I never read the words "puckered crest" again, they cropped up in all 7 of these books!The thing is, I just love the way KMM writes and sets up her stories.
