Charmspeak: check.

He loves you; stop breaking his heart!" (hide spoiler)] Plus, Percy is more mysterious, calculating and dark: proof Hazel and Frank individually matured so much!
Nico stole the limelight  because  really  after that character development, how could he not?!
In-depth character analysis hereThis book is epic!
Another amazing novel by Rick Riordan! Cant wait to start the next novel and see how this all ends!
But I expect a lot of romance cause what better place to spend time with your boyfriend than in hell ;) (view spoiler)[Direct quote from Rick: "The one thing I can promise regarding “The House of Hades” ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of “Mark of Athena”, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in.
As much as I love Percy, I'm not sure if Rick will include his perspective again.
But I have a real important thing to say ...Please do NOT rate the book alreadyI know, you love Riordan.
Though I don't like the pro-Camp Jupiter feeling I'm getting from Percy, Jason choosing Camp Half-Blood was a nice little twist!
Oh, I'm sure the cover will be amazing as always.As much as I'm SO EXCITED for this next book, I don't know how I feel about Percy Jackson ending.
The only thing that made me feel (just a tiny bit) better was when Nico said that Percy was the best demigod ever and I was like: "take that Jason!" Don't get me wrong, I like Jason.
Can't wait for House of Hades EEEEEEEP!Rick isn't too cruel so Percy and Annabeth will probably make it but it's still super sad.
I ship him to Calypso by the way but I don't have faith much in this two since Calypso is in her world.Piper: I'm glad she is moving to help her friends.
Her fight with ice-gods are awesome although her relationship to Jason still didn't improve, oh Piper dear, I think you are in the verge of heartbreak.Jason: I'm glad he has a numerous POV in this book!
Drinking fire, getting help from Bob and Damasen, their love is so strong and i can't wait for book 5 for their happy ending.NICO: Okay, so his name is in caps and bold BECAUSE OF HIS REVELATION sakldjjsfhjsahfgdghjhhdfkghdksjadfhkjasgrf I CANNOT!!
I can't wait for the book 5.
(A-) 83% | Very GoodNotes: Pulsating panic, its heroes mature by individual valor, personal pain, and facing down the monsters of memory lane.
It's like everything is possible when Hazel is in underground, (view spoiler)[she can even sort of teleport Leo, Percy and Annabeth!
I just read Riordan's blog and he wrote this:The one thing I can promise regarding The House of Hades ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of Mark of Athena, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in.
(view spoiler)[I think House of Hades would be told from Jason, Frank and Hazel's POV.
(hide spoiler)] I mean, I like Hazel and Frank with Leo joining the mix but Jason?
And then I abandoned all my review books so I could read The House of Hades ASAP because...
Proceed onwards!Picking up from where the torturous The Mark of Athena left off, we have Hazel, Frank, Leo, Jason, Piper, Nico and Coach Hedge on the Argo II, on the way to meet Percy and Annabeth on the other side of The Doors of Death.
Oh, geez. Oh, wow. This. Me. Now.Give it to me before I freak out.Too late.LOOK AT THAT COVER!!!!
“Bob says hello" AND I BROKE IN TEARS. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME.
But seriously, I love you guys." After reading that dedication page, I just died a little from the awesomeness that is Rick Riordan.
You are officially my favorite author, the author who not only is able to transform a wonderful world of mythology into a gripping story that captures you from page one with wonderful characters that you all fall in love with, but an author who introduced me to the wonderful world of reading at the age of 10 with the Lightning Thief.
It grips you, but Riordan's style of story telling just makes it impossible for the reader to like put the book down to go do work.
“You cannot control your parentage, but you can choose your legacy”As always, Rick Riordan doesn't disappoint.
Action, fun, more action, gods and monsters, legends and heroes, love, revenge and friendship.
Sometimes I got a bit weary, the page count is quite big in this one.
But then with such a big cast of characters, it's no surprise.
It's actually really quite impressive how Riordan manages to give everybody a fair share of the spotlight.
He deserves to be lucky...and I deserve to see him with a love interest that I can swoon over.Find more of my books on Instagram
Post reading:*Long sigh*Review to come.Edit:I'm changing my mind about Frank's percentage.I give him a 75% chance of survival.But Lyza, you say, isn't Frank the most likely to die?
I could easily be wrong.50 days to go!EDIT:COVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVERCOVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT'S SO PRETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...He's going to kill off Leo isn't he.I mean, think about it, even though I'm a Leazel fan, I think it's pretty obvious that Frank and Hazel will end up together, and Percy and Annabeth...You know what, I think I'm just going to state survival percentages because I'm still in a coma from MOA and I need to straighten out my mind.
Now I can relax . I don't wanna say it but it's true. Regardless of so much tension here, I can relax now 'cause my favourite ship of all time is safe. Safe from the Hell! I mean it. Hell! This book was as amazing as I expected it to be. I liked how things were carried out. => Doors of Death. One end in the mortal world, another in Tartarus. I thought they were kind of black-hole-ish type. But no. They were elevators. This fact was amazing that they were held by chains in both places. And th
Regardless of so much tension here, I can relax now 'cause my favourite ship of all time is safe.
Safe from the Hell!
This book was as amazing as I expected it to be.
One end in the mortal world, another in Tartarus.
And they had to cut them to free the Doors and stop the coming of more monsters in the mortal world.=> Hecate, goddess of magic, got a little spotlight here.
Her interaction with Hazel made the book amazing.
Every time he appeared, he got something.
Regardless, I love him.
But you will be destroyed by Tartarus himself.
****SPOILER ALERTS!!***DO NOT read unless you have read the House of Hades at least once!--------------------------------------------------Amazing is an understatement.Even the Lightning Thief is not that great compared to this.On a scale of 1-5 stars, it deserves a 20.When a reader writes a Fan-fiction, he/she writes what they want to happen in the book.
They may not think so, but they do.
I mean, who would get a chance to change the future and change it for the worse?
This book was like a Fan-fiction.
Everything I wanted to happen...happened.
Piper realizing that "the world must fall" means "Gaea must fall"...and much more.

Part of my "Huge Review Binge 2k15" (aka trying to catch up on reviews I haven't done in the past two years)Date read: December 16th, 2013Date reviewed: July 16th, 2015----------*WARNING* Probably contains spoilers for the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and the other Heroes of Olympus books.
But I will try not to get them confused.)Ah yes, don't you love it when your author literally ends a book by dumping your favorite characters straight into hell?
Still, I felt like there was good character development in this book and we get to know all the characters more.I liked Riordan's portrayal of Tartarus and all the obstacles Percy and Annabeth have to face.
Epic and wonderful just like all Rick's books. Just posted my full review/bootalk: http://youtu.be/lQvEcfsmCP4
Final rating: 6/5 stars  Love is no game! It is no flowery softness! It is hard work—a quest that never ends. It demands everything from you—especially the truth. Only then does it yield rewards.   This book is H.E.A.R.T.B.R.E.A.K.I.N.G. Like STOMP-ON-MY-HEART-IT-WILL-BE-LESS-PAINFUL-THAN-BREAKING-MY-HEART-INTO-PIECES. I didn't except Rick Riordan to raise his level of angsty situations to a whole different level. But he did it. And i loved it (oh my god i am a M).  STORY  : After that nasty cli
- i didn't really love him from the start, he seemed kind of stand by character, but now he had changed and i love it how he accepted other people (even when he was distrustful before toward them - especially to Nico, after he learned about him - he became supportive pillar for Nico).
He would do anything for Annabeth, but sometimes he lost control and almost became what he didn't want (for Annabeth to be afraid of him like when Percy almost (view spoiler)[ killed Misery with her own poison  (hide spoiler)]....).♦ 
Some serious spoilers about Nico: (view spoiler)[He loves Percy - so what?
the last scene of the book was so sweet and sad and then it was like "Percy and Annabeth fall into Tartarus.
She should come and help Percy and Annabeth open the doors from the inside because seriously, how can just the two of them open the doors from the in Tartarus where it's very very very very very dangerous, much more dangerous than the outside, if it takes like 10 people to open them from the outside?!?!
I mean she's practically not Annabeth without her dagger and hat!-Rick Riordan will end on another, worse, cliff hanger.
because Mr. Riordan enjoys torturing his fans with awful cliffhanger endings and then making us wait a whole year before he resolves them.
Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, and the quest and all, blah blah blah..So, it'll only make sense if The House of Hades starts with Nicos point of view.
I'm happy.And I think the cover is probably going to show either Nico being all in command and stuff lookin for the Doors of Death, or Annabeth and Percy running from a bunch of monsters in Tartarus.
What if when Percy and Annabeth make it to the Doors of Death, and Nico and the others are there..
I gobbled it up, like any other Percy Jackson related book.
Predictions ( as of October 4, 2012)1- Percy and Annabeth will live, but they will come out worse for wear.
Not to say Percy hasn't had his share of horrifying experiences, but Nico literally LIVES WITH THE DEAD.
If he is shattered by what he saw in Tartarus, I can't imagine what Percy and Annabeth will be going through.
They will probally get, like a chapter, and it will show Annabeth succumbing to the horrors of Tartarus and Percy panicking or something like that.
There is still a book left, but there is still Gaea herself to fight.
I guess they aren't really fillers but sometimes there were some that weren't really needed hahahaha -Just like the other people, Nico's revelation was a huge thing for me.
I didn't feel the excitement in this book, the humor, the comedy, and that just makes me sad!-Idk if its just me but everyone has a personality except for Jason and Piper.
Also I feel like Percy is so far away ...
probably because I was used to his POVs in the past books.
DEAR RICK RIORDAN, PLEASE GIVE ME A NICO DI ANGELO POV.

FINALLY GET TO READ BLOOD OF OLYMPUS, WHICH I'VE OWNED FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW WOWZERS.My rating system: (I do use half stars.)5 - I do not use the 5 star.
Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.4 - I loved it!
There weren't too many flaws, and I had no trouble getting through it.
You know that feeling when you just finish a book and you want to open it and read it all over again, just to experience it over?
Going into this book I had a lot of expectations, and I was pretty much a mixture of anxiety, fear, and excitement.
They each have a lot of twists and turns as far as their personalities go and I feel like they both really grew in this book.
I can't say much more than that without spoiling something and since a lot of people I know don't have this book yet, I don't want to spoil anything.
Fans of Rick Riordan should read this book.
EDIT: 12/10/13SO I finished this in one night.My brain feels deep-fried.I do not trust myself to write a review in this condition.So my review shall come up after a second reading.BUT GUYS SERIOUSLY(view spoiler)[NICO LIKES DUDESPERCY AND ANNABETH HAD LEGIT NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES THAT ACTUALLY SCARED THE WITS OUT OF MELEO IS IN LOVE WITH CALYPSO (hide spoiler)]RICK THE PLOT TWISTER I SWEAR GOD EDIT: 6/18/13READING THE SNEAK.Holy.

HOW CAN YOU LEAVE US WHICH SUCH A LIFE CONSUMING CLIFFHANGER, RICK!?
I HATE YOU.No actually, I love you.
January 2013 would be lovely!
:)EDIT:Leo is not dying.
Finally a little deviation from Riordan's usual game plans. I enjoyed book 4 more than the first three - ironically the Tartarus storyline felt like a breath of fresh air. There was no quest or short deadline or prophecy dictating the plot sequence in The House of Hades.Besides, we had lots of bad jokes! My weakness! "As for Jason Grace..." Khione's brown eyes gleamed. ".... Jason will grace my throne room."  *chokes on drink* While Leo's falling to his death: At least nobody's around, Leo thoug

My weakness!
"As for Jason Grace..." Khione's brown eyes gleamed.
Jason will grace my throne room."
*chokes on drink* While Leo's falling to his death: At least nobody's around, Leo thought bitterly, or I'd be a demigod joke forever.
*drink goes out nose*
I just loved it.
I think this may be my favourite one so far! I loved the nonstop action and I really liked all of the character development individually and also in the relationships of all the characters. I feel like things are finally starting to make sense.
Creo que de todos los libros de esta serie, este es el que mas me ha llegado al corazón por el lado del amor entre los personajes. Las aventuras, las batallas, la mitología, las risas, la tensión y las lagrimas; estuvieron presentes como en todos los libros de Rick. Ya solo me falta un libro para terminar esta saga y tengo muchos sentimientos encontrados, no me quiero despedir de estos personajes, no me siento preparada para dejar de leer a Percy.Reseña Completa: http://bastvilard.blogspot.com/2015/0...
