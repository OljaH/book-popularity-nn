i loved this so much! i'm already so attached to the main character.

This manga is about a normal boy "Kaneki" that had an organ transplantation from a "Ghoul"..
then he finds that he can't act normal as he was.
He became a "ghoul" after the operation!!He finds many difficulties in his life, he can't accept himself as a ghoul.
He can't eat any normal food anymore!
But he don't want to harm any human.
He don't want to eat humans!
Wow
This is probably THE most amazing manga of the century. Inspired by Takatsuki Sen's "Egg of the Black Goat," it shows the mental and physical progress of a once innocent boy into something much darker but still retaining some of the gentleness of his former self. The literary analogies and intriguing plotline and battles scenes come together to make this one of the most eloquent action mangas to ever exist. There are deep underlying meanings in this manga that can interest any level of reader. I highly recommend this compelling manga!
Chapter 1 to Chapter 9 »»» My Reactions ««« ★★★✩✩
Must be getting old… It’s a zombie world now, so our shy, angst-ridden protagonist falls for - you guessed it - a sexy, well-adjusted, dolled-up ghoul...
I personally liked the story better when told by the Cramps:Oh when the sun goes down and the moon comes upI turn into a teenage goo-goo muckYeah I cruise through the city and I roam the streetsLooking for something that is nice to eatYou better duck, when I show up, the goo-goo muck.I'm a night headhunter looking for some headWith a way-out body underneath that headYeah I'll get you baby with a little luckCuz I'm a teenage tiger and a goo-goo muckYou better duck, when I show up, the goo-goo muck.Yeah the city is a jungle and I'm a beastI'm a teenage tiger looking for a feastYeah I want the most but I'll take the leastCuz I'm a goo-goo muck tiger and a teenage beastYou better duck, when I show up, the goo-goo muck.
I definitely see why so many people like this manga!I liked the MC, though I wanted to punch some sense into him sometimes and tell him to stop crying and do something with his life . . . but then again, the guy just became something he thinks as a ‘monster’ so I can understand why it's so hard for him to be at peace with himself.I'm pretty excited to read the next volumes!3.75
I used to be so in love with books and reading, but I slowly stopped wanting to do so much as pick up a book.
Along the way, I realised that all this time I’ve been developing other interests and changing in general.
I still love reading, but I’ve come to love other stuff also.I looked for a manga to ease my way back.
I felt like it was occasionally hard to tell what was going on from panel to panel, but that could have just been because I hadn’t read a manga in ages.
Great start to a series. Even though I already knew what was going to happen ('cause I've seen the anime) it was still really interesting to read. The art style kind of reminded me of art style of Attack on Titan, but to me, that was a good thing, because I love AoT's art style. Can't wait to continue on with the series and see where the story will go.
This horror manga is not about this tv program.It is also not about this Ace of Base song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ootIy...It also has nothing to do with David Bowie's "China Girl."It is a ghoul story, though it is also a girl story, a girl named Rize a shy boy named Kaneki has a crush on.
K. survives the date with Rize, but with surgery, so now he's a half-ghoul.
And because he is part-ghoul, he must consume human flesh to survive.
I read it because my former student said it was her favorite manga horror series.
.أنا لست بطل الرواية أو شيء من هذا القبيل، أنا طالب الجامعي الذي يحب قراءة القصص الذي قد تجده في أي 
this manga is interesting.
a world that humans and Ghouls lives together, even the human's knows there existence.
but they act like they don't even exist the ghouls i mean.
even though the ghouls eat the human flesh.
humans just ignores them.but one day, a kid named kaneke, sorry if i said his name wrong.
this interesting kid, even though he's not that interesting at the beginning.
but when he turns to half ghoul.
thing would turn upside down for him.
it would be hard for him to except his ghoul side.
i won't explain how things turn out this way.
Or: I absolutely adored the anime when I watched it, and since I needed more of this amazing universe in my life while waiting for the next season, I moved on to the manga.
Things that prove that Kaneki Ken is totally my soulmate:• He is a giant book nerd that spends his whole time reading obscure books and generally avoiding people.• His friend Hide, about Kaneki: "You're so skinny, and all you do is read incomprehensible books!" (Same, Kaneki...
• He's a fairly nice guy, but goes batshit whenever someone dares to lay a finger on his friends.
It's one of my favorite anime, and it's the first manga I've read in a long time.
So far, I’m enjoying this more than i enjoyed the anime, but still 😕...maybe it’s just a little too creepy, even for me.

But… if, for argument’s sake, you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be… a tragedy.-Kaneki Ken, Ch 1 This is the story of an average college guy, who finds himself attacked by a ghoul, creatures with supernatural strength, speed and abilities and who only eat human flesh.

This is the story of an average college guy, who finds himself attacked by a ghoul, creatures with supernatural strength, speed and abilities and who only eat human flesh.
As fate has it, our guy Kaneki ends up in a hospital with the organs of one of these ghouls transplanted in him.
Anyway, its still a great manga, just not a 5-star.The plot in one sense is very mainstream.
Like eating human flesh, for example.
I know she is a ghoul who is hunted by humans and life is difficult and she is young.
Too bad.I really like the name of this series.
3,5 Sterne für den Tokyo Ghoul von mirDa ich keine Vergleichswerte vorweisen kann, ist meine Rezi wohl seeeeehr subjektiv und laienhaft, sorry dafür.
Es passiert storymäßig halt eher wenig, aber das könnte auch daran liegen, dass es der Einführungsband war.Aber ich habe eindeutig gefallen am Thema gefunden und auch von Mangas an sich bin ich nicht mehr abgeneigt.Es ließ sich schrecklich schnell lesen, daher werde ich eindeutig auch noch dem zweiten Band ein Chance geben, weil ich schon wissen will wohin sich die Geschichte entwickeln wird, da viele ja diesen Manga sehr hypen sind meine Erwartungen vielleicht auch einfach etwas hoch gewesen...Zusammengefasst macht Band 1 aber eindeutig Lust auf mehr!
Tokyo Ghoul is coming out with an English edition?!FINALLY!!!!!!Wait...It's coming out in June of next year?!?!AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! THAT'S EVEN LONGER THAN THE SEASON 2 RELEASE DATE!!!!!!!I'll go insane...
Dopo la mia dipartita nel 2010 e l'allontanamento per 6-7 anni dal mondo dei manga tradotti in italiano, Tokyo Ghoul è stato un pò una scommessa.
Lo so lo so non sarebbe male e molti gioiscono al fatto ma come odio gli orrori di traduzione nei libri la stessa cosa vale per anime, film e serie tv.
Errori da elementari (non ricordo il nome del manga) o traduzione dei furigana tra parentasi (DanMachi) o come ultimo esempio edizioni impossibili da tenere in mano (.hack//sign).Ora dopo tutto questo penso che posso dare cinque stelle a questo primo volume.
I don't remember it well, but I think this entire volume happened in episode 1 and perhaps 2 as well.It's really interesting to see Kaneki and the parallels between him and the books he read.
Also Nishiki seems more evil here than I remember him.
Hide is precious, he needs to be protected forever!I hope that by reading the manga I get a deeper understanding of Kaneki and his reasons, but I'm expecting things to start shifting from the anime only around the second season and the volume that corresponds to it.So far so good!
A great start that isn't boring in any way!
you may not be a ghoul, but you're not a human either. there's no place for someone who can't decide between being one or the other. And so the misery begins. I watched the first season and ... Have been ... avoiding season two. Because I know. I know.I don't want to go through that pain.So naturally I start the manga.
A bookstore date... isn't that every book-lover's dream?___Although I watched the anime before, I enjoy this manga so much. I just picked it up to have a look at something and I accidentally read the whole thing— oops.
My friend has brought this book to school for me today just so I can read it since I watched the anime and honestly I love it and I was able to finish it in one day!!! I had some of many questions I had answered even tho this is the first book which means I need to read more of them to complete my list of questions:) the hunt is on!!!
Intriguing plot and fantastic artwork! I'm looking forward to reading more is this series!
Poi qui su GR una mia vicina lo sta leggendo.
Così leggendo tutti suoi commenti positivi e di altri, per non parlare di mia nipote, bé non ce l’ho fatta più.
Sono andata in fumetteria per altro, ma quando l’ho visto non ho resistito, l’ho comprato e l’ho letto.
E sono stata folgorata.
Kaneki e la sua disperazione mi hanno trafitto il cuore.
Dico solo “a me il prossimo!” Fortuna che ho preso i primi tre volumi 😉poi martedì vado a vedermi il film al cinema 😍.
Un Grazie particolare va a Tsukino e a mia nipote che mi hanno fatto conoscere questo manga.
I binge watched the anime and decided to give the manga a try, and it was a great decision! I love how dark the story is, the drawings are beautiful and detailed, and love Ken Kaneki, I already feel very attatched to this character and his story.
Having watched the anime it was high time I started reading the manga.  How could I ever not enjoy a plot where the main protagonist is a person who loves to read and hates social events? Even though I knew what was going to happen I still  loved  it. It's a great start for an awesome manga! Oh I cannot wait to read more and find out what the hell happens next 'cause I've been told things get messy! Have I already mentioned that it is epic?
Actual Rating: 4.5 Stars!--I've been meaning to either start reading the manga or start watching the anime for a while now, but for whatever reason I kept putting it off. I FINALLY picked this one up and read it!I really like the concept of this story and the content seems to be something that I'll really enjoy if I continue with the series!I just have one question, should I continue by reading the manga or by watching the anime?! I'd love your opinions!
eh işte.
Ormai sono completamente innamorata di questa storia. Dopo aver visto l'anime ho deciso di leggere anche l'opera cartacea e devo dire che ne vale sul serio la pena!
And even though I'm not a horror fan I totally appreciate how this experience comes together.One thing that Sui Ishida does really, really well, even if I am sometimes confused by his art, is craft compelling characters from protagonist Ken Kaneki to his best friend Hide, to Touka a ghoul who reluctantly helps Ken, and finally to Mr. Yoshimura, a mentor ghoul who takes Ken and other ghouls under his wing.
