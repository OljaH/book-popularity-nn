But almost 20 years later, the French philosopher, Rene Girard, produced a theory which has a remarkable congruence with its theme and, I think, provides the best explanation of what Jackson was getting at in The Lottery.Girard argued that our individual desires are never the product of some inner longing but always rather of the imitation of others.
The elimination of this individual is therefore not just necessary for the welfare of the community, but also forms the basis of religious practice in which the role of the scape-goat is transformed into a noble duty.Girard goes even further in his later work to claim that the ritual establishment of the scape-goat is the most primitive form of representation, and consequently of language, that human beings have demonstrated.
This tradition has been going on annually for many years – even the oldest citizen in the town recalls that it had been occurring since before he could remember.Although some people are talking about other nearby towns that no longer have the Lottery, the majority in this village seem to be traditionalists who feel that all kinds of bad things – including crop failures – would occur if they no longer held it.This was all very interesting and then one woman starts to speak out strongly against the process when her husband holds the winning ticket.
A classic of stoic, gothic horror yet with a twist that leaves the reader thinking. Like any great short story, this demonstrates the power of that medium by brutal efficiency. Subtle, but the Lottery also reveals Jackson's talent for characterization.A chilling allegory: there is value in tradition but beware blind faith.

OK, so when I chose to read this story I knew it was going to be 1984 level. I expected something twisted and sick. But I was surprised by how twisted and sick it really was. I’m not going to talk about characters or style, these things don’t matter. Anyone with some talent could have written it (even though I loved how normal it all seemed until the end, it fooled me big time). Nah, it’s only about the the message. And for the message alone it deserves 5 stars!
Like Ursula Le Guin’s The Ones Who Walked Away from Omelas (which I reviewed HERE), it opens idyllically:“The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green.
And like Omelas, there is vague foreshadowing of some darker taboo, universally known, but reluctantly accepted.
We like to think we’re good people, who would only do cruel things in extremis, when there is no alternative.
See also Kafka's short story, In the Penal Colony, which I reviewed HERE.
The story describes a fictional small town which observes an annual ritual known as "the lottery".عنوانها: قرعه کشی؛ بخت آزمایی، لاتاری، نویسنده: شرلی جکسون، تاریخ نخستین خوانش: بیست و پنجم ماه جولای سال 2015 میلادیعنوان: قرعه کشی؛ نویسنده: شرلی جکسون، مترجم: احمد گلشیری؛ در 15 صعنوان : بخت آزمایی، ترجمه و نقد: فاطمه فولادی و مریم خردمند، گلستانه، 1388عنوان : لاتاری، ترجمه: فرزاد ابرقویی، تهران، غنچه، 1393، در 17 ص، شابک: 9786007721056؛لاتاری داستان دهکده‌ ای است، که هر سال در روز بیست و هفم از ماه ژوئن، مردمان دهکده، دور هم گرد آمده، و آیین قربانی کردن کسی را انجام می‌دهند.
How do you rate something that keeps you from sleeping?I know that I thought it was brilliantly done; Jackson set the tone so well.
It's a beautiful sunny day and the whole town is gathering, like for a town picnic.
When I did I was horrified.It made me uncomfortable, gave me a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I didn't sleep well for days afterward.
It was powerful, it was terrifying, but I'm not sure whether I liked it or not.(And I can't believe they have kids read this story in high school).
Perturbador, siniestro, genial.
"It isn't fair"Brilliant. While reading this I wondered if this little short piece of works was the inspiration for the Hunger Games and I see that I am not alone in this thinking as other reviewers have said the same thing as well. For such a short story she sure packed in the suspense and feeling of dread. The anxiety of having to draw and be the one with the black dot on your paper.
This seemingly innocuous short story wafted into my consciousness with a halcyon pastoral scene; an English village on a summer's day, suffused with the scent of blossoming flowers and fresh-cut grass.
I could almost taste the cucumber sandwiches and the jam scones.But there is a deeper level to the seemingly twee storyline.
An allegory stealthily unfolds that immediately put me in mind of The Lord of the Flies.Shirley Jackson's fictitious village, like the island in William Golding's book, seems to serve as a microcosm of life.Her prose is crisp; the piece is very well written and (view spoiler)[I didn't anticipate the dystopian-style ending (hide spoiler)].
Really hackneyed dystopian story that has been written a thousand times.
(view spoiler)[All it is, is the annual sacrifice to the gods of whoever the village, the religion, the political regime, worships.
In this sort of story, men are very rarely the victims.
In real life as in stories, it was usually a virgin required.
But then villages, religions and political regimes are usually devised, set up and run by men for their benefit.
Having a few women at the top doesn't negate who the real beneficiaries are.
(hide spoiler)]So the story is chilling ,yes, but only in a gust of a cold breeze kind of way.
راجع به ترجمه ی احمد گلشیری، هر چی بگم کم گفتم.
به نظرم یکی از بهترین مترجم های حال حاضره.اما تمام این ها ربطی به داستان نداشت.راجع به داستان هر چی بگم، لو میره و تمام زیباییش از بین میره.
صفحات داستان خیلی زیاد نیست و فقط ده دوازده صفحه است و در عرض ده دقیقه می تونید بخونید، ولی لذتش، تا مدت ها باقی میمونه.
فقط توصیه میکنم قبلش مقدمه ی داستان رو نخونید.
همچنین هیچ ریویویی رو نخونید، مطلقا، و حتی کامنت های همین ریویو هم تا حدّی لو دهنده ن.از اینجا میتونید داستان رو دانلود کنید:دانلود "لاتاری" از کتابناک

Unfortunately, I also came across spoilers for what the story is about, so it's impact was somewhow lessened.Thus, I will not review it here, hoping some other reader might still come with a fresh mind to it.I will only mention it is worth reading, it shows the author's distinctive touch of evil in the most ordinary places, and reveals unpleasant truths about our mob mentality and our readiness to embrace dangerous ideas.
Considering the story was written shortly after World War Two, its relevance and the accuracy of Jackson's insights have not been exaggerated.
This story made me think of two things.1. Baby wipes can be used in more situations than I thought **wink wink**. No, but seriously, the ending made me spit my coffee. I love it but it is f**ked up. And wrong. And stupid, but fitting as hell. And I still love it. Shirley Jackson is a genius!2. That Lady Gaga Judas video. Now, anyone who hasn’t read this will ask the most obvious question: WHY? But I can’t answer without spoiling the entire thing. Well, actually I can, here it is: (view spoiler)[

If lotteries are supposed to be so fair, why don't they ever feel that way?I just re-read this story as it is the first one in the Brave New Worlds collection.
Knowing exactly what's going to happen gives reading this an additional dimension of eeriness, so I'd definitely recommend reading and coming back to this one at a later date.
An interesting idea, used and built upon by at least one contemporary YA author I happen to have read recently, that made sure that (hide spoiler)] this little story is a quick and pleasurable read, packing an enormous punch!
I read this story years ago in my literature class. The village scenes lulled me. The ending shocked me. I still remember it all these years later. The only other story to remain in my memories so strongly is The Yellow Wallpaper.

I found out about this book from Annamaria's book video. She gave no spoilers away, but I thought I knew what The Lottery was going to be about and I wanted to read it.If you read The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, you, too, know what this book is about, although The Lottery was published a few years before Ursula K. Le Guin's book.That is one question you   do not   want this book to give you an answer to. There is one town where there's an annual lottery and all the people have to take part (

I was going to ask how would anybody let tradition transform them into a monster, but I remembered that there are still such monsters among us.Having read The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas and Ponies, now I am accustomed (it's horrible I'm using this word) to stories like these, and I can give The Lottery more than 2 or 3 stars and not place it on my least favourite shelf.You can listen to this story here.
I should thank my high school lit teacher for making us read this story and scaring the shit out of us back then.
I still read this from time to time and I've recommended it to a bunch of friends and it still manages to creep the hell out of me.
And while there had been many other stories with similar premise (sort of) since then, The Lottery still stands as one of the yardstick in this genre.
It's only about 30 pages long but the story itself is rich in symbolism, proving that less is more.
I highly recommend this story.
Shirley Jackson's classic short story The Lottery is perhaps the basis for The Hunger Games, which is hardly a favorite of mine. Jackson use of prose has me at the edge of my seat and has be eagerly awaiting the ending. The use of language merits a 5 but for me the story is grotesque so the whole story earns a 3. I can see here, however, why Jackson is highly regarded as an author, but her stories are most definitely not my taste.
Fortunato chi (non) vincerà Cosa contraddistingue la Jackson da altri autori del genere horror?Sempl
It would make my list of the best short stories ever written."The Lottery" opens in a village in late June, and the 300 citizens are assembling in the town square.
We learn that the lottery has something to do with a good harvest, but the true meaning of the paper isn't revealed until the last page -- and woe to anyone who would spoil it for a reader who has not had the experience of seeing it unfold for themselves.The story was first published in 1948, and is considered to be an American classic.
My next Halloween read that for years I wanted to get to. A decent read but I wanted more. Why was there even a lottery? I can see where Jackson was going with this one, and I enjoy her stories, but it just left me wishing she elaborated. I believe this one heavily influenced The Hunger Games, which was also influenced by the movie Battle Royale (especially vicious). An OK read, but I much prefer her We Have Always Lived in the Castle.
Well that was a bit of a mindfuck!
I asked on Facebook for horror recommendations and Geri rec'd me this one.
Geri, I'll be sending you the bill for my new therapy sessions after this!
Jkjk.The Lottery starts out innocently, in fact if I hadn't known it was a horror/spooky story I never would have suspected it would go where it did.
Considering this is only a few pages it's one of the best written short stories I've ever read.
I have got to read more by this author.Are you intrigued?
I DARE you to read this.
TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU!
"The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green." But how can the faces of the villagers be so forlorn and grim on such a beautiful day!?I HAD come to know towards the fag end of last year only that Shirley Jackson writes tales of terror.
So when I started reading "The Lottery" today, I was glad that she wrote uplifting stories too.Luck of the draw: Shirley Jackson There is this village where a lottery is held each year.
This is my eighth (I think?) Review Month review.****************************************I'm not going into this plot much. I'll just say that it concerns a ritual that a village performs every year to bring in good crops. The ending is shocking.I'll sum it up with this Bad Luck Brian meme:
I want to like her stories, and I get all "Yay!
I'm going to just LOVE this one because THIS is the story that people think of when they think of Shirley Jackson!"...
The climax was just kind of "...andthenthishappenedtheend." It needed more oomph.
Shirley Jackson is the Master, excuse me, Mistress of the Psychological Whammy.
*eyeroll* She may be called the Mistress of the Psychological Whammy, but I've yet to actually GET that from her stories.
I just don't get why Shirley Jackson's stories are so revered.
Maybe I'm just doing it wrong and not analyzing them enough.
Maybe that's it.
Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.This is the second time I've read this story and, again, it scared the crap out of me. Without a doubt, my favorite short story.
