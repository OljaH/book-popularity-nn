Perry Mason was about to sue the store for damages and slander, but a timely appearance of the woman’s niece settled the matter as she bought whatever her aunt lifted wholesale – spending her last money I might add.
It was Mason’s duty to protect the family from a theft accusation, but the moment he became too nosy and stumbled – literally - upon a dead body he had to do what he is the best at: protecting his clients from a murder charge.The usual case of Perry Mason involves just one dead body, but this time it was an exception as there were more.
Sure enough, a store detective soon appears and begins bullying the poor old woman, whose name is Sarah Breel.
Perry intervenes and the issue is settled, but almost as soon as he is back in his office, he's contacted by Breel's niece, Virginia Trent, a nervous young woman who is studying psychology.
In particular, she's afraid that her aunt has stolen several very valuable diamonds that were left in the possession of Virginia's uncle, a jeweler.Perry discounts the young woman's notion that her aunt has suddenly developed deep psychological problems but sure enough, the diamonds are missing.
A good mystery.
Again, although I did suspect half of the solution (1 of the culprits), I was astounded by the entire manner in which the crime was done.
At places, in the court scene, I kept re-reading the really confusing portions and couldn't help but wonder: This is fiction.
I am just reading it.
Nothing at stake.
What if it was real?
So confusing!!Thankfully it IS fiction.Among all the Perry Mason books that I have read, this was the most philosophical.
Long paras talking about the more heavier concerns of us, homo sapiens.
Still, liked it.PS: LOVED the last line (wink wink!)
After lunch, Perry and Della muse on the strange behavior of the aunt, who certainly didn't seem to be the shoplifter type, though she clearly intended to do so.That would seem to be the end of it, but no, that afternoon Virginia comes to Mason's office and tells an unusual story.
Virginia is worried because Mrs. Bedford just phoned her to return the diamonds early, and now Aunt Sarah has disappeared too!
Aunt Sarah goes on trial for the murder of Austin Cullens and Perry defends her.All of this is well written and intriguing.
Tapahtumat lähtevät heti vauhdikkaasti käyntiin, kun vanhahko hajamielinen eukko jää kiinni myymälävarkaudesta epäiltynä.
Eipä aikaakaan kun eukko joutuu yliajon uhriksi ja silminäkijöiden mukaan käsilaukusta luiskahtaa ajoradalle pistooli.
Alkaa mutkikas tapahtumaketju, joka johtaa niin ovelaan loppuratkaisuun, että sitä joutuu vielä kertaalleen pohtimaan uudelleen kirjan luettuaan.

THE CASE OF THE SHOPLIFTER’S SHOE.
Erle Stanley Gardner.
****.Perry Mason has lunch with an elderly woman who has just been shoplifting in a department store.
He manages to get her off, but next meets her after she has been hit by a car.
It was discovered that she had just come out of a house where a man had been shot dead.
Unfortunately, the woman doesn’t remember a thing.
Perry now has a new client.
In the course of her defensive we encounter another bag of tricks by Mason and his associates in the courtroom.
The most interesting parts of this case were the first chapter where Perry Mason watches an old woman shoplift, and the resolution of the case which surprised me.
There were some weird events that occurred in this book that I don't know are due to changing laws or changing because Gardner was trying to make things more exciting.
Second, the police sequester away the accused and deny her the right to see her lawyer even though she has said she wants her lawyer present, until Perry Mason forces himself into the room.
That seems to be pretty standard in these Perry Mason books, and to my modern mind it seems wrong.
I loved the ending of this one! I think this story had a better development then the rest and a few random parts which I felt the author just added in to add volume. The ending was really good and it showed me how Perry Mason could argue over something he could not prove. Then again, there were so many guesses in this entire story.
Mason was representing two clients, he made the jury think in the first case that his other client had committed the murder, while giving his second client an iron-clad alibi...and thus getting both of them off the hook.
As far as Perry Mason goes, this story got a little out of legal bounds. Perry slightly disappointed me with his wily ways in this one. Also my copy is from 1965 and has a pretty cool retro cover. It made me look 'interesting' on the plane.
Good mystery, although all the switcheroo with the guns was confusing.
I'm reading this series in order and this is easily the best so far.
The writing is a lot better, to begin with.
And finally the women are not all beautiful.
Aunt Sarah Breel is a new kind of Gardner character, calm and gracious, and a very likable one.
The amorous overtones between Perry Mason and Della Street are diminished and almost absent, again, finally.
Perry is finally less of a contentious and overbearing jerk outside the courtroom.The plot is complex but it is not only possible to follow it, but even to guess at least some parts of how everything happened.
Gardner transports the reader back to 1940s and 1950s California. In addition, the cast of characters—Perry Mason, Della Sreet, and Paul Drake never disappoint. This title is above average. It features a strong middle-aged woman who handles things her way in spite of Perry. Plenty of action and good clues. I read and reread them all, especially on free Kindle Unlimited, but this would be a good choice to read first if you are new to Gardener’s work.
This book told a decent mystery, but the end was confusing.
good Perry Mason; Solves 2 murders
Always the best. Mason, once again, the attorney everyone wants on their side. The plot keeps us guessing and engaged. Everyone, including the reader is a winner in the end.
I will always love Perry Mason but I get a kick out of his early books.
(Didn't you just love Asta?)Anyway in these early works, Perry Mason is not the staid middle-aged lawyer with the faithful discreet law secretary, Della Street.
He is a snappy dresser and an audacious lawyer and it is intimated that he and Della are more than friends.
You can't beat a library book sale!
Della, two sheets to the wind, all in the interest of a case, of course!"You should know, Chief, that you mustn't be so serious on my birthday.
The trouble with you is you're cold sober." Mason glanced surreptitiously at his wrist watch.
"Well" he said, "it's not an incurable disease."Della Street surveyed him with exaggerated gravity.
"Yes," she said, "it is.
You might hoist a drink or two, but it would run ff your back like water off a duck's stomach."I like Della more with each book.
And wrist watch as two separate words.
Contains spoilersThis book has all the requisite components of a Perry Mason mystery: Perry meets the accused before the crime even occurs, Perry races (more than once) to get ahead of the police - either to be the first on the scene or to hide a suspect, of course the accused is innocent, Della is on hand to help, Perry has a suspenseful trial scene, and sexism and racism pop up at the most unexpected moments to blindside the reader.
Overall very par for the Perry Mason course which to me means interesting cultural details of times past and a decent mystery.
One of the earlier Mason's that I'm having to special order through interlibrary loan.
You would think such a popular author is still on bookshelves, but it's all flooded with Patterson and Balducci et al these days.
Mason witnesses a shoplifting in a department store tearoom (there's an antiquated thing for you,) while he and Della are having a repast while getting out of the rain.
There's always a sleazy "jane" or two floating around that Della puts question marks around.
This particular story has a lot more courtroom action than most of the earlier ones....and I don't think Perry landed a fist one time this story.
#13 in the Perry Mason series.
Perry and secretary Della Street provide a calculated alibi for a suspected shoplifter in this convoluted entry in the long running series.
Fun, quick read.Perry Mason series - After her well-to-do Aunt Sarah is caught shoplifting, Virginia Trent is convinced she needs to seek psychiatric help for kleptomania.
So why does Virginia turn to legal eagle Perry Mason?
Virginia thinks Sarah swiped the stones, but gem dealer Austin Cullens begs to differ.
In fact, he's prepared to forgive and forget--until he is mysteriously murdered and Sarah is caught running from the crime scene.
Good case, lousy title (the shoe doesn't enter into it much). Lots of courtroom yelling, which is fun. Poor judge! The case is normal Gardner (i.e. very complicated). Audio: horrible narration by Alexander Cendese. Yes, there are loads of characters, and he has different voices for each. Good. But most of them sound like cartoon characters. One came across as a parody of Marlon Brando's the Godfather. And why in the name of the gods does he make Della Street sound like a spastic chipmunk on helium?
A below-par Mason mystery that does not challenge the reader. One of the biggest flaw of the books is that the defendant is frail old lady around robbers, gamblers and adulterers. So, you never once get convinced the case has any merit and are surprised that there is even a case. The police unwittingly play into the hands of Mason with botched up work. Overall a lazy book. And a pointless title too. (That incidentally take me one step closer to the dream of reading all Perry Mason books)
I always get a kick out of the way Perry Mason outsmarts/outmaneuvers the cops and the D.A. Shocking though (in this book) that Perry has to con his way into talking to his client before the police grill her. (This was befire Miranda rights.) Unimaginable in this day that cops would try to squirrel away and browbeat the suspect and keep her from her lawyers. In any case I ALWAYS enjoy Perry Mason books.
This is definitely not one of the best. In addition to some 1930s-style non-PC epithets, the story isn't up to par. Perry's tough cross-examination of the detective and the coroner gets his client off as well as the person who did shoot the decedent, but it was kind of smarmy.
Vintage mystery!
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I liked it. you could visualise the characters because of the T.V. series.
Good read. So far I've read the first 13 books in order. Gardner continues to progress as a writer. Can't wait to read #14
Perry went to a jury, got his client off, and didn't lead the cops to the murderer.
