One of my favorite textbooks out there.
An excellent textbook for STUDY not REVIEW.
This is not the book to read two days before an examination.
It is far too in depth for that.
Where Review Of Medical Physiology explains a topic in two pages - Guyton and Hall explain it in twenty.This is the book to use DURING the course to gain a THOROUGH understanding.
When end of course examinations come around, you can look back to check on stuff.
But another text might be more apt.
Expect to do a lot of highlighting in order to filter out extraneous material.
Other than that - an excellent book!
I have this book for three good years now. I know it is the greatest book in the field of Physiology, wouldn't argue that. My problem with it is that of size and how it is really written.You can't know which is essential and important in a specific subject and the way the mechanisms presented is sophisticated and memory-intensive which make it hard to grasp the concept.In my third year I bought the pocket version, it's better and quit sufficient. But then I discovered Linda S. Costanzo!
This is the best physiology book I have used, IPersonally love physiology and this book is just great
Just for fun 😂🤧
فقط بخش قلبو خوندم
this book very helpfull for medical student, whoever they occupation as doctor or scientist. this one, make me easier to understand phisiology. beacuse its general, you can use it to animal and human. oh, I forgot to say it's easy understanding.
Well...I haven't really ever used this textbook more than once. To me it feels unapproachable. Small text? Dense writing? Layout? Not sure. I ended up bringing down an old second hand pathophysiology textbook because I can totally jump right into it.
If you keep up a starvation regime for significant time, you train your body to be very still—to conserve every calorie.It is essential, when losing weight, to vigorously work all your muscles every day.
Now you’ve trained your body not to twitch, you burn very few calories.
Now you’ve lost the habit of regular physical activity, you’re eating again finally, you gain fat.Satiety is another casualty of following medical advice.
Your body is very good at matching how much it tells you it needs to eat, to how much energy you burn—over a wide range of levels of activity.
arguably most complete book of physiology . if you have this book in hands you don't need a teacher notes or other helpful material, Guyton(this book) alone is enough . everything is explained in most possible details on undergraduate level. the only problem you face is reviewing this book for exam. although during studying one of its sentence "although the exact cause is unknown but few possible explanations are " was very irritating
Fizyoloji icin temelden baslayarak herseyi oldukca basitten baslatan bir anlatimi var, fakat Profesor Edremitoglu'nun derslerine yetisemiyor :)
Sem dúvida é um excelente livro, todo bom estudante de medicina o lê mais de uma vez e o tem de cabeceira!
it's too basic, it simplificates everything to a level that is unconvinient for students.

In-Depth Coverage of Advanced PhysiologyIf you are looking for a quick overview for a test, this book is probably not your best bet. However, it is excellent for gaining a profound understanding of physiology for advanced health sciences. If it had more review problems and case studies, I would give it five stars, but as is, it was worth the money for the kindle version (the physical textbook will add considerably to the weight of a backpack).
i came across this book by coincidence while i was looking for some medical textbooks and it reminded me of my 2nd medical year, but that one was 12th edition well, i didn't read it fully because it's exaggeratedly detailed and deep for a 2nd medical student level, but it's definitely a must-read textbook, since the materials will overlap with other courses such as Anatomy, pathology and later on, clinical clerkships !
Amazing cardiovascular, renal and hormonal approach; slightly basic neuroscience section, though very clear and sharp neuronal electrophysiology chapter. 2015 edition devotes half a page to cerebellum's role in learning and that's unacceptable. Works well combined with Kandel's Neural Science if to get a less vapid and more refined scope of Physiology and Neurophysiology as a whole.
Great intro
بيان مفاهميم فيزيولوژيك براي دانشجويان علوم پزشكي به ساده ترين طريق ممكن،كاري است كه آرتور گايتون فيزيولوژيست امريكايي در اين كتاب انجام داده است.
كتاب رائع في الفيزيولوجيا .. موسع واسلوبه جميل
The Best Book on Physiology.
it is a amazing book
Confortante, scorrevole nella lettura
Really thorough, easy to understand. Every time I a concept cleared up for me I would put it down and literally take minute thinking, yessss now I get it. A great teacher!
¡Me encanta! Siempre que tengas una duda puedes recurrir a él y te lo explicará largo y tendido, y fácil de entender. Cierto es que hay temas (pocos y contados) en los que no es tan magnifico así que tendremos que recurrir a otras literaturas. Pero en general, recomendable -yo lo amo. Una gran base para aprender fisiología humana.
Me aniquiló en tercer semestre, pero está genial.
The ideas are usually explained clearly and done so in several ways as many of the concepts are repeated in the same chapter or in different chapters.
That being said, purchase the review book because the questions are great, but that's for a different review.
Someone else said it in an earlier review, but it's worth repeating: read this with a highlighter in hand.
Even though this book was very clear (not concise), YouTube is my new favorite- if you're looking for an explanation or illustration you're probably going to find it on there that explains it a bit different and sometimes makes complex concepts clear.
En realidad es el único libro que estoy pudiendo leer estos días porque me están explotando con exámenes. Ya llegaran vacaciones y leeré todo lo que compre... si, sigo comprando libros torturándome sin saber si voy a poder leerlos pero al menos me aseguro tenerlos. No se si la gente normalmente escribe tanto acá pero por algo te dan tantos caracteres, para sintetizar esta twitter. Y no es ninguna review es solo un comentario para advertirles que no estudien medicina si les gusta leer otras cosas.
The bible of physiology.Even though I kept having doubts while I was reading this book about whether its material can stick to my mind or not. But when I was finished, I found its method to be very effective.Other physiology textbooks tend to make lists, diagrams, & other stuff like that. Although that's good momentarily, but it won't be quite good on the long run.Guyton begins from the basics & has a very amazing perspective on things. It will provide you with the best foundation you can obtain.
Well-written explanations of how every organ system in the body works.The text flows well, and is pleasant to read (well, as pleasant as a physiology textbook could possibly be...)You have manuals for your car, and manuals for your DVD player. Why not have a "manual" for how your own body works? Think about it.
