The White Ship is mostly just description of a mystical voyage on a strange ship with a strange old man, but it is interesting for the fact that it's actually a fantasy and not the typical Lovecraftian horror. A nice departure and an interesting visual trip, but not a terribly exciting story.
First published in The United Amateur (November 1919), “The White Ship” is the earliest example of Lovecraft’s Dunsanian dream fantasies, the most accomplished and developed of which is The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath.In this story, lighthouse keeper Basil Elton dreams of a white ship that carries him to various marvelous cities, the narrative ends with the lighthouse keeper’s rude awakening.
Here’s an excerpt, to give you a good example of Lovecraft’s early style (and the closest “The White Ship” gets to an interesting allegory):
And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: “This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.”
A man tells tale of his times in faraway dream lands and his many wondrous experiences.This is more of a wistful fantasy tale than a horror one and influenced by Dunsany. OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
A dream cycle story featuring a curious lighthouse keeper Basil Elton who boards the white ship with an unnamed bearded man. It takes him far away to the Dreamlands where nobody ages. His curiosity makes him restless and he starts another journey against the bearded man's warnings. The ship takes him back to where he boarded moments earlier only to find that his lighthouse beacon failed the first time in history.
First published in 1919, this is the second story in Lovecraft's Dream Cycle.
It tells the tale of Basil Elton, a lighthouse keeper who speaks of "the secret lore of ocean." When the moon is full, he witnesses a White Ship which "glides smoothly and silently across the sea".
Together, they explore a group of mystical islands ending in a search for Cathuria, the Land of Hope.This is a dream-like short story which explores themes of loneliness, yearning, exploration, fantasy and danger.
There are moments of darkness in here, but the atmosphere is closer to a fantasy tale.
If you like The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath, then you'll probably dig this story. If you didn't like Kadath, then you probably won't get into this one either. More fantasy than horror, more dream than terror. If that's your bag then give it a read.
It's odd that The White Ship, currently one of my favorite pieces from Lovecraft, does not fully adopt the Lovecraftian style of writing. Nonetheless the level of atmospheric mastery, beauty, and (for lack of better description) humanity in this story is undeniable.
I listened to this story and am currently going through the other six stories on an audiobook on youtube. I like this story because it's lucid and dreamlike and unexpected. I only wish the story could've gone on longer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZSho...
My first Lovecraft story, and I loved it! I definitely see some similarities in the writing of contemporary authors Stephen King, Clive Barker, and even C.S. Lewis. I'm excited to dig into more of his writing!
Min lilla "utbildning" i H.P. Lovecraft går mot sitt slut och Det vita skeppet är den sista av novellerna som jag hade den stora glädjen att få. Läs mer på min blogg
Not much for a horror story but such a beautiful description of a sailor's eye-view on the nature and its environment. Magnificent.
Se ve de pronto en un viaje onírico por unos parajes etéreos.
Junto a un viejo de barba blanca, y siguiendo a un pájaro azul, pasan por la isla de los sueños, misterios, placeres, hasta llegar a descansar a la tierra de la imaginación.Luego de haber encontrado la tierra perfecta, el héroe quiso ir donde nadie había ido, osea, a la Tierra de la Fantasía, el cual era un viaje sin retorno.La Imaginación es la imagen creada de la fantasía.
No solo le bastó disfrutar la imagen, quiso ir donde nacía todo, hacia los Dioses.
I've been into Lovecraft for a while but just recently got into the work of Lord Dunsany. This reads more like a Dunsany tale than a Lovecraft tale but that doesn't hinder me from loving this story. If Dunsany had written this it would also be my favorite of his work, but it just so happens Lovecraft wrote it. Surely out of pure admiration and inspiration for Dunsany and theres nothing wrong with that.
You'd think that this would be a horror story, given that it's by Lovecraft, but surprisingly, it's not. Apparently he wrote a series of related "Dream Sequence" stories that are related mainly because the main plot point involves dreams. This is one of these, and I really liked it. It had touches of Dunsany and (of course) Poe and really succeeded in blending those together.
Enjoyable for the mystical descriptions of fantasy lands encounter on the voyage of a mysterious ship. The imagery and dreamlike sense of adventure is reminiscent to the Chronicles of Narnia in some aspects.
super intersting

Безіл Елтон - наглядач маяка в третьому поколінні. Раніше багато суден пропливало біля маяка, але тепер їх можна помітити лише інколи. Час від часу під повним місяцем припливає Білий Вітрильник. Однієї такої ночі Безіл спускається на його палубу по місячним променям. Білий Вітрильник пропливає повз край мрій, край див, край недосяжних задоволень і припливає до Сона-Нил, де немає страждання і смерті. Там Безіл живе тисячі років, але на думці у нього лише край надій, куди він вмовляє доставити себе капітана Білого Вітрильника.
Mi segundo relato favorito de Lovecraft.
La manera de describir las ciudades del sueño son sublimes, La sensación de misterio que cada una entraña, es inquietante.
Y a la vez hermosa.
Con un final que de deja un vacío, Pero no por que sea malo o le falte algo, si no por la situación.
Creo yo una enseñanza del egoísmo y sus consecuencias.
Hay sueños hermosos que pueden volverse una pesadilla.
Basil Elton aprendió esa lección al navegar en la Nave Blanca, y no conformarse con lo hermoso que ya tenia al estar en el mundo onírico.
¡Un relato que debes de leer!
There is nothing more captivating than the gorgeous, lyrical voice enclosed in the ominous tales of H.P. Lovecraft. He creates for you the most beautiful and terrible places to dream of in your mind's eye, only to snatch them abruptly away, leaving you behind on an empty shoreline to contemplate numerous hidden meanings, and wonder about things bigger than yourself. Absolutely beautiful.
The children of mankind are never satisfied. I actually like this one. It does remind me of something, but what exactly is not coming to me (besides the goose that laid the golden egg). (Moved 2015 review to the individual work Sept. 2017 to make room to review the collection under its own entry.)
A dream of travel through mystical lands, descriptive and fantastic, with no plot. Like much of Lovecraft, the bricks to build a world, rather than a full blown world itself. Short and airy, lacking the usual cosmic horror.
another dunsany impression though tinged with the lovecraft pessimism.
Lovecraft sin finales abiertos es como King sin mencionar Maine. No existe
A delightful dream story.
More like 2.5 stars. Odd one, but I like the motif, even if the story itself was rather bland.
7/10Edición: Narrativa Completa Tomo I
My Rating System:* couldn't finish, ** wouldn't recommend, *** would recommend, **** would read again, ***** have read again.
I didn't care much for this. Some of the description was nice though.
