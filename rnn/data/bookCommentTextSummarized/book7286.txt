If you're not familiar with how Hegel, Nietzsche and Marx are connected and how the ideological hegemony of the bourgeois era needs to be transcended before one can fully grasp the freedom of individual sovereignty and make the social revolution, you may not have a clue about what Bataille is working towards with INNER EXPERIENCE.
My suggestion is to get a shaman to help you navigate a heavy psychedelic experience AFTER reading and fully grasping Marx's VALUE, PRICE AND PROFIT, Hegel's Introduction to THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY and Nietzsche's THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA.
I find that inner experience is a movement toward not a singular experience, but a communal experience situated beyond discourse and any intellectual project.
Bataille is one of the 20th century's most thought provoking thinkers and "Inner Experience" is perhaps one of the most important writings from the interwar period of Europe, being published in 1943.
By and large, "Inner Experience" is a poetic meditation dealing with individual insufficiency.
Through inner experience the individual eventually is effaced and becomes part of the unfolding of time: being is remaining the self in the ocean of life.
History is little more than the myriad activities of religions, empires and states that are ultimately built on channeling / cannibalizing / controlling human interiority. Bataille doesn't want to control inner experience, he wants to set it free.No one, not even Bataille, knows exactly what that means.
Not lucid. But very lucid. Reminded me of Blue of Noon a lot of times throughout the pages. The two books seemed like a verification of each other.
bataille (or maybe the translators introduction, i read the kendall one) says that really the book is built around part 2: torture, being the most essential, with part 4 being sort of an addon and seems to admit parts 1 and 3 are just there so he could have a book to publish.
what inner experience is, Bataille is averse to precisely as he does not like "narrow definitions".
Perhaps the book itself was trying to evoke an inner experience in me.
"leaves an eye, free of the sand, strangely open"
This is a weird, difficult book. I do not know precisely what to think about it, perhaps that being Bataille’s point all along. Reading it is a strong experience, though.

Libro verdaderamente raro, no sólo por la exploración de las emociones interiores que emprende Bataille, sino por lo difícil que es conseguirlo hoy en día, al menos acá en México.
Ahí vemos, desde una óptica subjetiva (es decir, desde experiencias personales y una posterior lectura a la luz de alguna teoría nacida de esa misma experiencia), la función de la felicidad, el éxtasis, la melancolía, el dolor, el tiempo y su influencia en la percepción humana, la fe, entre otras, así como su posterior localización en el mapa de las emociones humanas.
Más que una de esas lecturas que va de principio a fin, un libro para la consulta constante.
This writing is the echoes of a cry.
A cry of anguish, of the human that is bound and binding in its humanity, its thought, its knowledge.
It cries out from the depths of itself, from out of alterity - the cry to the other to sacrifice themselves as well, and so communicate some difference, something subversive that discourse cannot convey.
The passion over the guilt of humanity, the oppression that we are, and that empties us.
An exigency for sacrifice rends us from within, and we cannot but cry out in anguish.
Such, perhaps, is what the inner experience calls one to.Ecce homo.
İç Deney Bataille'nin deyimi ile bir nevi -iç deneyim- elbette.Nietzsche'nin Tanrı öldü nidasına ses vermiş ve bunun üzerinden gitmiş bir felsefecidir Bataille. Bu kitabı yine farklı bir zamanda tekrar okunması gerekenler listesine ekliyorum. Kesinlikle es geçilmemelidir.

暴力和意味着死亡的暴力拥有着双重意义。一方面死亡的恐怖驱使我们远离它,因为我们向往生命;另一方面死亡中隆重而又可怕的因素又使我们感到着迷,让我们感到深深的不安。巴塔耶感兴趣的正是死亡的这种双重性。
