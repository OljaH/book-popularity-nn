THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.What I was expecting to happen when picking up Twisted Palace: What actually happened while reading majority of Twisted Palace: UNTIL the last 15% or so. That was when all the action FINALLY took place. But I am sad to report that the ending may have been even worse than the lackluster build up.I am not exaggerating when I say LITERALLY NOTHING happens until the last 15-20% of the book. (view spoiler)[Unless you want to count Reed and Ella finally doing the dirty. I
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.What I was expecting to happen when picking up Twisted Palace:
(hide spoiler)] Which made me think what was the point of even having a third book?
It was completely rushed and maybe I missed the explanation to how (view spoiler)[Steve was able to get in and out of the penthouse unseen and with no video footage?
Whatever the reason, we should have had a more detailed ending especially considering so many tidbits were mentioned throughout the first two books but they went nowhere and led to nothing.
(hide spoiler)]1 star for Reed because I loved him from the start.
With everything that is going on in this book, the return of Ella's supposedly deceased father, Steve, is barely noteworthy in the big scheme of things.Never have Reed and Ella faced more uncertainty about where their relationship stands, than they do in this book.
While Ella is determined to stand by her man, Steve is hell-bent on keeping her away from Reed.It seems that Ella got settled into her new life with the Royals just in time to be uprooted once again.
As a result, Ella has to sneak around and deceive him to maintain her relationship with Reed.In fact, Steve proved to be a major player in this book.
4 stars!  Twisted Palace is a book I’ve been eagerly anticipating for months. Those of you who have read this series understand me! After the last book, I had my theories, I was a nervous wreck and couldn’t wait to see what was going to happen to my beloved characters. I was more than ready to be ruined once again by these Royals…   This house is ridiculously large, ridiculously beautiful, but everyone inside of it is so messed up. Including me. I guess I really am a Royal.   Ella Harper has onl
After the last book, I had my theories, I was a nervous wreck and couldn’t wait to see what was going to happen to my beloved characters.
I love Reed and Ella’s relationship, but something earth shattering is threatening it.
There is so much going on in Ella and Reed’s life.
I loved him even more in this book.
I love being surprised in a book.
Easton has always been my favorite Royal, but I am so curious about whats going to happen with Gideon, I almost hope he’s next… Twisted Palace is 100% addictive, just like the others in this series.
You are allowed to throw tomatoes my way.Fine, that's enough.That being said, this is probably the most belated ARC review ever written, but you can probably guess what I'm about to say; I devoured Twisted Palace.
I did find some plotlines and scenes far-fetched, I did get angry at Ella a couple of times, but there's something about this series, something about these Royals, that forces me to step aside all reason and enjoy this addictive ride.It's my drug.
Just when Ella finally feels like a Royal, it is taken away from her.
"These Royals will ruin you." I didn’t expect any of this and my brain is in overdrive now. This society, I’m having a difficult time forming coherent words, I mean what in hell, the things that go down in these books are crazy I’m going out of my mind here.The things the protagonist has gone through in her 17 years of life are unbelievable and should never have happened, the things she’s had to do to survive in this harsh society are infuriating and see her put on a brave face in society makes
This society, I’m having a difficult time forming coherent words, I mean what in hell, the things that go down in these books are crazy I’m going out of my mind here.The things the protagonist has gone through in her 17 years of life are unbelievable and should never have happened, the things she’s had to do to survive in this harsh society are infuriating and see her put on a brave face in society makes me want to scream.
The fragile palace of the Royals continues to crumble and fall as Reed faces trial over the death of his father's fiancee, and Steve takes his rightful place as Ella's father.
I love how much Reed changed since meeting Ella, and I believe they became better people thanks to each other.
Some of the characters took a step back to focus more on Reed's case, Ella and Steve's reunion, and the mystery of Brooke's death.
I hope you continue to work together as Erin Watt because I have fallen in love with her books, and I look forward to reading more!
Waiting was not fun.- My least favorite book in the series.- Loved the Royals, East being my favorite.
- All in all, a good read (the last 15% was the best).BUT...- Was bored and unengaged with the first half of the book.- Too many loopholes in the story.- Too many eye-roll moments.- Didn’t love the heroine.- The ending was a bit unbelievable and rushed.Usually when I want a book really bad and have to wait for it, I end up disappointed...
-	An awesome series.-	I regret nothing.-	I’ll read anything these authors write in the future.
thank goodness my life is relatively free of any drama because this book had enough to last me a couple of years. which means i am most likely going to take a break from this series. i feel like i am just too exhausted with all these teenage shenanigans, and this was a decent enough conclusion to everything that has been happening in the last three books, so i feel okay hitting pause. thanks royal boys - its been fun!  3 stars
That ENDING!! October can't come soon enough!
"... All these things are part of what twisted us up inside, but somehow those tangled strands fused until we were whole again."  4.5 Stars!(I buddyread this book with my fabulous sis Bea. Click her name to read her fantastic review.)Talk about one of the most overwhelming twists of the year. Twisted Palace practically made me sit on the edge of my seat. And I never got to sit back.I admit I didn't quite trust this book to stun me the way the previous books of the series did to me. Seeing mixe
The conclusion of this series is truly amazeballs!After a set of cliffhangers in Paper Princess and Broken Prince, we finally get to have a satisfying ending.
I swear that revelation was something that I did not see coming.There are things that stood out in this book including Reed and Ella's romantic and character development.
In this book we finally see a different Reed, one who can definitely control his anger issues.
Twisted Palace was brought out in an epic way and the series, as a whole, was one of the best series I've ever had the privilege of reading.
3.5 STARS  The royals are like the apple in the fairy tale. Golden on the outside, but rotten to the core.  Well...damn. Color me conflicted. I struggled with my rating for two days after finishing it. Because see, the thing is, I'm freaking conflicted! Am I even making sense here? Of course I'm not! Because I'm conflicted I tells ya! Bah. Just bah.To say that I've been anticipating this book as much as a virgin's first orgasm would be an understatement. What? Is that not a saying? Well it shoul
You get what I'm saying here, right?
Ever since I finished Paper Princess, I've been practically foaming at the mouth for this conclusion.
In some small corner of my brain that is now in control, I feel like if I love him hard enough, long enough, I can keep him with me forever.
But if you've read the previous books, this is nothing new.
You get teased for two books and tell me your ovaries don't turn blue.
Quit the battle and just give in, Reed!
Aside from the crazy drama of that ending, I still read it in one sitting.
THE ROYALS ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE AS A FAM!!
The funniest thing is, I don't seem to have unpopular opinions a lot when it comes to books but when I see people liking this series I want to kill someone.
Now, here's the thing, I did only read 6% of the book.
It was the most disturbing and degrading YA book I have read.
I couldn't put myself through the pain that this book would cause because no one should hate themselves this much.Problem here, everyone likes this series.
Even the characters I liked before, I started to feel so disappointed in them.Let me jot down a couple of things that made me so not love the Royals and their stories:The drama just continues and continues...........everything just felt forced and totally not believable!!!Reed Royal...........He just drove me crazy with all his yes, no, maybe I should.........make up your mind!!!And Ella.......what the hell happened to the sassy, take no shit girl............why she took her now alive and appearing father's crap was beyond me!!!!
Oh my goodness... What a crazy ride. I'm ruined by these Royal boys but damn, it was so worth it. I have no regrets, none... I loved this journey sooooo freaking much. :-D Farewell boys, I'm gonna miss each one of you... Oh by the way, maybe I'm gonna miss Ella too,but maybe a little bit... :)Ps. The Royals Series completed now but we will carry on with Easton's book... OMG this will be amazing. I'm so excited to read his story. <3
As we discovered at the end of Broken Prince, Brooke has been murdered and Reed is the prime suspect.
I do think fans of the series will devour this book and many will be happy with the series end.
It felt as if there was no clear path for a lot of the book, and then everything resolved quickly at the end.
But despite that as I said I enjoyed the end and look forward to more from these two authors, I am beyond excited for a possible book about Easton.
Use it freely whenever Orphan stripper or Creepy dad or Douche boyfriend or Creepy step-mother -- oops, sorry, this one is dead already, so you’ll save a couple of tomatoes for someone else – Zombie Papa which rose from the dead in the end of book two if you remember -- appear on the stage.*the lights dim* *creepy music begins* *the curtain opens*Scene 1.
But don’t stop, your tongue is so delicious I may come right this moment.Grinch: Jeez, don’t bite it off from the excitement, girl or it’ll be awkward.Douche boyfriend: I didn’t kill Creepy step-mom, do you believe me?Ex-Orphan stripper: Oh yes, your tongue convinced me that you didn’t.
Also, this series has to be read in order.Ella is a fixture of the Royals, a family member who has finally been accepted, embraced and now deeply loved.
Especially in the end I was expecting a bit of a bonding moment between him and Ella.I have one complaint about a certain person who is a major jerk and so self absorbed that he almost seems naive.
She was awesome and I wish she would get her own story.If you expect major twists you are right to do so.
I also would have loved to see a bit more of the family dynamics of the Royals.

4 Stars!
Ella Harper's life has been one challenge after another.
After moving to Bayview & a complicated start with the Royals, she's come to care about them all.
She can't imagine them not in her life.
When her long lost father returns & Reed finds himself in some trouble, everything Ella holds dear is in jeopardy.
Ella is tough, & will fight for the people she loves.
Ella & Reed suddenly feel like the universe is conspiring to keep them apart.
Reed's life is on the line & his quick temper continues to sabotage him.
By insane I don't mean dark and gritty, I mean this story reached way beyond the normal YA limits and because of that it was shocking.I can't even describe to you the raw emotions that I felt while enjoying this series, so really all I can say is to read it!
I think one of the most shocking things about this series was my own emotions.
Through three books I changed who I liked, who I suspected of things, and who I wanted all to myself.
When I first started with the Royals I honestly didn't think I would like them.
Title: Twisted PalaceSeries: The Royals #3Author: Erin WattRelease date:  October 17, 2016Cliffhanger: NoHEA(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]Ella and Reed's story has been such an unpredictable and thrilling ride.
After the stunning ending to Broken Prince, I was desperately waiting to get my hands on this book to finally get some answers and some closure.
Reed and Ella have struggled to accept, love, and forgive and are finally at a place when they are confident in each other.
Ella Harper is all I’m ever going to see, because she’s my future.
My reactions and ideas are split in 2 main categories, that are easily to distinct:  The love story  Reed and Ella felt real to me.
It might sound a cliche, but Ella changed him with her love and personality.
The Royal Family  I saw a huge difference in the way the Royal's treated each other and Ella, compared to their behavior in the first 2 books.
The way they made Ella one of their own made me loved them even more, especially Easton, and I can't wait to read his book, he won my heart.
Annoying characters  Steve!!
****4 Stars**** “These Royals will ruin you…” “Twisted Palace” is the highly anticipated conclusion to Erin Watts’ “The Royals” series. After Broken Prince finished with such a massive cliffy, I couldn’t wait to get my hand on this one to find out how this addictive series was going to conclude. I was eagerly awaiting to be ruined by these Royals once again.Ella has only been living with the Royals for a short time, but she has really become part of the family and loves them all fiercely. Ella h
I was eagerly awaiting to be ruined by these Royals once again.Ella has only been living with the Royals for a short time, but she has really become part of the family and loves them all fiercely.
She has to decide yet again whether to run as she has always done, or stay and fight and protect the only family she has ever really known (since the death of her Mother) and loved.
The love that Ella and Reed had for each other was powerful and intense; they had to fight to help protect each other and their family.
I would most definitely recommend this book and this whole series on their love story alone.
LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK | B&N | KOBO |LIVE!Book 3 of 3.LIVE! | AMZ US | AMZ UK | B&N | KOBO |Books in The Royals series should be read in order:Book 1: Paper PrincessBook 2: Broken PrinceBook 3: Twisted Palace
The Royals series comes with a WARNING: "These Royals will ruin you..." and it’s especially true if you read the books as they were released.
Because you had to wait a couple months for the next book to come out and the anticipation was high.
I personally loved the cliffhangers because it reminded me of the thrill I had as a kid waiting for my birthday to arrive.
To me, this series is like a telenovela/soap opera.
Book 3 is the conclusion of the story.**Complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.**
***4,25 "Desperate & Angry" stars*** In the first book of the Royals series, there was a quote who was saying.... "These Royals will ruin you!!!" ...And if anybody who had read this series claims that hasn't been ruined by this bunch of guys will be a liar!!!God, this was one of the most addictive stories that i have ever read!!! And now, it's over!!!I'm so happy that i finally had the conclusion of this story but i will miss those Royals!!!! Ella included since she is a Royal in heart!!! “
In the last installment of the Royals, everything had turned upside down!!!!Reed is in a very ugly position and his life is about to get ruined and some unexpected guy made a sudden appearance and he is making Ella's and Reed life even more difficult than before....That's why i was feeling mostly desperate and angry in this book!!!Because as the pages were passing by, the helpless feeling was getting more intense and at the same time, that mysterious guy got so much in my nerves that i wanted to kick his ass!!!

TITLE: Twisted Palace SERIES: (The Royals, #3) AUTHOR: Erin WattGENRE: CONTEMPORARY ROMANCECHAPTERS: 37RELEASE DATE: 17TH October, 2016
Spoken in 'Dual perspectives' Reed & Ella..This also ends right where BOOK#2 ended, Reed in custody being questioned for Brooke Davidson's death, Reed's father’s platinum-blonde, gold-digging girlfriend.
Wow where to even start writing up this review, twists and turns which I kind of knew were coming but didn't wreck my reading experience, it just had me racing through the pages to see if I was right and wondering if Reed was in fact going to be serving time in prison for the murder of the wicked witch of the west.
Again, not sure if 2.5 or 3 stars.These books (meaning the whole trilogy) were ridiculous, the thing is, it doesn't bother me anymore, now it makes me laugh! I had such a good time reading this final installment! I mean, I was still rolling my eyes the whole time, but now I was also laughing (at the ridiculousness of everything), but I had fun! I sure don't know how I feel about this trilogy, but I know I didn't hate the books. I didn't love them either.
The life and times of the rich and the famousWell, this series has shaken up some of my childhood dreams and wishes.
So, my childhood wishes and dreams are gone but at least I can firmly say that I learned my lesson…the grass isn’t always greener on the other side.I started Twisted Palace nervous and excited.
He is finally starting to see the error of his ways and loves that Ella, by his side, has made him a better person.
The ending of Twisted Palace did seem a little rushed but I'm happy with the way the story concluded.
