Which is fine by me - I'd have nothing to say to them anyway." Imagine a world where people could live forever.
Those who have children anyway, are sent to prison - and the kids referred to as Surpuses, sent to live in halls, where they are beaten, starved and trained to become housekeepers.Anna is one such Surplus, she has accepted her lot in life, thoroughly brainwashed by the horrible Ms Pincent.
That is until Peter turns up, a late arrival - Peter has spent much of his life on the Outside, and begins telling Anna of her parents.
But right off the bat I was annoyed by the beginning--a nine-page-long diary entry.
I mean, diary entries CAN be done well, and written in a believable way.
The ones in this book are not.
Other times, the journal entries repeat things that just happened in the story, only with the main character giving her (very immature) opinions on things as well ("stupid" seems to be one of her favorite words).
The diary entries really irritated me.
But they aren't the only parts I found frustrating about this book.
The entire thing just feels really immature and unoriginal to me.
I'm a real lover of dystopian societies, especially those set in a foreseeable future, and this is one unlike any other but with elements that are so cleverly woven with the current thoughts and fears that it makes it seem like a tragic possibility.The book tells the story of a society where longevity drugs mean that the body never grows old and dies, they keep all the organs working and eradicate diseases such as cancer, heart disease and AIDs. But a society where no one dies cannot exist unless no one is born either.Hence the declaration.
In order to take Longevity, people have to sign the Declaration.
The children are referred to as Surplus.Surplus Anna is one of the most promising occupants of Grange Hall, a bleak and cold housing unit for illegal children.
Anna doesn't think much about a life of freedom until Peter shows up at Grange Hall and tells her things that only her parents could know.Together, Anna and Peter set out on an adventure that changes their lives forever.
As appealing as living forever may seem, it is clear the consequences far outweigh the benefits.
So she's been shuffled off to Surplus Hall, where she learns menial housekeeping tasks to earn her keep in the world that doesn't want to support her.This could be a fascinating look at gender politics, overpopulation, medical advancements, or global resources, but it's just ...
Characters' changes of heart happen relatively suddenly, with little to no time given to explain what prompted the change.
This is not to imply there's little explanation overall; long portions are almost nothing but explanation, interrupting the narrative to give the background on the terminology, or the history, or the relationship between several characters.I might still recommend this to some teens, but probably not as a first draft pick.
The writing seems more like a children's book but the content is young adult so that kind of bothered me.
That was pretty much the way the whole book was, 'it's like that because I said its like that' kind of writing.As I said before, it reads like a children's book and if you can accept the story as a child would, without question, then you will probably enjoy it a lot more.Final verdict - its OK.
There are more than a few supporting non-teen characters.
This book is just as made for adults as for teens IMO.Malley managed to pull me right in, something not easily done.
I felt like I wanted to jump in the book and change all of the rules.
I wanted to save Anna Peter, and her parents and ever other Surplus.
I think what I liked most was what happened with Anna's parents.
This is probably my love of non-fiction streaming over into my fiction reading but either way, a 'happily-ever-after' ending rarely does it for me.
What happened with Anna's parents needed to happen.
This book has the political view points of Unwind and the government pull of Hunger Games.
During the story you find out what happens to the word when a drug company finds a way for people to stop the aging process and what has to be done in order to preserve resources.
People are made to sign a declaration in which they promise to stop having kids in order to take this new longevity drug and live virtually forever.
But, as you guessed some people decide that having kids is worth more and go against this order.
Ik kan niet wachten om verder te lezen over Surplus Anna.Mijn complete recensie vind je op Oog op de Toekomst.-- 2015 --I absolutely loved The Declaration.
Anna, our protagonist, is a Surplus.First of all I loved the idea behind this book.
I feel like the world could be like this in the future..
I really loved Anna's point of view, because she is so brainwashed in Grange Hall, feeling like a Burden who doesn't Know Her Place and working hard to repay her sins.
I feel like this book really questions the current society we're living in and I like that a lot.
This book could've been really been nice, but it absolutely wasn't. I liked the idea of the story, but hated how it was told. The characters were flat and uninteresting, but what I hated most about this book was the writing. It was immature and everything was described with the same words. Like I said, this could've been a really good book, but it was pretty much ruined by the writing and how the author told the story.
5 stars would be if I‚Äôd read it more than once lol.
This book is all about longevity and living forever if it meant you couldn‚Äôt have kids.
And they were told their parents hated them and that was another reason they were there.
Anna was the model surplus and did everything she was told.
My biggest shock in the whole story was when the truth about Peter and his heritage came out.
I hated that Anna‚Äôs parents did what they do but I can understand it.
And it‚Äôs a quick read too.
I read this one back in high school, and remember loving it. This time around, it was a bit too YA for my current taste. I won‚Äôt be reading the rest of the series. The premise is interesting, but the characters are too immature, and things get resolved too quickly, neatly and unbelievably for my liking.
I'm speed typing this so I can go and start the second book right away!I loved Anna's character.
(hide spoiler)]Mrs Pincent was the most interesting character to me I think.
But she just kept on getting more and more evil and ruthless and crazy as the book went on!(view spoiler)[When she was talking about how she was the one who cared the most for her son, and was going to have her Ex do something good for him for once by dying for him, it was so ironic!
I'm sure loads of people would guess that too, but I still love getting predictions right haha.
This is teen targeted fiction published by Bloomsbury Children's Books, but the premise is so completely fascinating that I'd literally recommend this book to the 12 to 102 crowd with no reservations.It's the year 2140 and the fountain of youth has come to the world by way of Longevity, a drug that literally letspeople live forever.
Of course, rules get broken and illegal children get born--they are the Surpluses.
But of course there is a rebel faction trying to rescue the children and keep the "old ways" of freedom and variety alive.This book is extremely well thought out, and I found it equally terrifying and fascinating.
It‚Äôs been a long time since I stopped watching these kind of series but I think I‚Äôve already seen enough for me to not like it when it makes a guest appearance on the books I read.
It‚Äôs not enough for me to dislike the book, but enough for me to consider it a mediocre one.The Declaration, by any means, is one flawed boo but it is still thought-provoking one, which is a feat for something you can read in the span of 2-3 hours.
4.5 stars really. It started off kind of slow but I enjoyed it overall. There were some surprises and I felt the ending was different than most dystopian YA books, which I liked. I also got an Anne Frank vibe which I didn't hate.
This book is very SPECIAL!!!! It‚Äôs everything, I cried in the end ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•loved it from the beginning until the last word written in it, so many beautiful emotions ‚ò∫It‚Äôs an oldie but a goodie ü§©

This story is set in a future world where people live forever making it illegal to have children because of overpopulation.
Longevity drugs have made it possible for people to live forever but with this brings a tremendous strain on the world.
I love one of the final quotes from Anna about this, "I know that we have to live each moment because we won't be here for ever, and that I wouldn't want to be anyway, because knowing something's going to end makes you appreciate it more, makes you want to savour every moment." More people should take this advice.I tend to really like dystopias and this one is certainly original.
Its also about differences in society with those that are somewhere legally as opposed to illegally and how they are treated.
This is a cleverly chilling concept of society in which a drug called ' Longevity' has resulted in old age, or at least death, becoming something one opts into, bringing about the horrendous situation where children become as rare as hens' teeth and can only be born if the parent is prepared to die for them; a life for a life.
Maybe this is her intention, to challenge us to reflect on issues as diverse as ecology and sustainability, the inevitability of ageing and the fear of death and the need to nurture the young, the centrality of loving relationships for our proper development and the concept that nobody is surplus no matter how many others may say this, once they feel loved.

I am making this point because while THE DECLARATION involves two teenagers, fourteen-year-old Anna and fifteen-year-old Peter, it never feels aimed towards the teen audience Therefore it is categorized as a young adult novel by the age of its narrators rather than its content and this, I believe, will give it an enduring quality.
Lewis wrote, "Where the children's story is simply the right form for what the author has to say, then of course readers who want to hear that will read the story or reread it at any age." THE DECLARATION opens in the year 2140, and people have conquered death in the form of Longevity drugs.
But with nobody dying anymore, the Earth is slowly filling up, so a new rule is applied if you want to take the drugs (which everyone does): you have to sign the Declaration, promising you won't have any children.Anna is a teenaged "Surplus," and lives in Grange Hall, which is basically an institute for turning illegal children into slaves.
I was surprised to find the author's writing to be quite simple, which made the book seem to be aimed more at preteens than teenagers, but I would still label it "young adult" over "middle grade" because of some violence toward the end.
Anna lives in Grange Hall with other surpluses, where she is trained to be ‚Äúuseful‚Äù and a ‚Äúgood asset‚Äù which to Anna means that she‚Äôll be able to make up for the crime of being born.Children are a rarity in this world as when people first take the drug ‚ÄúLongevity‚Äù, which provides longevity, they sign a declaration to say they will not have children.
Only those who opt out can have children legally and very few opt out, unfortunately for Anna her parents don‚Äôt opt out, so Anna was taken away from them when she was just a baby.Grange Hall is a barbaric place where the children are brain washed into thinking their worthless.
Very different type of book.UPDATED 9/14/10Having ponderend it some.....I'd actually give this book a 4.5 - .5 of that being for the sheer innovativeness of the story.
Well, for some, because the people in THIS story are living forever.
It's very 1984-ish in tone.The children born illegally, meaning virutally EVERY child being born since if you take Longevity (the drug) you make a declaration NOT to ever have children, are hunted down and snatched from their parents, and raised in orphanage-type warehouses where they are taught to be Useful and A Valuable Asset.
Surpluses are taken away from their parents and raised in a facility such as Grange Hall where our protagonist Surplus Anna resides.
That or end up in a work camp or, even more likely, dead.
I liked that Anna wasn't rebellious from the start.
Right up to the melodramatic ending scene which had me holding the book at arm's length in disbelief.
I wanted to like The Declaration.
I wanted to like Anna and Peter and their shadowy resistance-fighting parents.
No matter how much I wanted it to.
A future where resources are scarce and people live forever, thanks to the wonder drug Longevity.
In order to be eligible to take Longevity, people have to sign the Declaration, stating they will never have any children...although there are some who have broken the rules.
He has wild ideas about the Authorities, Surpluses and the wonder drug Longevity, he challenges everything being taught to the Surpluses at Grange Hall and also claims to know Anna's parents!I thought this was a great book, really made you stop and think about how the world truly works!
I really like the characters and the book was interesting and thought provoking.
That is why I did not give it five stars: there was something more I wanted.
It is one of those books that I want a sequel for, but at the same time, don't.
Just today in biology we were discussing genetic engineering and how that could extend life.
Because of this book, extending life even to 200 years seemed less desirable to me.
It also caused me to think about what I would have chosen, what I would have done if I were Mrs. Sharpe or Shela of any of the characters.
pure awesomeness!!!basically its about the future where they created these pills that make you look younger and live longer.
It started out that you could only have 1 child because everthing was getting over populated, but that became too much so you couldn't have any children, unless you dont take the pill.
But people who do take the pill and haave children have to give they're children up and got o jail, so its about Anna, she is a surplus (a child born outsride the law) and she is a model surplus, obidient never breaking the rules, thinkning its right and hates her parents.
