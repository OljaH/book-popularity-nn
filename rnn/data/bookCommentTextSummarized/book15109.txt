Fantastic recording! Kelsey Grammer and John Lithgow are the highlights. Surprising letdown was Dustin Hoffman reading Horton Hears a Who. His cadence was off so much it's hard to listen.
I loved Dr. Seuss as a child and am now rediscovering that joy as I read these stories to my own child.
The Cat in the Hat is a wonderful book and I think all children should read it. Everything by Dr. Seuss is so fantastic and creative. And I think it will open the minds of children or anyone really to explore their own creativity.
This book is just classic. Every kid has to read it, and every adult has to read it to their kids.

My son loved it...we own most of the books, so we were following along. My son's review "I liked it very good".
Dr Seuss is one of the funniest and most original children's book authors I have encountered, and I have encountered a lot! The Cat in the Hat is probably his most popular, it is a classic, but my favourites would be Green Eggs and Ham, and Oh, the places you'll go!, as the colourful illustrations and clever rhymes enthralled both my parents reading it to my young self, and myself. I still reread Dr Seuss books sometimes, as they are crazy and light-hearted, I would recommend them.
Like Mr. Brown, I think this Dr. Seuss book would also be great for building skills in phonics. It reminds me of activities we have talked about in class where children can explore how adding a new letter to "at" can change the sound and make a new word.
Cool cool cool cool cool$$$$$$$
Having read this 25 times this autumn I am including it in my reading log despite it not filling my 100 page requirement (though it does, the 61 is complete fiction)
Best.Thing.Ever! Am listening to this in my car and feeling like a 4 year old all over again.
An exceptional read.
Classic. I laughed. I cried. Maybe I even farted. Who knows—I was only six when I first read this book.
I like this book so much Emory
Great book for bedtime story...children love the rhyming words.
AMAZING! OUTSTANDING PIECE OF LITERATURE! SHOULD BE TAUGHT AT A-LEVEL!
Unfortunately, at certain places, the music and sound effects got a bit too enthusiastic; it overwhelmed the narrator's voice and made it just a little hard to focus on such as in The Cat in the Hat.I enjoyed all the books, and I thought that the issues that some of these books dealt with were done so in a child-friendly way.
The background music and his narration melded smoothly - like one.
The Cat in the Hat Comes Back, narrated by Kelsey Grammer There wasn't anything special I wanted to note for this book.
sadly I did not grow up reading these, but it is never too late!
A great audiobook! Love that different actors read the stories.
They have nothing to do until a cat with a hat comes and shows them some games they can play inside.
The cat makes a mess and the fish, the “mature” one, gets mad, so the cat shows them other games with Thing 1 and Thing 2.
The kids are left with the mess but the cat comes back and shows them how to clean up the mess.
Parent's who are really strict about what their child reads may look at this book as bad and influencing because of all the disobedient things the cat does.
The Cat in the Hat: This book is about a young boy and young girl who are forced to stay inside during a rainy day.
The afternoon takes a quick turn when the Cat in the Hat shows up and participates in many fun and crazy activities with the children.
This book teaches you to always clean up after you make a mess and lying, trust, and responsibility.
This book is also a great way to teach students that they have the responsibility to clean up after they make a mess.
The children get a knock at the door and it is a cat who is full of entertainment.
Long story short, the children have a pet fish who is stressed out over the mess that the cat is making.
The cat leaves, and returns to help clean up the mess as the mother is almost to the door.
This book is a rest book to introduce the children to poetry, and Dr. Seuss.
I love this book because it teaches a good lesson, to clean up the messes you create, however, at the same time it teaches a poor lesson of letting strangers into your home.
Kelsey Grammer narrates this book and it's fabulous!
When I read this book out loud to A it just seems like it takes forever to get through but Grammer reads it with enthusiasm and it rolls right off the tongue and A isn't even ready to turn the page yet.
There is a part in the story that makes me laugh everytime during this recording which is fabulous to find a book for both my 2yr old and me to listen to over and over and over and over again (did I mention she was 2?) I love Dr. Seuss but he can be very hard to read aloud well so two big thumbs up to Grammer.
Picture Book 12: This book is my all time favorite dr.seuss books.
It was my first dr.seuss book I ever read when I was little and this is the book that got me hooked on all of his books!
I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, which cannot be that many people because it is such a classic.
I hope children today appreciate all this book has to offer and I hope it gets children into dr.seuss like it hooked me.
I decided to read it again just for old times sake and it still is a really good book!
This book is wonderful for kids that love to rhyme.
This book is about two kids having to stay inside because it was raining outside.
The kids got into so much mischief, but they realized their mother would not be happy with how her house looked if she came back home.
The kids told the cat to help them clean up the house and fix their messes.
This book helps children realize that having fun is not always fun for everyone.
You do not know who you could be hurting because of your mischief.
This was a book that always made me want to reach through the pages and literally strangle the Cat in the Hat. Dr. Seuss gave us a great little story about all the trouble two children with nothing to do can get into. "Idle hands are the devil's tool," is truer than many people might think.This book is a must have in every family library. It's fun and teaches a great lesson.Purchase The Cat in the Hat.
The Cat in the Hat was one of my favorite Dr Seuss books as a child, along with Green Eggs and Ham, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, Fox in Sox, The Lorax and Where is My Mother? The storyline embodies naughtiness and excitement beyond any child’s imagination, not to mention an adventuresome child. The illustrations are something incomparable – both in execution and design. The skilful nonsense rhyme and its delicious rhythm make it a delight to both read and read aloud. The invention, the pace, the wordage – all are timeless and will never be topped.
The Cat in the Hat is a classic.
Dr. Seuss is probably everyone child's favorite author without them knowing it.
The book is witty, it rhymes, the illustrations are colorful, and it is not that long.
Any Dr. Seuss book is a great book for anyone.
Every child should read these books.
They are simple to read and it is easy to follow along, since it rhymes.
Rhyming helps children learn how to read better in my opinion.
I personally love Dr. Seuss books and all of them are recommended, but i think this is the first book I've ever read from him.
This audiobook had 12 classic Dr. Seuss tales including my absolute favorite tale, "The Lorax". This was a great audiobook because, of course, the stories stand the test of time. But it was also great because of the quality of narrators overall. The stories were read by the likes of Ted Danson, Kelsey Grammar, Dustin Hoffman and John Lithgow. You could tell by the narration that the narrators were truly enjoying the stories and were reading as if they were sharing this beloved story with their own child.
