Every word he said would make a girl smile) I'm classifying this book as strong female because I loved the fact that when Geric wrote Ani off, she was upset and angry, but her world did not collapse (contrast that to Bella in New Moon who did not want to live after Edward left her because that was her sole purpose for being on this earth, please!) I loved that Ani was upset, but had more important things to do than sulk over a guy that didn't work out (like save the Bayern kingdom from a dishonest queen and the Kilendrean kingdom from an impending war!) I think she was more upset about losing her horse than losing Geric.
And now I'm REALLY excited to read Enna Burning just as soon as it gets here through ILL!!April 3, 2009In an Austin Powers voice: "One million stars..."It's been a really long time since I added a book to my favorites bookshelf.
Usually books that make you tear-up do so near the end, you know?
it was like 50 pages into the book, and I'm on the verge of tears.
I read your Austenland book, and it had a happy ending...
Ani/Isi shows REMARKABLE character development through the course of the book, which is fabulous!
Just wonderful.Anyway, go read the book.
I've always loved fairy tale novelizations, and The Goose Girl is right up at the top for me.
It's a lovely adaptation of the old Goose Girl fairy tale.
But there are forces at play here that Ani doesn't initially recognize, ambitions and passions of others that will upend all plans and send Ani down a path she'd never anticipated.The Goose Girl is a delightful and well thought-out take on the old fairy tale, and is one of my favorite fairy tale novels.
Ani becomes the palace goose girl, and she hides in the castle hoping to earn enough money to return home…This book started out very slowly, I had to work hard to get to the point where the plot was moving quickly.
Once Ani reaches her new kingdom is where the story gets really interesting.
Ani is a great role model for young girls because she learned from her experiences and did not give up, she was kind to other people even when they weren’t that nice to her.
Wow, is all I can say, just plain old flat out wow.
You expect this to be some sort of, princess fairy tale, in a sense it is just give it a little bit of action and suspense and there you go, The Goose Girl, It goes in a direction you totally don't expect, all of a sudden Ani the little naive princess is suddenly on the run from the scary warriors!The ending doesn't disappoint there's even a battle, who'd expect that from a Princess Fairytale?I really liked how it kind of kept you on your toes the entire time and when you think you're safe for a while Shannon Hale sends in the bad guys and attack Ani in the middle of the night.

But Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree knew her place in the world and even though her family let her down, she accepted her given destiny standing tall, even though it killed her to be sent away from her beloved country.And even though her path took an unexpected turn and she met misery and deception and loss and the hurt of traitorous friends, she was rewarded with new friendships, kindness among people who saw her for who she really was and found her inner self and claimed her rightfull position for the love of the ones who loved her.
I really enjoyed the second half of this book.
I had so much trouble believing that the characters just somehow believed that Ani was who she said she was.
Like when she told Enna who she really was Enna didn't doubt her, she instantly believed her, and the same can be said about the other characters except the scene in the end of the book.
And it wasn't until the end of the book where someone first doubted her...
I would have thought more characters wouldn't have believed her until she somehow proved she was Ani. Anyway...
4.5/5I really enjoyed this book! I'm not sure what it was, but there was something missing that just held me back from five stars. It read more like a fairytale than a retelling, which I am not mad about. The ending felt kind of like a Disney movie, in that it wrapped up almost a little too perfectly. I'm looking forward to reading Enna Burning!
The Goose Girl is an adaptation of the Grimm fairy tale by the same name — which I had never heard of before reading this book.
;-)That comes in handy, though, when reading a new story — I figured that Princess Anidori-Kiladra (a.k.a. Ani; a.k.a. Isi, the Goose Girl; a.k.a. the Yellow Lady … there’s a lot about disguise and identity in this story, if you can’t tell) would live happily ever after — the heroines always do in fairy tales.
I think the most frequent comment I've heard about her as an author is, "She's LDS and like Stephenie Meyer, doesn't write LDS fiction." I'm not sure it was a good enough reason to check out her book, Goose Girl, but I did it anyway.
My sister, Jen, liked this book and that was one more reason, but a good enough one for me.It was a nice break from some of the meatier stuff I've been reading.
But sometimes, it's nice to simply read a good story.
I think this was/is especially true in terms of the emotional aspects of the characters--I could totally hear it in their voices, which was refreshing.In terms of the story, I really enjoyed the character of Geric.
Though I haven't read the blurb on the back of the second book (I think I'll probably listen to that one too, if it is available), I hope she and Finn get together.
Imagine you're in the process of discovering that you can hear voices, whether they are from animals or nature.
I felt like Ani was an idiot for not running to her horse as soon as she thought something was up.4.
It is a fairy tale retelling, and the story didn't promise to be a very good one.
However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I really loved this story and the characters.Since I am a huge fan of fairy tales, I was worried that Hale wouldn't have done a very good job at writing out a story that was inspired by the fairy tale of the same name.
I found that I fell in love with the characters, the story line, the storytelling, and the way the book was written.
[5.0 Stars] Original Rating[4.5 Stars] Re-Read 2016I still absolutely adore this book, but I confess Ani/Isi really annoyed me the first 50 pages or so. For those reasons this re-read gets knocked down half a star. My original rating still stands though. This book is a favorite of mine because of how simple, magical, and heartwarming it is. Can't wait to re-read Enna Burning!
Super fun read. Incredible imagination that was clear and easy to read. Very likeable characters that made the books that followed interesting and appealing.
It's hard to say much without creating spoilers, so I will say only that I think that, in Hale's mind, Ani (the Goose Girl) developed and grew and changed and came into her own a lot more than was apparent to me.
I guess it just promised a lot, and every time I'd start a chapter I would think, oh, yes, here we go, NOW we are going to flesh out so-and-so character or NOW we are going to see the fruition of Plot Point A...but, no--instead we'd get some repetition of other points.
Love this book just as much on my third reread. <3
But let's move on...I was super excited and nervous to start reading this, mostly because it sounded sooo good, and I wanted it to live up to that.
I love how much Conrad came around in the end.-Talking to animals.
(view spoiler)[My love for Falada is probably what made me not want to believe he was dead.
If there was one thing I could change about this book, Falada's death would be it.
I am so jealous, and I now want to move to Bayern, thank you very much.
I loved how Hale worked in Enna.
(view spoiler)[And killing horses.
Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee was born the Crown Princess of Kildenree, but her mother didn’t feel she was fit to rule and instead arranged a marriage with a neighboring kingdom, passing the title on to Ani’s brother.
That is, until she finds out war’s coming and she no longer has time to return home, but must instead take back her name and her heritage to protect her kingdom.This is the first Shannon Hale book that I’ve read, and I now understand why everyone’s been singing her praises.
This wasn't my typical fare, but I have a friend who loved it and it came highly recommended.
It's full of great characters who are fun to root for with a tense plot that even threw a few surprises at me.
It was just that there was too much poor acting, including the voice of the main girl, who was only reading the dialogue not the majority of the book luckily.
It's so focused on the main girl, the Goose Girl, that it misses any kind of depth with the rest of the world.
Where the elements have speech and animals form spoken bonds with a single person.If I EVER lived in one of the worlds I have read about, I would live in this world that Shannon Hale has created.I always say that if I had a super power, I would have power over the elements (water, air, fire, earth).
The world that Hale has created has that, and more.Imagine a world where you could learn the speech of different animals.
No, it isn’t like talking animals on TV; it’s like, for example, you would understand what a certain bark means, or a honk of a goose.
I really liked this fairytale retelling.
We have a princess in dire need, we have a handsome prince, an evil lady-in-waiting who wants to be princess, and we have some magic.This had such a magical feel to it, which is why I love fairytales.
It was also pretty grueling at times (like in real fairytales, where I’m shocked when reading to my 4 year old that so many people are maimed, beaten, hanged, etc.).
It seems nothing can beat a true hard-won HEA fairytale style with a nice dramatic showdown.
The Goose Girl (The Books of Bayern #1), Shannon Hale
However, when Ani’s life is threatened by Selia and Ungolad, Ani becomes a stronger character as the book goes on as she realizes that she is on her own and she must figure out a way to convince the king that she is the real Crown Princess without the aid of her mother.
This was........THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!Great plot kept me on the edge of my seat 💺 No swearing,sex,and a little violence but no gore just mentioned. Love it 😍 READ IT NOW IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I did enjoy the book - in parts - but overall I was underwhelmed and left feeling that the book could have been so much better.At times, Hale's writing was very poetic, painting a vibrant picture in her unique and fluid style.
At other times, it felt redundant, and time was spent on unimportant descriptions.I liked the characters, but wanted more from them.
And while I think each character was supposed to be unique in their own right, there wasn't much that separated one from the other.But, I still feel the story is worth three stars because, for whatever reason, I was always curious to read the next chapter, always curious to see what exactly would transpire.
If you'd like to see my full thoughts, you can check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcr2X...This book is pure magic. The writing is poetic and romantic and beautiful. The plot is faithful to the fairytale that it's retelling, but it brings new and exciting things to the table. The fantasy elements are understated but really enhance the story, and the characters, oh the characters, are spectacular.
A fairy tale fantasy novel full of imagination and creativity, The Goose Girl could easily fit in with Brother Grimm's or Hans Christian Anderson's work. With a wonderful main character and vibrantly-described settings, it's a book no reader will ever forget.
This book is impossibly sweet and wonderful. I'm only sorry it took me so long to read it!
And in this book it wasn't like the character already knew these things, she had to learn how to speak these languages and understand them.
There was times that I wanted to look up the area on the Internet to learn more about it just to remember that is set in a fictional place, rats!I was able to relate so much to Ani. I haven't read a lot of books that has a great introvert character as this book does.
Even though, Ani seem to be like introvert, that didn't mean she didn't want to be with people, she did.
