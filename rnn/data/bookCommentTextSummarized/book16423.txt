This is an older series and many of you may have read it years ago or already decided it wasn't for you, but maybe my review will sway you into giving it a chance (or just make you remember how much you loved it.)Here's my take on things:Be prepared for a male author with all male main characters.
There are not a lot of authors writing stories like Shan's and I think it fills a nice pocket that fans of the Goosebumps series can stick their hand into once they start getting older.
This is NOT a fluffy-happy-cloud middle school book Darren Shan and his three best friends manage to score two tickets to the Cirque du Freak - a one-night-only freak circus that promises hair-raising terror and blood-curdling sights. Through a bit of luck ( or was it fate? ) both Darren and Steve are chosen to attend. The circus certainly lives up to its name - Hans Hands, Remus Two-Bellies and the Snakeboy were all absolutely magnificent. And then...there was the trained spider. The most amazi
This is NOT a fluffy-happy-cloud middle school book Darren Shan and his three best friends manage to score two tickets to the Cirque du Freak - a one-night-only freak circus that promises hair-raising terror and blood-curdling sights.
The most amazing spider in the world and there was just one, all-consuming thought to run through Darren's head, I must have her.
(thank goodness - I've read too many books with romance shoe-horned in to "keep the girls interested" - us girls are perfectly capable of enjoying a story sans love subplot, thankyouverymuch).
This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read! I used to hate reading I found it a chore. I only read school books. This book changed that normally I'm not normally into horror books but Darren Shan is different he is such a cool and likeable person. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes reading, this book is a great start to a series I loved. I re-read the series all the time. If you read it, then I am 86% sure you will love it.
عنوان: قصه های سرزمین اشباح : جلد یک 1 : سیرک عجایب؛ نویسنده: دارن شان؛ مترجم: سوده کریمی؛ فرزانه کریمی؛ تهران، قدیانی، کتابهای بنفشه؛ 1382؛ دارن شان برای معرفی خویش در نخستین صفحه از داستان میگوید: وقتی بچه بودم خیلی دلم میخواست از چیزی بترسم، از عنکبوت خوشم میآمد، مامان و بابای دارن شان در نه سالگی به او یک رطیل هدیه میدهند، تا نگهداری کند.
اما چرا این فراموشکار این کتابها را خواندم، دلم میخواست بدانم بچه هایم چرا این کتابها را میخوانند، چه چیزی در این داستانها توجه آنها را جلب کرده، پس از آنها مجموعه را خواندم، آن هم دوبار، انگار نوجوان شده بودم، هنوز هم کتابهای فانتزی و نوجوانان را دنبال میکنم.
As a reading teacher, I'm always reading books to determine whether or not my students might enjoy reading them, too.
However, this school year, several of my students have been recommending books TO ME to read!
This is another such recommendation.
I have heard from many students how much they enjoy the Cirque Du Freak series, so I decided to give the first book a try.
Hey, whatever it takes to get students reading more books!In this story, Darren and his friend Steve attend a "freak show" unlike anything they've ever seen.
I enjoyed this when I was younger and now as wellHowever I do think it’s pretty dark for the age group intended
Easy to read and engrossing.
review by Megsly*Warning: possible spoilers ahead.*A few weeks ago, this charming little movie called The Vampire's Assistant came on my television and I, being obsessed with vampires as everyone knows, just had to watch and I was extremely impressed by the originality of the movie so when I unearthed the series, The Saga of Darren Shan, I dove right in.A Living Nightmare is book one of the The Saga of Darren Shan, otherwise known as Cirque du Freak.
I didn't really like the idea of the freak show, but I did think that it was a novel way to introduce this story, and a different sort of motif for a children's series.
I think it's because I read Lord Loss first, which was about a teenager, but I feel was written in a way that seemed more mature and advanced enough that an adult reader didn't even notice that it was for children.
I was really impressed that Darren Shan (the author) was fearless enough to incorporate this aspect into a children's book.The look at vampire lore had a life of its own.
Just a quick fun read. Nothing complicated, nothing fancy. Perfect book for tweens and young teens.

So good! This is exactly what horror/fantasy book/series for kid should be. It have good characters, it's fast pace, have some dark enough stuff and a really intriguing storyline! I can wait to read the next one! Well done!
Upon rereading in 2018, I give the first one 4 stars.It reads as more middle grade and is slow paced at first, but after the second half, oh boy! The pace really picks up and my excitement to continue the series grew. That ending really hit hard as an "adult" now much more than it did as a kid when death meant little to me. Way to keep the reader hooked!
But all epics are like that, right?
(yes that is the name of the author) He and his friend, Steve, secretly go to a freak show in town.
They see amazing acts that will totally freak and gross you out.
The last performer, Mr. Crepsley and his amazing spider, are what really gets the story going.
Both boys claim that he is a vampire they saw in a book they read.
After the show, Darren leaves but Steve stays.
Darren comes back and watches Steve ask Mr. Crepsley to turn him into a vampire where Mr. Crepsley refuses.
Before they leave, Darren steal Mr. Crepsley spider.
Es war jetzt echt nicht so meins..
It had a shallow plot, something obviously meant for children or teens younger than 18.
I have to press the issue again regarding books that really not scary but they are considered as horror.
This book didn't scare me at all, but like I said, it was meant for children- young adult, although I have to say anyone who is over 13 wouldn't consider this horror.
It had a very predictable plot but I don't know why I finished it in one sitting.
The book was just okay for me, but maybe I should've read this years ago, because my genre preference has obviously changed.
Buku ini sudah lama ada di rak buku, tapi baru tersentuh karena penasaran (ada teman yang sangat suka dengan Darren Shan >_<Ceritanya kejam, jahat, dan mengerikan! Benar-benar kisah vampir yang sesungguhnya. Yang paling menyayat hati adalah kelanjutan persahabatan Darren dengan ketiga sahabatnya, terutama Steve :'(Pokoknya, baca sendiri deh! Mau review panjang tapi takut spoiler..
3.5 🌟A promising beginning to an already intriguing series. It's funny, dark, and a quick, entertaining read. I like Darren Shan as the narrator, he's a likeable character. I'll be sure to continue the series.
Interesting first book. I have seen these on the shelves in the library since I was a teenager so of course I thought it finally time to read them. Very action packed always moving and doing something. I might have to see where this all leads to.
I am not sorry I read it, just sorry the book didn't live up to my expectations.This book is about Darren, a boy who seems to have a decent heart - Kind of.
Then Darren and his best friend Steve get into a freak show, and their lives change forever when a spider and a vampire are introduced into their lives.The characterizations in this book were very inconsistent.
We are told so, but NOTHING in the book before this was mentioned showed us that Steve was anything more than a normal boy.
BUT he breaks Darren's neck and THEN throws him out the window?

Cirque Du Freak #1: A Living NightmareDarren Shan183 PagesHaperCollins PublishersUK £4.99ISBN: 0-00-675416-3	A Living Nightmare will bring a chilling sensation right after you read the book told by the gruesome-styled author Darren Shan who is also the protagonist of the story.
Darren Shan, known as the protagonist of the story, started off having a normal life with friends, family, and school.
The horror forged within this book will tell you a story long to remember and fear.
The author Darren Shan does not only write a book.
The first Cirque Du Freak book is a nice read that really pumped me up for Halloween.
For once we have a main character whose family life isn't messed up or not there.
In fact Darran Shan the main character comes from a really good home life and actually loves his family including his youngest sister.
He is as normal as they come, other then having a obsession over spiders, it's refreshing to see a normal kid with a normal life in a middle grade book.
I love how he tells the story and he's just a very fond character.
He's definitely a brave character and will do anything to keep his friends and family safe and that's what I loved about him.Steve was also a very interesting character.
I can't wait to see how his character develops during the next few books.Mr Crepsley was really mysterious, but I also found his character to be very likeable and really funny.
I also love how he treats Darren during this book.The plot: The plot was amazing.
This book was just ASDJFDGJDFDASJDASDFJDSAAD I love it.

Re-read 5.5.17: I love it. Forever and always. A ta jedna scéna mě skoro rozbrečela... Stačí jedna nostalgická písnička a už sem se do toho re-readingu musela pustit... Re-reading mi jen prospěl. Připomněla jsem si ten skvělý styl, jakým byl Darren napsán a pobavila jsem se u hlášek pana Hroozleyho. Díky fobii z pavouků jsem měla trochu nahnáno při některých scénách, ale jinak to byl skvělý rozjezd a už se hodně těším na další díl.
This book was so scary, but it was AWESOME! I can't wait to read the next one.
I recommend the audio of this series. The narrator does an excellent job of milking the gothic aspects.
This book was sinister, dark, evil and at times quite funny.
Darren seemed a little scared of most things and naturally a coward even if he wanted to do something he didn't well until he made the decision to become a half vampire to save his best friend.
Overall this was a dark twisted sinister book which isn't usually something I like but this was well something else, I don't know if it was the descriptions of the characters and scenes that made me want to know more or just the story but I want to read the next one too.
And I loved it!
At first I read the introduction, and I was like, wow, this is real?
Yeah, I don't think so.
But, I loved the characters.
So, I watching one of those book hauls/reviews on YouTube.
Yeah, well I was watching the review, and she said the writing was very immature, and too many explanation points.
Yeah, um, no.
There is always something exciting going on the book.
I'm not going to say anything about what the book what about because I do not want to ruin it, but yeah.
Read the book.
Even though this series is obviously meant for young people, I (currently age 32) found many aspects of this book to be enjoyable and entertaining. It was really dark -- I was honestly surprised at how dark it went considering it IS for young adults. There were a couple of moments where I laughed out loud, too. I am definitely going to read the rest of the series because I'm curious to see where the plot goes.
