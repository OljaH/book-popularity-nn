“I asked them why when they persecute men, for religion or colour it was seen by the world as oppression and when they persecute women, it was dismissed as tradition.” Emer Martin This book is generally brilliant if you ignore the misogyny.
To that end he sets up an experiment where the men, MIT students, will have to answer a set of questions 'sober' and while they are wanking to pictures of buxom young women flashed on their computers.The questions include, Would you want to have sex with a really fat woman?
I haven't written a review of that book, but where the hell would I start?When I’m reading books I often think – you know, I would like to re-write this.
Let’s ask half of them some questions related to them being Asian (not too obvious, let’s just ask questions like how many languages do you speak, what is your migrant experience – you know, vague enough so we aren’t directly saying “THINK ASIAN, THINK ASIAN” at them, but actually, when you think about it a little bit, that is exactly what we are doing).
While I am getting more and more inured to this way of analysis of behavioral economics and physchology, these kinds of books are still hard to resist - that is because they do, no matter if they have now become an industry doling out similiar books by the dozens, still stretch our perspectives about the things we normally take for granted or think unworthy of a second thought.
This way the students, teachers, and parents might see the larger point in education and become more enthusiastic and motivated about it.
The author does experiments with college students and beer, and extrapolates this into a world view.
Would you like to live in such a world?" Excuse me, but I prefer to base my world view on more than just the impressions of 1 college student, but this is an example of how he doesn't use logic to come to his conclusions.
Would an objective researcher characterize one of his subjects as "a clever master's student with a charming Indian accent?" Wouldn't you be more likely to agree with the conclusion than if the participant was a "clever hunchback with an aversion to bathing?" He ascribes all kinds of emotions to his subjects throughout the book.
Honestly all the business books that talk about psychological research or behavioral economics talk about the same things.
I haven't even read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman but all these books literally rehash it again and again so I probably wouldn't even get anything out of reading it now.
That said this one's much better written than most of the other books I've read and so if you haven't read anything else about behavioral economics or that way we make decisions this is a good choice.
If you have read other books on those things though I'd skip this one because it doesn't add anything new.
It is only in the last 25 years that economists have begun to investigate the irrational side of consumer behavior.
Dan Ariely's book, "Predictably Irrational", offers a clear and comprehensive overview of this fascinating subject.
How can the triggers for dishonest behavior be disarmed?The book is based primarily on work that Ariely has done with colleagues at M.I.T. and elsewhere.
Two features make the book exceptional, in my opinion:The ability of Ariely and colleagues to devise really neat experiments to test their hypotheses.
The book was a joy to read.I highly recommend "Predictably Irrational".
Social norms are the exchanges and requests we make as part of personal connections.
Here's where it gets interesting:"In the lasts few decades, companies have tried to market themselves as social companions--that is, they'd like us to think that they and we are family, or at least are friends that live on the same cul-de-sac.
If the relationship is based on market norms, the bank charges a fee and the customer shakes it off.
After all, this was a relationship framed as a social exchange."No parallels to Goodreads here.
Of course, social psychologists have been doing this for over half a century without much public fanfare or guest spots on "MSNBC" or "CNN" every time people want to know how consumers make decisions.
His specific studies have examined sexual decision making and how people are more than twice as likely to rate their likelihood of engaging in various sexual behaviors as high when they are aroused vs.
He also suggests oaths and guilds might make ethics in business more likely because people would frame their decisions more on the code of conduct of their organization/profession instead of not really thinking about it.
What an interesting book. It complemented my last reading ~ Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman ~ in some ways. The examples in the book suggests that `The Neo Cortex` is such a funny dude that tricks us into thinking that we are making logical decision, that we are rational beings. In the meanwhile the other machinery that actually makes and executes the decision is pulling our strings. As stated in the book, we are a true Jeckll and Hyde dilemma. Very funny and the joke is on us.

Market exchanges versus social exchangesWe live in two worlds, one governed by market exchanges, and the other governed by social exchanges.Market exchanges are business...sharp-edged, prices, rates, interest, cost and benefits.Social exchanges are friendly...warm and fuzzy.People are happy to do things for free, eg give their time to charities, but you can't taint this by mixing in market exchanges with what is basically a social exchange.eg lawyers were asked if they would help poor elderly clients for £30.00 an hour.

Ariely is a good writer whose book catches onto the _Freakonomics_ craze by taking a look at times when people make different decisions that typical "laissez faire" economic theories would expect.
His book is a fairly easy read and does include some surprising results through social-science experimentation.
If people are going to make "better" decisions about things, someone somewhere is going to decide what "better" is.
If this is true, then this is tenfold true for random human beings (usually via government nannyism) who force "better" upon all people, rational or otherwise.
همه ی ما به طرز پیش بینی پذیری نابخردانه عمل می کنیم. این کتاب به موضوعات جالبی پرداخته است. موضوعات روزمره و دم دستی که عموم ما آدم ها در آن دچار اشتباه می شویم. خواندنش را به شدت توصیه می کنم.
Chapter 1: The Truth about Relativity: Why Everything is Relative--Even When It Shouldn't BeThe author uses an example of shopping for a house in another part of the United States.
He says, people accustomed to their own housing market set a mental "anchor" and expect to pay a similar price for a home elsewhere.
That's a no-no.Chapter 5: The Influence of Arousal: Why Hot Is Much Hotter Than We RealizeWell, I'm going to sum this up by saying that men (they didn't use women because men could become aroused faster) that were masturbating were more likely to accept or do things (sexually) that they wouldn't consider in a calm(er) state of mind.
Не дуже багато нового, але цікаво і дещо наочніше, ніж я це знала. В цілому підсумок наступний - ми ірраціональні, системно і передбачувано. З цим потрібно змиритися, але варто спробувати це налагодити, постійно рефлексуючи та відслідковуючи свої рішення. Тобто - постійна пильність, як казав А. Муді🤭
Here are just a few tidbit's I've learned:-If you're ever going to a bar, trying to score a little bit of lovin', bring a friend who looks very similar to you - only a little uglier.
That way you'll look like the ideal candidate, not just compared to your friend but to everyone else there.-People are more likely to steal things once removed from cash than cash - ie.
Predictably Irrational is an entertaining and enlightening read. The most important lesson I learned from Ariely is the high cost of free. The biggest example is "free shipping." Companies only offer you free shipping to convince you to spend at least the minimum amount to get it. Something to think about the next time I shop online.Many of Ariely's lessons on psychology were already explained to me in previous books, but that isn't a strike against him. It just shows that maybe humans aren't as difficult to figure out as we would like to think.
When I was studying psychology one of my favorite topics was judgment and decision-making, which dealt in large part with the kinks in the human mind that could lead us to irrational behavior and decisions.
And, perhaps most importantly, how do people in the know --people like advertisers, politicians, and psychology graduate students-- use these ideosycracities to subtly manipulate us?These are the kinds of questions that Ariely, a professor at MIT, discusses under the rubric of "behavioral economics." Each chapter is dedicated to a particular concept, like the anchoring effect, priming, social norms, supply and demand, procrastination, loss avoidance, the effects of price on perception, and the like.

یه ریویو نسبتا طولانی :چرا ما از آنچه که به نظر میرسد احمق تریم؟https://sadraa.me/%d9%86%d8%a7%d8%a8%...
reads like an extended, slightly dumbed down USA today article.
Проте, як для мене, людини далекої від економіки, дуже було цікаво.
Ден Аріелі займається тим, що досліджує ірраціональні дії людей.
А тим самим - уникнути багатьох ірраціональних і шкідливих для нас самих рішень.
Це книжка про те, як ми обираємо - товари в магазині та пиво у барі, чи впливає на нас вибір друзів, шалені знижки та акційні пропозиції, збудження, наша тотальна прокрастинація і тд.
У тому числі - чи потрібен нам тотальний контроль для дедлайнів, чи ми здатні самі себе контолювати.
Пригодиться, як на мене, усім, хто працює у сфері маркетингу, та прагне жити раціонально, попри те, що більшість наших виборів потрапляють у потік ірраціональності.
Un libro de sicología/sociología que destaca sobre la gran mayoría, porque el autor HACE EXPERIMENTOS para comprobar sus teorías.
Son experimentos fáciles, cotidianos y bastante divertidos, sobre todo cuando uno ve lo irracional que podemos ser las personas y cómo nos da por pisar el palito, jajaja.No leía este tipo de estudios desde la universidad.
Me trajo buenos recuerdos.Una cita divertida:"Suponga que está usted en un bar, disfrutando de la conversación con unos amigos.
Aunque la diferencia entre ambas resulta despreciable, seguramente será la de cero calorías la que le hará sentir del modo más saludable.
اگه قرار باشه 125 دلار بدیم، چرا فقط گزینه فیزیکی رو انتخاب کنیم در حالی که می تونیم هر دو نوع اشتراک رو به دست بیاریم؟ اما آیا حذف کردن این گزینه بیخود مفیده؟ این موضوع ظاهرا نباید توی درصد افرادی که تنها گزینه اینترنتی رو انتخاب کردن تاثیری داشته باشه.
افراد به دلیل رایگان بودن گزینه اول و پولی بودن گزینه دوم، محاسبه رو نادیده می گیرن.و یک مورد دیگه اینکه:اگه شرایطی فراهم باشه که امکان لو رفتن فرد پایین باشه، احتمال اینکه دزدی کنه تا حد خیلی زیادی افزایش پیدا می کنه.
Whether you are into behavioral economics or not, whether there are better books than "Predictably Irrational" out there or not, it is still a must read I feel.
For one, it is less economics and more behavioral psychology (this would be considered good or bad depending on your expectations though).
Three, the book makes you realize how complex human beings are, how the behavioral and emotional complexity makes us both more and less reasonable, both more and less predictable and hence effectively vulnerable as compared to the 'rational thinking human being' that was envisioned in classical economics.
If the brain is predictably irrational, then the books which warn us we aren’t the rational creatures we hope are also predictable.
I don’t think there was a single circumstance in Ariely’s book I wasn’t already aware of from one experiment or another, one summary or another.
It’s not Dan Ariely’s fault that I’ve read all this stuff before.If you don’t know much about the topic of the way our brains work, and how counter-intuitive it sometimes is, then this is a good place to start.
Unfortunately, that means I don’t have much to say about it — it didn’t hold any surprises for me.Originally posted here.
There are several reasons the acceptance of individual competition over striving for the group’s overall well-being seems to be a social norm rather than an innate human trait.
Instead, I believe if I brought this observation to Ariely he would say something like: Why do you think that is?
And while my feelings of isolation were not as deep as Ariely, there were many occasions where I felt like I was observing people around me with new eyes.
In other words, I take Ariely to be the kind of person who could acknowledge that people are both competitive and collaborative.
Ariely uses that premise to show how easy it is for companies such as Enron to steal vast sums without feeling the same as a mugger taking money from an old lady's purse, despite the end result being the same.People are influenced by brand names and logos, and knowing that it is a Coke you are drinking changes the amount of pleasure you get from your beverage than if you are having an anonymous cola.
As that would limit the use of the card by consumers, it's unlikely the companies would be interested in such a card.In the meantime, we are left with our irrational impulses to deal with.
