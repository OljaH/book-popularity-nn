"Agatha Christie was the greatest exponent of the classical detective story. Her unique literary talents have crossed every boundary of age, race, class, geography and education. While she refined the template for a fictional form, the reading of her books became an international pastime." John CurranI started reading and collecting Agatha Christie books when I was 9 years old. I adored her books and still do. There is a great comfort, as an adult, in reading her books and acute observations of people that favours style over the penny horrors of sadism, torture, and graphic violence favoured by some authors.
Pleased to have Joan Hickson narrating 2 of the stories so far.
Easy to picture her as the Miss Marple of the BBC tv series she portrayed, which adds to the enjoyment of listening!The stories are from 'Three Blind Mice and Other Stories' by the inimitable, Agatha Christie.
Listened to Strange Jest and The Case of the Caretaker Aug.29.13June 1.14I finally had my car back with it's double audio feature, so I was able to listen to the final 2 audios - The Case of the Perfect Maid and The Tape Measure Murder.
Really enjoy stories read by capable narrators.
Agatha Christie is the best crime writer in my opinion. She does have certain basic tricks she uses in all her books but if you like one, you'll most likely like all the others. Not to mention, she writes decently and her books are good entertainment and perfect to kill time when you have nothing else to do.
