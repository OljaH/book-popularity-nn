First published in 1934 it is a delightful collection of Twelve short stories. The very first one- The Listerdale mystery will leave you happy and on a positive note. Great beginning to the collection. There is also James Bond featuring in one of the stories, even though he has not to do anything with the other flamboyant Bond
I absolutely loved this collection.The best story in the collection according to me is Philomel Cottage - a real gem of suspense.
The way Alix Martin's world slowly unravels as discovers an unpalatable truth and the subsequent race to save herself had me biting my nails when I first read it.The next best for me is The Golden Ball - how a young man grabs "the golden ball of chance" finally after letting it go many a time.
This story actually reminded me a lot of Wodehouse.All the others are nice and lighthearted (except for Accident and Swan Song).
Highly enjoyable short stories collection which features 12 of Christie’s less known tales, though some were adapted for TV in the early 1980’s.They’re all quite humorous, I found The Girl in the Train and A Fruitful Sunday to be my favourites.Interestingly the main character in The Rajah's Emerald was called James Bond, I was half expecting him to be a secret agent!
This book is the collection of 12 short stories.
I liked some of the stories.
They had a good deal of mystery.
Overall I liked this book.
I love mystery novels of Agatha Christie.
She is one of the best mystery writers in the 1900's.
I enjoy reading her books because most of the time its really hard to predict the ending.
Below is the list of short stories in the book and my rating for each story:1.
The Listerdale Mystery- 2/52.
Sing a Song of Sixpence - 4/55.
Swan Song - 3/5Overall my rating is 3.5/5
من أجمل النوفيلات التي كتبتها أجاثا كريستي.
تحتوي المجموعة على القصص الآتية:الضحية العاشرةقرأت هذة القصة في مجموعة قصص قصيرة سابقة لأجاثا كريستي ولكنها لا سيما ممتعة وشيقة وتثير الرعب والخوف ومليئة بالإثارة والتشويقجريمة على الشاطئانه المثلث الأبدي كما يصفه هيركيول بوارو، المثلث الذي لا ينتج عن خيرا أبدا.
انه الزوجان والعشيق، والذي دوما ما ينتهي الأمر بحدوث جريمة قتل.
ترى من سيكون القاتل والقتيل في هذا المثلث المعتاد لدى أجاثا كريستي.
هذة ستدهشكم حقا!الزائر الغريبهذة بالنسبة لي كانت أجملهم على الإطلاق، ربما أقصرهم حجما ولكن بالأحرى أقواهم مغزى وحبكة.
لطالما كانت الرواية من وجهه نظر المحقق، الا اننا هنا يختلف الأمر تماما.
This is a great collection of short mysteries.
It seems to focus on extraordinary things happened to ordinary people, which I really loved.
I think the Listerdale mystery was my favorite story in this bunch and had the best and quite surprising ending.
I also loved the story with the "Marquess".
Even though Miss Marple and Poirot were absent, these were great stories by AC.
She has a wonderful talent for short story writing and includes as many twists and turns as possible!The audiobook for this novel was great and really brought life to each character.
I really enjoyed this collection of some of Agatha Christie's earlier short fiction.
Valoración: Bueno 😊Emociones: Satisfacción, nostalgia.Recomendado: Si te gustan los cuentos cortos, si ya has leído (y amado) a Agatha Christie.¿Volverías a leer a esta autora?: Es mi autora favorita y forma parte de mi re lectura, en orden cronológico, de sus obras.2018's Around the year in 52 books: #51, Short story collectionEsta es una colección de cuentos que no son de asesinato, son mas de temas cotidianos que involucran algún tipo de misterio.
Esta es una colección que a mi entender ha envejecido, los temas y misterios que plantea, en su mayoría, son muy ingenuos y hasta cierto punto inverosímiles.
Temanya masih pembunuhan, misteri dan cerita #romance kental.
Bayangkan saja, seorang wanita berusaha mengulur waktu dg bercerita.
Mana tetangga terdekat rumahnya bbrp mil..Cerpen keenam, Kecelakaan, twisted dan bikin syok.
Inspektur Evans masih sangat penasaran pada seorang wanita yg suami terdahulunya meninggal krn arsenik.
Kapten Haydock, sahabatnya, sudah memperingatkannya spy membiarkan yg sudah terjadi biarlah berlalu.
Kapten ini berprinsip untuk tidak mencampuri hal hal yg bukan urusannya.
Tp Evans masih bersikap curiga terang terangan pada si wanita, Mrs Merrowdene.
Evans percaya bakal terjadi pembunuhan lagi, apalagi skrg wanita itu bersuami lagi.
Kumpulan cerita ini tidak kalah apik dg novel full #agathachristie lainnya.Yah, namanya saja kumpulan cerita.
I do like that the stories were unpredictable - you don't know what kind of crime or mystery will be committed (unlike most of Christie's novels about murder), and you don't know whose perspective you're getting - the criminal, the sleuth, the hero - without Poirot or Miss Marple to set the stage. It's like a collection of short puzzles - not all super strong, but all fun.
تعجبني اغاثا في كتاباتها ..حقا اتسائل من اين لها هذه القدرة في الكتابة .. لغويا وعقليا من جميع النواحي ..تباغتك بأفكارها بشتى الطرق .. احببتها جدا :)
Korte verhalen. 'Het geheim van de spaanse kist' heb ik als aflevering van de tv serie gezien.
This is more of a collection of random Agatha Christie short mystery/suspense stories.
They were entertaining enough, but I found that most of them tended to revolve around the same few plot lines.
Then "The Rajah's Emerald" and "The Manliness of Edward Robinson" revolved around jewellery (it's always jewellery if it's not money or an inheritance in Agatha Christie) that are misplaced in the exact same manner.
The very similar plot lines and undeveloped characters lead me to wonder if these were almost a sort of reject pile for Agatha Christie.
Collection of short stories from reasonably early in Christie's career. Variable in quality. Illustrative of the mores of the time. Of necessity, given length, the characters are not as well drawn as is usual for Christie, nor are the plots as intricate - and several of the plots are quite samey.Fun, though. Amusing to find a story about James Bond in there.
Without spoiling anything, there is a trend in how several of these stories end...
Nice collection of short stories. Good choice if you don't have time to read a whole book.
These stories are quintessential Christie - pithy, witty, wry, and gay.
They take you back to the England of the 20s and 30s...even though I was never in England during the 20s and 30s.
;) Listening to these short stories back to back, however, alert you to some recurring tropes and plot devices that take a bit of the shine off.
Still, if you think Agatha Christie is all Poirot and Marple, this collection is a great way to expand your appreciation to this master of mystery.
This is a collection of short stories. I like Philomel Cottage and Accident... the crime had some interesting though not very complicated twists. Jane in search of a job is rather funny and has elements to be read faster. One curious thing; people advertise to buy teeth ?
Kumpulan kisah "misteri" yang kental romance-nya (^..^)Juga banyak yang kocak-kocak, yang bikin keinget sama cara bercerita P. G. Wodehouse (yang kalo ga salah, temennya Ms. Christie ^ ^)
This is an entertaining collection of short stories - none of which feature Christie's famous detectives.
Philomel Cottage, however, will send shivers down your spine.In this book Christie shows what a versatile writer she was.
Too many people dismiss her as being a lightweight detective story writer who wrote books featuring either an eccentric and fussy Belgian detective or a prissy spinster.
This collection of twelve short stories would be a good introduction to Christie's work and shows her at her versatile best.
Hugh Fraser is an excellent narrator in this and other audio editions of Christie's work.
Aaaaah yeees my first Spanish book, I'm so proud :D And what makes me the happiest is that I highly enjoyed this book!
I've always wanted to read an Agatha Christie book, and this was the perfect choice!
Agatha's way of writing is beautiful and it makes you feel like you're inside the mystery!
I've never read anything like it, I enjoyed it sooo much.
This book is basically a compilation of 10 short stories, all written by Agatha Christie, and they all have different characters and different mystery plot lines.
La esmeralda del rajá6.
La muchacha del tren 7.
La aventura del señor Eastwood9.
El canto del cisne
In a few cases, I am happy to say that Christie's usual art and flair shone through: 'Philomel Cottage' inspired a sense of terror in me comparable to 'And Then There Were None', while 'Swan Song' was a wonderful example of Christie's melding of known stories with her deadly mysteries.
However, these cases were few and far between, and with most of these stories bereft of the sumptuous ingenuity that were the hallmarks of the Marple and Poirot short stories, this collection only deserves its three-star rating by the slimmest of margins.
This was not one mystery. It was a collection of eleven short stories. In fact, there really weren't any mysteries in the collection. Instead each story was a cute little piece with a twist ending. I have to admit that I enjoyed every single one of them. They weren't deep, they weren't tricky, but they were all fun and entertaining. There were stolen jewels and poisonings and romance and mistaken identities. There were all the things that make Agatha Christie fun sprinkled throughout the collection. I enjoyed them immensely.
This is a collection of 12 short stories, each with its own charm and a twist. "The Listerdale Mystery" is the first of the short stories. I have read other GR reviews where people felt disappointed with the collection but they are enjoyable and you can read one quickly and move on. One criticism has been that each follows a formulaic plot, however this is definitely not the case for all the stories. My favourites were "Jane in search of a job" and "Swan Song", both very clever stories. I'm sure you will enjoy the collection!
I know my rating of this book suffered because of two things. One, I had previously read all but three of these stories and two, as a collection so many of the stories were similar as to ruin their appeal. Still, it is the master of the mystery genre writing them and most of them were really good. I was very partial to several of the stories, including Accident and Mr. Eastwood’s Adventure.
Maybe I am actually starting to develop a fondness for short story collections. Or maybe Agatha Christie is just that good. Either way, I found The Listerdale Mystery highly entertaining, with twelve really amusing short stories, none of which were disappointing. All twelve were well written, with different grades of mystery. Most stories had a nice touch of humor or irony as well.
Believe it or not, this is the first time I've read Agatha Christie, and I was not disappointed. This book of short stories is old-fashioned in the best sense of the word: classic, simple, almost entirely devoid of overt violence and sexuality, yet thrilling all the same. Some of the stories are more compelling than others, and the amount of danger and intrigue ranges greatly. All are worth a read, if only for the perfect pacing that Christie employs.
Really good! All 12 stories were very interesting, but my favorite ones were certainly Philomel Cottage, Accident (such an awesome twist) and the Swan Song (which actually reduced me to tears in the end). I shall certainly reread it and I advice it to anyone who likes short and, in some cases, silly stories. Quite romantic as well, in some cases! A must read.
Abiz liat trailer film Murder on The Orient Express jadi minat membaca lagi beberapa buku Agatha Christie yang masih banyak numpuk di rak.Kumpulan Kisah Tentang Lima Lamaran, Empat Pembunuhan, dan Tiga Penipuan.Dan setiap kali kasus selesai langsung terngiang lagunya Imagine Dragons "Believer". LOL.So Dope..angkat, lambaikan dan putar topimu untuk Agatha Christie
It's a decent sampling of Christie's short stuff. It's the right kind of thing to pick up when you feel like you want to read something, and be entertained, but not make a huge time commitment. The first story "The Listerdale Mystery" is my favorite out of the bunch because it's a little bit mystery and a charming wee romance.
