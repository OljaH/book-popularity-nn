داستان این مجموعه، به ترتیب زمان انتشار، پیش نمی‌رود، بلکه آسیموف، نخست جلد سوم از مجموعه را با عنوان: «بنیاد»؛ سپس جلد چهارم را با عنوان: «بنیاد و امپراطوری»؛ و پس آنگه جلد پنجم با عنوان: «بنیاد دوم» را، نوشتند؛ و سپس با وقفه‌ ای طولانی مدت، و بر اثر اصرار خوانشگران: جلد ششم با عنوان: «لبه بنیاد»؛ و سپس همین جلد هفتم را با عنوان: «بنیاد و زمین» را به مجموعه افزودند.
پس از آن، باز هم با وقفه‌ ای نسبتاً طولانی، جلد نخست مجموعه با عنوان: «سرآغاز بنیاد»؛ و در نهایت نیز اندکی پیش از درگذشت خویش، جلد دوم مجموعه را با عنوان: «پیشبرد بنیاد»؛ بنگاشتند.
The worst of all are the ridiculous storylines following his daughter, which are shoehorned in just to fill time and to give roundabout excuses for why sometimes Jack has to do things that no rational person would ever do, if they didn't have a child in trouble.At one point during one of the seasons, his daughter is hiking through the desert and gets caught in a bear trap and is being stalked by a mountain lion.Well, that is pretty much exactly what this entire book is.
The basic story arc is very simple, Trevize made a decision at the end of Foundation's Edge that will affect all of humanity.
However, why Trevize thinks he will find his answer on Earth is not clearly explained until the end of the book.If you are familiar with the Foundation series the lack of aliens in this space opera should come as no surprise to you.
That said, in the Foundation universe humanity work well enough together to colonize the entire galaxy, but there are some obvious signs of decay.Foundation and Earth is very readable and entertaining, it is not as tight or fast moving as the original Foundation books but it is also quite epic in scope in spite of focusing on just three main characters in a single linear plot line.
I had really enjoyed the plot and characters of "Foundation's Edge" and was looking forward to finishing up the series with this book.
Pelorat is as arcane and boring as Asimov is as a writer in this book.
For example: "Bliss did you control my/his mind?" "That child Follum is a pain" and "I am Bliss but I am also I/we/Gaia".
We get it the first time, but Asimov repeats these same dialogues like a broken record.The inane dialogue: In between the disappointing action scenes, which are few and far between, the characters speculate endlessly about unimportant things unrelated to the plot.
Reading about it online some people complain about the lack of an ending that satisfies questions brought up in the series but I think it ends splendidly.
I also felt that we have a great conclusion to the question of why Earth and Gaia, the purpose of the Seldon plan and what the Robots were doing and why.
I can't think of a better conclusion even 500 years before the end of the 1000 years "promised" us from the beginning.
If someone reads the entire series just to reach this point than it's a journey worth the effort.
So, the weakest part of the Foundation series is that Asimov's draws his characters so thinly, they might as well be cartoons.
Of course, when the story is spanning centuries and the main character is civilization itself, you don't mind so much.
Unfortunately, Foundation and Earth is the worst of all possible worlds.
Asimov even comments on how tedious the colloquies we get every time the ship departs from or approaches a planet are, which is really 90% of the story.
Finally, the thing about adding robots to the Foundation universe: I love robots, robots are cool, but robots don't add a single thing to these stories.
I really enjoyed this book, and am in awe of the way that Asimov pulled all the threads together to link his Foundation, Empire and Robot novels.
(If i'm wrong , please correct me as I would be very interested to read on).That said I thoroughly enjoyed the book and may well re-read the prequels now and the Asimov authorised (Brin, Benford, Bear) 2nd trilogy.
Here the story could progress for a long time without any discovery of interest being made, which may be the idea the characters were supposed to feel, but in other Foundation books it is what kept me hooked to reading them as the new information constantly unfolded.The ending was fairly poor as well.
I mean compare it to a book like Foundation and Empire, when it was revealed Magnifico was the Mule, and Asimov did such a good job of justifying it and making sense of it by looking at many oddities in the story.
Thank you Asimov for showing 'em how it's done!I suppose because there was so much time between the books being published (I wasn't born when the trilogy was published, and didn't know about Edge (#4) and Earth (#5) until years after I read the trilogy), I felt like I was ON that journey to find Earth.
4.5 StarsA good ending to the series.
Full of continuing mystery to the search for Planet Earth, the novel is complete adventure, as Asimov connects the series with his Robot series of titles.Somehow, although I did not find the ending excellent, it did satisfy me at certain points, and was good enough.
Loved the idea of Gaia, and a certain subtle layer of the storyline, pointing to our own planet as an organism, (possibly created by another set of beings), was indeed contemplative.
Lots of dialogues within the framework of the story takes several topics into consideration, and is food for thought to the reader.It was worth spending time reading the series till date.
Anyways, Asimov will always be a good choice for scifi and I just can't stop reading him.Asimov siempre tiene un toque que me atrapa en sus novelas, pero con esta entrega en la serie de Fundación si se me hizo difícil seguirle en muchas ocasiones, sobre todo en la primera mitad del libro.
Le tengo mucha mas fe a sus novelas de Robots ya que es lo que mas llama mi atención desde que se mencionaron en esta serie, dejare las precuelas de lado un momento y me centrare en esa línea de argumento mejor.
Creo que el final de Fundación y Tierra aunque tarda en llegar es muy sencillo y lindo.
Pre niekoho prozaická nuda, ale myšlienkovo je to celkom bohaté a zároveň podané ako ľahké čítanie.
Pohoda, klídek, tabáček a gravitačný pohon k tomu :) Človek má pocit, že odvedľa počuje kovové zvuky písacieho stroja a čaká, že Asimov si na chvíľu spraví pauzu a prisadne na slovíčko.Tento diel presne nadväzuje na predošlý 4.
Aj v rámci jednej knihy sú tu bežné skoky nielen priestorové, ale i generačné.
)Je to rozťahaný repetitívny text, ale ako "obedovo-čakárňová kniha" sa osvedčila.
(A pratchettovsky dodávam - kde je majonéza?)Záver je ako z inej galExie ušitý horúcou ihlou, určite v porovnaní so zvyškom textu.
diel (predohra série) dá odpoveď...
After finding that, after all the intervening years, #4 in the Foundation series had the same spirit as the original trilogy, the damp writing, lack of decent plotting and unlearning characters in #5 are a real let-down.Three characters – councilor Golan Trevize and historian Janov Pelorat, both from Terminus, and Bliss from the sentient world Gaia – zip around the galaxy looking for Earth, its existence erased form historical records.
The ramifications of how a sentient world would behave, while interesting in themselves and reflecting Asimov's subtle mind, are bogged down in the worst sort of Socratic dialoguing.
It's like the man who laid carpet in the bathroom and in the garage so it would be consistent with the rest of his home.
It doesn't diminish the original stories from the 50s like The Naked Sun or Foundation and Empire but it doesn't enhance them either.
I suppose writing it kept Asimov off the streets and out of trouble, at least for a while - you know what these old people are like given half a chance.Don't read this if you are new to Asimov and want to give him a go - try one of his works from the 50s instead.
Sure it doesn't involve minor characters, but good god, the whole damn thing feels like a set of boring, repeated discussions on the same set of inane topics and questions that aren't actually interesting.
Add up the fact that this reveal basically mimicked the reveal at the end of the last book and you've got a feeling of going back to the same stupid well again and again.Part of what I enjoyed about the first Foundation trilogy was its short story nature--things moved around, you never got all that attached to one character and what was at stake kept changing.
😳
The only reason why I'm giving this novel four and not five stars is that reading it wasn't a life-changing experience.
It was easy to get lost in the story and I did like the characters a great deal.
Some say that Asimov doesn't develops his characters well enough, but I beg to differ.
Sometimes these dialogues tend to get very philosophical even to the point of slowing the narrative, but I happen to like them.
I think dialogues and actions they take spoke loads about them, so no need for long descriptions and passages on their mind.I felt a sense of connection with the characters but also with the story.
Loved this one (again), although it is always sad to read the last book in a series you love… because then what?
The melancholy – or even sadness – feels akin to what it would be like discovering that your childhood home that you have so many great memories about has been abandoned, left to rot, even covered in graffiti… I can’t help the “How?
In all of that, there are references to stories in various books throughout the three series (which do in fact cover, all-in-all, 20,000 years of history in this universe).
I can however console myself with the fact that of all my favourite authors Dr Asimov was one of the most prolific in terms of fiction (second only to Georges Simenon) and there's still plenty more to read.I highly recommend reading these books in the suggested reading order provided by Asimov, the overall effect is extremely rewarding.
Asimov said in the beginning of this book that he never intended to write more foundation stories after the first 3 books.
Asimov just does not seem to be able to write long stories, he is not able to develop characters well enough to keep you interested in them once it gets to a point that they can't just be cardboard cut out stereotypes.
Foundation and Earth is a sequel to, and should be read after, Foundation's Edge.
It is supposedly a continuation of the famous Foundation trilogy, written decades earlier, and so it is, but only loosely so.
During their adventures they visit the planets of Aurora and Solaria, both from the robot series of novels, and even mention one of the books by name - Caves of Steel.
Eventually, they meet Daneel Oliva, the android from the robot series, now 20,000 years old.
Foundation and Earth is more of a continuation of Asimov's robot series than it is the Foundation trilogy.There was one thing left unresolved, in my mind at least.
Book four, written 30 years after the first three, had a rather abrupt ending, and unsatisfied questions - where is Earth?
Unfortunately, it does so with a meandering plot, openly fractious characters and somewhat tenuous connections to the rest of Isaac Asimov's books - most importantly the Robots series.
Not only were openly hostile characters not fun to read, they were not fun for a lot of pages!Next up would be some of the prequels, though I am in no rush to start them at this point.
My advice for the Foundation series so far has to remain - read only the first three books.

Terribly disappointing end to an entertaining series. Supposedly smart people acting as insufferable morons, spouting some of the clunkiest dialogue I've ever read. The endless exposition could be forgivable, but to add insult to injury I was bored throughout. It is so bad that it lessens the series as a whole. I wish I'd never read it.
Un, lungo, affascinante e suggestivo, viaggio alla ricerca delle origini dell'umanità...Magico!
"Fundação e Terra" pode ser considerado o capítulo final de uma série de livros cujo início ocorre por meio dos contos de "Eu, Robô", evoluindo depois, em ordem cronológica de desenvolvimento das histórias para a série Robôs/Elijah Baley ("Cavernas de aço", "O sol desnudo", "Robôs da alvorada" e "Robôs e Império"), a série Império Galático ("As correntes do espaço", "Poeira de estrelas" e "Pedra no céu"), a série Trilogia da Fundação ("Fundação", "Fundação e Império" e "Segunda Fundação") e, por fim, a extensão da série Fundação ("Prelúdio à Fundação", "Origens da Fundação", "Limites da Fundação" e "Fundação e Terra").Tal introdução é necessária, pois que, para a melhor compreensão de "Fundação e Terra", a leitura, ao menos, da série Robôs/Elijah Baley e da Trilogia da Fundação, além, é claro, do livro anterior, "Limites da Fundação" torna-se um ganho expressivo.
O concluzie frumoasă poveștii Fundației. Deși finalul era cumva de așteptat, plăcerea de a citi modul în care se leagă toate nodurile dezlegate din poveștile celelalte ale universului Asimov, plecând de la ”O piatră pe cer” și terminând cu ultima din seria Roboții, Funația și Pământul arată cum Asimov a ales să-și respecte fanii. Tratat individual, romanul are o valoare decentă, mai ales în contextul în contextul este perfect legată de ”Marginea fundației”.Și totuși, parcă în continuare așteptam ceva mai mult, deși e bine și așa.
Fuck, the ending!
but i had never read the robot stories or books, or the galactic empire novels, or prelude and forward...So here we are.
there was something intensely appealing about the mysteries of the planets and of the final quest and question this book endeavors to answer and explore.The ending: (SPOILERS NEXT)The irony that the last of the spacer worlds, Solaria, was the deliverer of salvation for the conglomerate entity, Gaia and all of humanity(so the conclusion suggests), is wonderful!
is simply astonishing.I loved the feel of this book as they visited the long lost spacer worlds of Aurora, Solaria, and Melpomenia.
But actually I wish Asimov hadn't written it.
This (and the first) is all I could stomach of the Foundation series.
I, too, preferred the Robot books over the Foundation.
But if you want to see what eventually happens to the Spacer worlds, there is one book you'll have to read: Foundation and Earth (Foundation #5)....
This book is unlike any other Foundation book and is the last novel that Asimov wrote....
In it, the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series all meet and reveal themselves to be in the same universe.
I couldn't read it fast enough."Rachel Adiyah, Evolution of SF Group
