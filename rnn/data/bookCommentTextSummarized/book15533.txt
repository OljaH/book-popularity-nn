Hi, my name is Katerina and I am addicted to Bridgertons.I've been dreaming of balls, banquets and gowns since I was a little girl, historical romance is my sanctuary from the small and big disappointments of daily life (i.e. work - read - sleep - repeat), and during 2018 I've written more 3star reviews than my entire life.I would appreciate some help.Thank you.  “In her heart she longed for this man, dreamed of a life that could never be.”   Now, before I start rambling on the wonderful moments
Hi, my name is Katerina and I am addicted to Bridgertons.I've been dreaming of balls, banquets and gowns since I was a little girl, historical romance is my sanctuary from the small and big disappointments of daily life (i.e. work - read - sleep - repeat), and during 2018 I've written more 3star reviews than my entire life.I would appreciate some help.Thank you.
Now, before I start rambling on the wonderful moments I expecienced when I followed Sophie and Benedict's journey, I need to state that those three starts you see above do not mean I didn't enjoy An Offer From a Gentleman, because I did.
Benedict Bridgerton wants Sophie with a burning passion.
I mean.......isn't it SO romantic when a man wants to have sex with you all the time (basically make you his whore) while at the same time planning to marry and have babies and appear publicly with another "high class"woman?
I don't care if this was a reality of the day -- it is NOT romance to me.
To make matters worse, he doesn't understand and is angry that she doesn't accept his offer (NOT a gentlemanly one BTW) and be grateful to be taken care of financially and safe by that arrangement.
I am loving this series and this is my favourite so far!
Sophie and Benedict are such charming characters and I loved the banter between the two of them.The story is a retelling of Cinderella, right down to the wicked step mother, the sisters (not ugly although one has an ugly nature!) and having to leave the ball on the stroke of midnight.
I enjoyed every minute of it especially when Araminta gets her just desserts.The Bridgertons are such a wonderful family it is fun whenever they appear.
For a Georgette Heyer tragic like me it is a real pleasure to have discovered this author and especially this series of books:)
She has an amazing way to draw you into the story from the first few pages and you’re smiling from the get-go right up to the end :) She even manages to take you on a sudden heart-breaking emotional roller coaster ride that really gives you the chills and makes you want to cry for the h/h as a couple.
This contrasts so well with the rest of the light-hearted story making the situation all the more poignant.
Makes you just sigh every time he says and does something –oh ya and then there’s his tenacity!
Overall, it's still a 5-star read for me, but the heroine's refusal to just tell the hero her secret drove me nuts!Original Review from Sept'2010: 5+ stars – Historical/Regency RomanceAn Offer From a Gentleman might be a Cinderella-like story, but it’s much more than just a fairytale remake.
Benedict and Sophie and the supporting cast are all remarkable, lovable characters to cheer for.
5 Big, sweet fairytale stars!
I loved this Benedict quote:It suddenly made sense.
He’d thought it remarkable, to have found two, when in his heart he’d always believed there was only one perfect woman out there for him.
«Puedo vivir con tu odio - dijo a la puerta cerrada - pero no puedo vivir sin ti».«Hay muchos motivos para amarte - le dijo, marcando cada palabra con esmerada precisión. - Pero una de las cosas que más me gustan - continuó - es que te conoces. Sabes quién eres y lo que vales. Tienes principios, Sophie, y te atienes a ellos. - Se llevó una mano a los labios para besarla -. Eso es muy excepcional.»  Por un lado tenemos a Benedict, otro de los hermanos Bridgerton, otro más de los solteros más co
Por el otro tenemos a Sophie, bastarda de un conde, pero no reconocida más que como una pupila, es tratada nada más que como una sirvienta ahora que su padre se ha casado con una viuda con dos hijas.
Fue increíble lo rápido que leí esta historia pero supongo que eso es lo normal cuando te tiene tan enganchada y en vilo por saber que pasa conforme pasas las páginas.
Así que como lo he disfrutado tanto me lanzo de cabeza ahora mismo a por Colin.
It is one of my favorites of the series, also got a place of my all-time favorites shelf!It is a Cinderella story with charming characters, perfect plot and character delineation, twists and turns, adorable and moving romantic scenes, sweet and funny moments.Although it is based on a fairy tale, the emotions and relationships are presented in a realistic way.I love Benedict, he is my favorite Bridgerton!
He is persevering, sincere, and very romantic.
I didn’t agree with her last decision, when she (view spoiler)[left the Bridgerton house (hide spoiler)], but the final scene makes up for it - it is amazing beyond expectations.
She'd have likely just been nastier and worked Sophie harder, but she was furious when Benedict came to the home to "meet her daughters" in an effort to ferret out his mystery woman Sophie had left a glove behind that was monogrammed with her dead grandmother's initials, giving him a clue to her origin.
It made for some great angst.Of course, this is a romance and we get the big reveal, which exposed Sophie as the mystery lady from the ball and revealed to the world that she was actually a gently raised "ward" of the dead earl who'd had her dowry stolen by the evil countess and not a servant.
This one was adorable, sweet and, specifically the first hundred pages, enchanting.

It broke my heart to see Benedict's struggling with his own feeling, torns between what he feels for Sophie and the mysterious lady without knowing he's falling in love with the same woman twice.
There's Benedict's love to the mysterious woman which he must let go, Sophie's secrets to be revealed, and most important of all is their love is forbidden.
A nakon još nekoliko mjeseci je shvatio kako ponovno može upoznavati žene, ne uspoređujući ih nesvjesno s njom.No nije ju mogao prestati tražiti pogledom.
Jednostavno nije mogao prestati tražiti pogledom.
Sviđa mi se kako je autorka emotivno opisala njihov prvi susret i kako je on godinama uticao na Benedicta, čak i tokom njegove romanse sa Sophie - on ne shvata da je ona maskirana dama koju je upoznao na balu."I odjednom je sve imalo smisla.
Doista je postojala samo jedna."Put do srećnog kraja nije bio lak za oboje.
It offers an interesting twist on the original love story in which there is always a twist.Benedict and Sophia are both such lovable characters.
This novel was fun, adventurous and absolutely heart-racing.Ms. Quinn really paid attention to every small detail and while reading I feel myself being taken to another time and place and I would hate to be the family member to disturb such a time.
I loved how tough Sophie was and how smart she was and at the same time show how utterly naughty Benedict was.In summary this story was a great fairytale.
Wow. Not only do I believe the love at first sight between Sophie and Benedict from Moment Nr. 1 on, but there is just the right amount of a magic feeling that makes it a delight to read.
We have everything essential to the original story, but added to it two realistic, human main characters and authentic side characters (not to mention that the side characters are mostly all the other Bridgertons, who are all adorable in their own way).Sophie and Benedict are my favourite couple so far, and although this is only the third in the series that I've read, I must warn the other Bridgertons that once I find my faves, I don't let them go easily.
Τι γλυκό,η ιστορία του Μπένεκτιτ ήταν μέχρι στιγμής η πιο όμορφη!Ελπίζω στο επόμενο να μάθουμε την ταυτότητα της λαίδης Γουισλντάουν,αν και κάτι υποψιάζομαι ;)
Sophie and Benedict have to overcome a large gap in social status and revealing truths in order to reach their happy ever after..
He was charming and sometimes heartbreaking, it torn at my heart as he deals with his feelings toward Sophie and his masked lady in silver.
While both were great, I felt the true bump in a other wise perfect story was the fact of Benedict forcing the issue of the Sophia, a maid becoming his mistress.
While Sophia kept the truth of her being the masked lady in silver and secret for so long.
That was before I knew the hero was going to turn out to be an ass.)The hero is the second Bridgerton son, Benedict.
So, while she really REALLY wants to schtup our hero, she says no.
He says "well surely you can't expect me to marry you!" ASS.
By this time I was so completely disgusted with him that I couldn't possibly be happy for them.Hmm I was going to give this 2 stars, but I just got so worked up writing this review, remembering how awful he was to her, how he pressured her relentlessly for sex ...

4,5 Gentle Stars	Benedict (yes, the second brother.) meets a mysterious girl at a masquerade party.
But not only they are from different social circles (and that was apparently a huge thing in the regency) but he is still waiting for the mysterious girl in silver who stole his heart two years ago.
Sophie knows she can never tell him that she is the girl in silver.
But as their love grows she knows he will eventually find out.
Again, a wonderful couple that fought for their love way more than the others before, and just for that, they made this book an amazing story to read.
Assim como todos os seus irmãos, nosso mocinho também enfrentava a pressão da mãe para casar-se rapidamente e estabelecer sua própria família, só que o bondoso rapaz não tinha interesse por nenhuma garota de seu ciclo social e limitava cada vez mais suas interações nos bailes e festas organizados pela matriarca.
Após 20 anos sujeitando-se a todo tipo de trabalho escravo dentro da mansão mantida por sua madrasta Araminta, Sophie (com a ajuda das outras empregadas) teve a oportunidade de viver uma única noite mágica ao entrar indevidamente no baile da família Bridgerton para dançar e se apaixonar perdidamente por Benedict (seu verdadeiro príncipe encantado).
A menina pobre que vai ao baile, conhece o príncipe, apaixonam-se à primeira vista e ficam juntos por causa de um sapato [um mísero sapato!] não me convence minimamente!Mas o que é que a Cinderela tem a ver com este livro?
Só Julia Quinn teve a capacidade de pegar em algo que odeio com cada fibra do meu ser e transformá-la em algo que eu amo.Há a menina pobre que vai ao baile e conhece o amor da sua vida, há a saída apressada à meia-noite, há a madrasta má e as duas meias-irmãs...
Not the Quinn I expectedSetting / Time / Genre: Regency EnglandLength: 421 pages.
Plan on reading more by the author:  Yeppers.Synopsis in one sentence or slightly more: Heroine is a bastard, there I said it.
Hero thinks she is a maid, hires her, wants her, makes the mistress offer, and things happen.
At the same time she is loving and lovable.
So, perhaps he is a little less than ok.
I mean he's trying to make this awesome person his mistress.
In fact, he's more like the second Bridgerton, after all.
A fun read, just not up to her usual.
Sophie is sweet and spunky.
I loved that Benedict spent three years searching for Sophie after their initial meeting at the masquerade ball.
The confrontation between Benedict's mother, Violet Bridgerton, and Araminta (Sophie's wicked step-mother) when Violet comes to Sophie's rescue is awesome.
A tiny part of me felt sorry for Araminta's youngest (and less-loved) daughter, Posy.
While she wasn't smart enough to speak up for herself, she was still friendly and warm-hearted at times towards Sophie.I would have enjoyed more humor in this book and more glimpses of the other Bridgerton siblings, but I suppose that's why there are more books in the series.
Que la historia beba tanto del cuento de la Cenicienta me echó bastante para atrás.
The wicked stepmother, also comes with two evil stepsisters.
The wicked stepmother of course keeps this from our beloved heroine, and Sophie is employed or rather turned into a slave since she doesn’t get paid for her services as everything.
One night, the Bridgertons were to host a masquerade ball, and all but Sophie is going.
Unfortunately, after the night, Benedict looses the lady in the silver gown, and only meets Sophie two years later without any idea that Sophie is the woman he’s been looking for ever since.This book may be a Cinderella retelling at first, but it’s something more.
La historia es un cuento de Hadas clásico de la cenicienta, tenía todos los elementos y fueron muy bien llevados y adaptados al romance histórico.A mí más que los personajes fue la historia la que me enamoró.
En cuanto a Bennedith me gustó pero no me llegó tan profundo había acciones en las que quería darle un par de golpes por idiota😡👊, por su cobardía y egoísmo, tal vez sea la época y ese era el modo de actuar de los hombres pero de todas maneras no hay justificación.Y los demás Bridgerton Colin si que me caló  hondo 😍💕❤😍 y espero que su libro no me decepcione porque tengo muy altas las expectativas
I expected that to warp the story more than it did but it was relatively benign, all told.Like Cinderella, Sophie's defining characteristic is being a victim.
She's not a complainer or anything, but man her life sucked and being cheerful in the face of that would have been expecting a bit much.Benedict, on the other hand, is not a prince, is not charming, and spends most of the story bullying Sophie to get what he wants.
I kept waiting for a light to go off in his head for every new thing he learns about Sophie's life so far.
Another great addition to the Bridgerton Series✯✯✯✯.I have to admit, the Cinderella trope is not one of my favorite fairy tale retelling. But this one is definitely one of the best I've read.Sophia Beckett was the illegitimate daughter of the Earl of Penwood whom he claimed as a ward but didn't really acknowledge her in any meaningful way. When the Earl remarried, his new wife Countess Araminta brought her two daughters Rosamund and Posy into the household and quickly put Sophia on notice as to
But this one is definitely one of the best I've read.Sophia Beckett was the illegitimate daughter of the Earl of Penwood whom he claimed as a ward but didn't really acknowledge her in any meaningful way.
It was sad, painful and thus began Sophia's longing for affection and a family connection.The Bridgerton's annual masquerade ball was the most sought after invitation in all of the ton, and the household staff helped Sophia sneak into the ball since her face was covered.
The rest of the story was Benedict's search of the masked lady who enchanted his soul at his family's masquerade ball.Rosalyn Landor's narration always transports me to that old regency period.
Nuestra reseña en A la cama con... un libro
I didn't think this kind of book would be my thing, but I found it a quick and easy read.
I liked the MCs and hated the wicked stepmother, as you do.
I also liked that (view spoiler)[ Sophie did remain illegitimate and yet the author found a way to make it acceptable for them to marry.
I was half-anticipating the author crumbling and making her parents actually have a secret marriage so she was really legitimate (as I've read in a couple of other books).
I'm glad the author didn't take this easy 'cop-out'.
(Okay, so I knew what was going to happen, that's the whole point of reading romance novels, but you know what I mean.)An Offer From a Gentleman is the third of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton books, and it's basically a re-telling of Cinderella* (with some variations, of course).
At which point they meet again, and Sophie doesn't tell him who she is.I really liked this book.
The appearances from the Bridgerton clan are kept well in control, which is nice, because these types of family saga romance series can easily get to cutesy and reliant on appearances from previous books' characters.
As much as the debonair Benedict looked around in the weeks following, he could never find the woman who captured his heart.Sophie was born a bastard.
That’s why she kept her identity a secret during her one stolen night…bastards mingling with the aristocratic echelon is a big fat no-no…plus she would be in for it big-time if her wicked stepmother ever found out.Although Sophie wasn’t legitimate, she was gently raised as a lady, but known to the outside world as the earl’s ward.
When he marries a woman with 2 daughters, she hoped to gain a loving family at last, but got stuck with an evil stepmother.
