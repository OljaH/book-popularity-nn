I am changing the designation of this book to 'reference' as I don't ever expect to be finished reading this!
For my GR's shelving purposes, 'reference' books never get a specific date-finished as I never really 'finish' with them.><><><><><><><><><><><><><><Have read parts of this off and on for the past couple of years.
Perhaps one could just read this book, but I think the whole point is to learn 'the ways of mental prayer' so as to begin practicing the disciplines described by the author.
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><Recommended by Brother André Marie in his 8 CD series on The Practice of Mental Prayer some of which is found in this on-line article.
This book I read on and off for about a year, yet this book is most impressive in its scope on the ways of mental prayer, this is a book though that I believe you will need to read in bits and piece, incrementally letting it digest in your mind and heart because it is indeed a profound manual on deeper forms of prayer.
When I was younger, I thought prayer was simply vocal prayer, but after reading this book all I can say is, don't let people tell you that prayer must always and only involves ones mouth, its not true, and not only is it not true it is also the lowest kind of prayer there is too.
My Synopsis: This book is worth reading, however it requires persistence and it addresses the ways of prayer.
I'd say that this book should be read a 2nd time and one may even want to summarize it so that what is learned can be put into practical practice.
Conversion and Prayer:There is a great deal that can be discussed, yet I want to quote pg.
Prayer gives us a means of conversion and certitude in this world.
If God gives, it is for the end of our conversion.
This was a dense and difficult read, but it was fantastic. My first thought as I finished was how much I wanted to go back and read it again, because it made the various levels of prayer (all the way up to the transforming union) within the realm of possibility. Which was really exciting! The fifteen minutes or so per day that I took to read through this slowly over the past four and half months was not only educational, but good material for meditation. It's not for everybody, but I am so very grateful to have received the recommendation.
Filled with valuable information, but a very dry read. The first half was a breeze to get through. The last half could only be consumed a little at a time. It is one of those books that must be considered slowly, one cannot plow through it quickly unless one is enlightened by grace.God willing, in a few years, I will try to read it again and see if it easier to read.
PrayerI found this work hard to read. It is a powerful expose on how to pray meaningfully. I have learned many new thoughts on praying the mental frame of mind to be in when talking to God. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pray more meaningfully.
Very clear. So helpful in really getting to understand it.
