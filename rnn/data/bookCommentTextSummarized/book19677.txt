This book was, like, so lame and I think the previous book (Dark Reunion) should have been the best ending for the Vampire diaries, but no...How could that be?
I was so happy that Stefan wasn't in the half of this book or he would have ruined it...Damon...He was so good except for what the author made him do or say >.< Mutt?
Full Story: Elena is a kiddo and then she turns back while people out there thinks shes still dead and Stefan is acting like her mom all the time.
I am so saddened by this novel.
I have been an avid LJS fan since 1995 and my favorite series is The Vampire Diaries.
I loved the characters and the story.
was a jumble of words that literally made NO sense.
There were concepts that did not hold true to the original series (such as the vampire powers) and characters were doing things they would never do.
The hell?!Anyway, I have not finished this book.
I will, but I need to set it aside.
This book has the pleasure of joining only one other novel on my pick-up-set-down shelf.
Such a disappointment.
What a garbled bunch of nonsense.
Maybe I don't remember the writing accurately - I fell in love with these books when I was a kid - or maybe it's gotten worse.
Makes me embarrassed I've been trying to get my kids to read this series instead of Twilight.
If I had to read Stefan call Elena "love" one more time...or witness, yet again, what awesome friends Matt and Meredith and Bonnie are to Elena despite the fact that she's seriously one of the most selfish characters ever...augh.
Hopefully my memory's accurate and they're better than this sludge.
I shall consider this book "inspired by The Vampire Diaires".
You can't write fanfiction when they're your own characters, can you?
Because I don't know what else to call this.
There were a few bits of new information and a scene here and there that I really, really enjoyed.
The writing style was just...wtf.
WTF.
Normally, Smith's writing style is very clear and concise, and this was haphazard and slap-dash.
I can't even give this a number of stars because I don't know what to think.
In my book journal I gave it a grade of Not Applicable.
Two kitsune are the main antagonists, infecting our anti-hero Damon, and wreaking chaos in the small town of Fell's Church.
Damon nearly forces Matt and Elena to act out a rape, Meredith is nearly made to fork her own tongue, and Bonnie is attacked by returning antagonist Caroline Forbes doing her best impersonation of Regan from The Exorcist.But there is also a lot of beauty in this book, particularly in a scene with Damon and Elena in Honoria Fell's tomb, in Stefan's pure love for Elena, and in the strong friendship between Elena, Bonnie, and Meredith.
Overall, this book is kicking off a new arc in the story of these characters.
Like many other readers here, I first read The Vampire Diaries series as a teenager, and really enjoyed it.
But rather than continuing a series that readers loved so much, and taking the characters in a direction that just doesn't fit with the original books, why did the author not create new characters and a new world and write a new series that fits with her current writing style?
I may try again when I've gotten over the disappointment of the book being so different from the rest of the series, but I would encourage those who truly loved the earlier books to avoid this one.
They will likely end up disappointed as well.
Spike and Damon; however, are nothing a like in my opinion.
I liked Spike, but I love Damon.
I might have been the only person who was happy when Buffy and Spike ended up together (or maybe not), anyway I'm hoping if these characters and author are anything a like, then I can hope that Elena and Damon will find their perfect happiness (together).
I'm not sure what to do about Stefan.Hopefully Fell's Church doesn't end up like a big hole in the ground like Sunnydale.
It didn't always bother me, but there were times I was like, "lets move it along"...
That was, um, weird. 🤔
When Elena sacrificed herself to save the two vampire brothers who love her—the handsome, brooding Stefan and the sleek and dangerous Damon, she was consigned to a fate beyond death until a powerful supernatural force pulled her back.
Lastly, Elena's healing and flying powers all have thematic names, which she yells out as she's executing them: “Wings of Purification!” and “Wings of Redemption!" Cue anime music please.Did I forget to mention the angry sentient trees from the angry Old Wood that has suddenly appeared in Fell's Church as though it's been there all along?
And giant invisible insects made of jell-o that seems to be causing a rash of possessions in Fell's Church?As for this being a more "adult" L.J. Smith--I could not disagree more.
This is L.J. Smith's next (Book number 5) in her Vampire Diaries series.
Now, after 18 years, L.J. Smith has written a fifth book in the series.
The first 100 pages or so are written in a completely different style, the rest of the book is more like her writing.
However, overall this is a very dark book and is written in a more “adult” fashion.
It think this new book, and the other two to follow need to be judged separately from Ms. Smith’s original four.
This book is very different.
It was so bad that I was like, what the hell did I just read.
(In fact, I made a 'what-the-hell-did-i-just-read' shelf just for this book lol).The story was so lame and stupid...I can't even explain how lame it is.
Honestly nothing in the book made sense.
-.- And then stupid Stefan acting like he's Elena's mom?
*rolls eyes*But then again Mutt or Matt, I don't see the difference much either when reading this book..he was just plain weird here.
It's worse than the lamest Wattpad book I've read.
All I've left to say to the TVD show lovers..save yourselves and don't read this book!
I'm sure she's just going home to get some Midol, NOT TO SATAN'S LAIR.Also, you have committed the cardinal sin of vampire novels, BY INTRODUCING FAIRIES AS AN ANTAGONIST.
Vampires are big, bad, and scary.
There is no rivalry between them, because vampires would eat fairies for breakfast if they would stop giggling and flitting around long enough.
But this isn't your gravest sin, LJ Smith.
Your greatest sin is that you have completely eliminated ANY hope of Damon/Elena or even Stefan/Elena sexual tension by gleefully informing us that your vampires cannot have sex.
I must say that I did enjoy this book, but there were many distrubing elements to it.
This series is geared to a young adult audience, but I would not want my teen to read this book.Stefan is lured from Elena as the town is falling apart.
This book has two "malach" who are trying to destroy the town.
In the seduction area, it doesn't go into too much detail, but the images are very stong in the other.I think that an adult can handle this book and see where it is going enough to enjoy it, but it is for mature audiences only.
I wonder if Smith knew what she was writing.Words which made no sense, For example ''Wings of Redemption'', ''Wings of Purification''.Exactly what does these words mean?!
The characters really gets into our nerves.Stefan is really pathetic.
The way he calls elena ''My love'' is really annoying.
Elena is the same.As a spirit, she did some crazy stuff.Bonnie,as usual was over dramatic .Damon is the only sane one remaining in the group.But Smith ruined his character too.Though this book was a disaster, i will be reading the next book in the series.
With stefan out of the way,i am hoping for some delena moments.
oh god i cant tell you how bad this book was, it was SO BAD!!i had to keep forcing myself to read it, it was that bad - i dont know what smith was thinking - she should have stopped writing these books and left it as it was, Elena sacrifced herself for a good cause, there was no point to bringing her back.
Egh just egh - the story line was really really shit - watch out everyone for *contain spoiler* EVIL PARACITES that will get into your head and mess you up!
Yer it gets worse, stefan getting off on Elenas blood which is soo good cause shes got spiritual powers!!!
I don't think I've ever read any other book series that is so inferior to its tv adaptation.
If I'd started reading the books before watching the TV show, I probably wouldn't have gotten more than 20% of the way through the first novel.
But it wouldn't be fair to forgive so much based on a stellar TV adaptation.In all honesty, this is a 2 star book.
And my particular pet peeve is that a large portion of Elena's inner dialogue always seems to be dedicated to questioning whether or not she should trust Damon in Every.
Book Elena can do better than both of them.
I've waited more than 10 years for this book, having started the series my freshman year in college.
I wasn't expecting great literature- but this was very bad.
It's like LJ Smith took a page from the Stephenie Meyer guide on how-to-screw-up-a-good-series.
The characters seem nothing like the original books, and the chemistry between them has disappeared.
Awakening:Nightfall reads like bad fanfiction (it must be contagious.) It feels like Smith tries to cram every fairy-tale/folklore myth into this novel, and the result is a long, repetitive and wordy mess: how many times can a tree try to strangle you?
Poor Damon! Poor Stefan!
I think I got to page 57 when I just couldn't continue. And it takes a lot for me to not finish a book!
More mentions were made of adult situations, more nakedness happened and Caroline ended up pregnant for an encounter with Tyler that supposedly took place during Dark Reunion.
Edgy seemed to be the kitsune having red tipped hair.This book took place a week or so after the end of Dark Reunion.
I had honestly thought Caroline had grown at the end of the 4th book, but apparently not.Elena starts as a mostly spirit, unable to function as a teen girl but with full use of White Magic.
The book ended with Elena, Damon and Matt going to search for him.
When the big Twilight craze hit and I heard the premise, my first thought was "But it was Stephen and Elena, not Edward and Bella." After reading Twilight, I reread this series and was happy to discover I still loved it.So I was absolutely ecstatic when I found out this new book was being added to The Vampire Diaries series.
Elena is back, but not quite human at the beginning of the book (and I don't think she is by the end of it either) and is definitely experiencing rebirth pains.
I definitely feel the characters are evolving and they are up against some pretty nasty new bad guys.
Because this book was ridiculous.At the end of the last book, Elena had been turned into a vampire, then killed, then brought back from the dead six months after actually dying.
Everything's great except Caroline is acting very weird and Damon got bit by something in a tree and suddenly all hell breaks loose.
Apparently, some random Japanese fox demons named Shinishi and Misao were drawn to Fell's Church because of Elena's weird powers.
Then suddenly Elena's an angel with all these powers and Wings of Redemption?
But obviously I will not be reading the rest of the Vampire Diaries: The Return series.
That being said, Vampire Diaries was never my favorite of her series.
Trying to follow and support a character you hate is hard.What was worse was that I actually enjoyed the end of book 4, Dark Reunion.
She is the epitome of what I hated growing up, and those stupid girls that some of us loathe because they blink and six men run up to them.But what I love most of all is Damon Salvatore.
A sexy, dark haireOf course, Damon's constant flaw has always been that he's wanting Elena.
The bathroom scene cracked me up because frankly that's what I wanted in the original books--I wanted Damon and Bonnie together.
Cost: Unknown Title:  Nightfall Series:  Vampire Diaries: The Return #1 Author:  LJ Smith Overall Rating:  2.7 starsNO.
This is a series that should have ended with Dark Reunion.
This book was just so boring.
I couldn't care less about Elena, I didn't even like her that much in the original books, never mind this new version of her.
The only bearable character in this series is Stefan.
I could have read this book in like an hour, but because it was so boring, I had to keep coming back and forwards to it.
just found myself not caring about any of the characters, especially Caroline.
But in this book, it seemed like LJ couldn't make up her mind whether she wanted Damon to be good or bad.
In this book, I feel like Damon's a teensy bit out of character.
I don't know, I had an odd feeling everytime I was reading about Damon in this book.
I've read the small blurbs on LJ's site, and it looks like we're gonna have to go through two more books of Elena's "OH STEFAN.
The people you care about the most may betray you utterly.Bonnie, Meredith and Matt, who is good friends with all of the main characters and is also Elena's ex-boyfriend and a potential love interest for Bonnie, have been attacked and badly hurt during a car accident.
Will Elena find Stefan with Damon and Matt aiding her or will she fail?
Will Damon have the willpower to fight the darkness inside of him and choose good or will he succumb to this unknown enemy's way and hurt the people he loves?
It definitely did not disappoint and left me wanting more of Elena, Stefan, Damon, Matt, Bonnie and Meredith.
Poor continuation of the seriesIt was only after the CW picked this up as a show that I started reading THE VAMPIRE DIARIES last month.
The lack of continuity, poor writing, limited character development, and an entirely too long narrative combined for a very unsatisfying read.
For the plot covered, the book is entirely too long at nearly 600 pages.
The book is entirely focused on the characters' continual attempts to save themselves or others from more malicious things that want to get them.
The author seemed to want to ratchet up the horror factor by including non-stop attacks on Elena and Co., but it felt very contrived.
At the beginning The Return: Nightfall, she had to start a new life with Stefan in secret (since most of the town people thought that she's dead) But for some reason Elena wasn't just a mere human anymore, after returning from The Other Place, now she possesses awesome psychic Power and her blood drew the vampires in like honey to the bees.
Smith thought she was being creative to add colorful, outlandish characters such as Shinichi and Misao from Japan into the picture; but to me they just more or less spoil the whole story.Then Damon, the badass, ruthless vampires from the previous books, also lost his cool and being reduced into helpless puppet by the evil kitsune twins.
Oh dear.
I don't even know where to start.
This book was all over the place and it can't hold a candle to the original series from the 90s.
The story pretty much picks up where "Dark Reunion" left off and the original series is set in the 90s!
But I take offense if all the characters act like complete morons (even Damon) for most of the story, which is even worse if the reader knows what's going on.
"Oh hey, Damon!
I don't even know what to say to the horrific Elena storyline.
By far the worst of the series.
It's like she felt the need to continue a series that would have been better off had she not...just because they made a TV show out of it.
This book is all over the place, it left me wondering what the hell was going on.
Damon is all over the place, the characters don't sound like they did in the first books which makes this so much harder to read.
It feels like the writing level of these books was far below those first four.1/5 stars, do not read.
