But with my super special unicorn powers I can get there myself, although it was said that that's impossible!Aldertree: YOU GOING TO JAIL!!Simon: Crap, but I guess someone will get me out of jail soon...*300 pages later*...hello?Sebastian/Jonathan: Hello, I'm a new character introduced only to make sense of this mess.
We learn that Sebastian/Jonathan is actually Valentins son and Jace is the son of that Stephen guy.
Also, Clary and Jace got the blood of the same angel in them, which sort of still makes them related, but WHO CARES?!?!?
Action packed from the beginning to the end.
This book is full of revelations, returns and deaths.
The only problem I had with this book, the big reveal was pretty obvious by about page 200 but she still tried to keep it a mystery.A great book, and a seemingly a definitive ending to the moral instruments, so I am curious as to what the next book will be about.
Maybe the start of a second trilogy.
However if you read the first two book you must read this one.
Everything that was missing from the second book is in this one.
I promised myself I wasn't going to write a spoiler review though I  really  wanted to.
Without giving spoilers I can't stress how much a certain line did this or what took me by surprise but y'all are just going to have to read it to feel and see what I felt.EVERYTHING is finally explained.
I can see that now!" Definitely is the best of the series and not only because of the plot and resolution, but because of the development of the characters.
I want to gush and gush over everything but I had to say Valentine seemed to fit into the series finally.
At this point I'm most likely not going to continue with the Mortal Instruments series. Sometime in the future I might, but for now I'm leaving it here.
I'm enthralled with the stories of these young characters in this paranormal world.
All of them pulled me deeper into this story and left me craving more.Action was also plentiful in this book.
The dynamics are constantly changing as new characters and relationships are revealed.
Of course, this book leaves just as many questions unanswered as you had going into it.
This was no big surprise, since this book is in the middle of the series with plenty more to follow.Overall, I thought it was a great continuation of this series.
I enjoyed every minute of this rapidly changing story.
After all that's been going on with Cassie Clare lately I can't have this on my page anymore. Sorry peeps!
***LAST AND FINAL EDIT (JANUARY 19, 2014): I'm no longer replying to the people commenting on this review. People still don't seem to understand my warning stating "if you loved this series, don't read this." If you're going ignore THAT then I'm simply going to ignore your comment. It will not be read by me.*** Also, you may want to read through the comments before commenting. Chances are, what you're about to write may have already been stated. _________________________________________________
Well, to be honest, this isn't a real review, this is a huge rant -- the longest I've ever written in my entire life, and the last.I really want to do this to myself after reading up to page 314:I know how this is going to end so I'm giving this 1 star (though I wish a '0 star' was an option).
Let me get this straight: You were being a total asshole to Clary when you guys never knew you were related -- despite the fact that you 'love' her, but oh no, Valentine says, 'HEY KIDS, I'M YOUR FATHER!' You're like, 'Clary, I want you and, gotdamnit I'm going to have you.
1.) City of Bones ★★★2.) City of Ashes ★★Friends, I did it! I read the whole trilogy! Over a decade late, but aren’t you proud? And more importantly, I can finally move on to TID with Clockwork Angel! And I am so hyped, because I know this is the start of the series that you all really love! And I hope I do, too! And I got really excited seeing some names that I’ve vaguely seen you all scream about!   “Each tomb looked like a little house; some even had metal or wire gates, and the names of Shad
And even though I knew (and hoped and prayed) that you all wouldn’t lead me astray and that the “twist” wouldn’t be true, it still took a lot of enjoyment out of this book for me, because for the most part, Jace and Clary thought it was real.
And Isabelle is my favorite character of any of these books so far, so I just am going to put her happiness first always and forever.
I don’t know, maybe I’m getting soft, but I liked him as the villain of this book.
I had heard varied opinions on the ending, how some people felt the pay off didn't hold a candle to the amount of detailing and set up required to get there, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, probably because I was expecting (view spoiler)[a long, drawn out battle (hide spoiler)] but instead we get (view spoiler)[a satisfying dressing down of Valentine.
(hide spoiler)]Picking these books up a decade after they were originally published means I wasn't able to avoid all spoilers completely, but I gotta say I was still shocked by a few of the twists and amazed that I didn't see them coming.
These books aren't for everyone, and I respect that, but I also see why they have such a large fan base.
5 If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right Stars * Major Spoilers ahead* “I told you he’d freak out,” she said. “Didn’t I?” “Ah, the ‘I told you so,’” Jace said. “Always a classy move.”-Izzy and Jace OMG this book was so awesome. So many things happened in this book. It was like an explosion of events. Jace and Clary my God they suffer so much. I felt so bad for their struggles. Loving each other, thinking they're brother and sister and their love is wrong. But the part where they sleep lay
“Didn’t I?” “Ah, the ‘I told you so,’” Jace said.
Jace and Clary my God they suffer so much.
I'm glad we readers finally got to see who Clary's real brother was.
The way he came onto Clary and kissed her knowing he was really her brother sick!
Walking around thinking you're in love with your brother then finding out that your real brother did kiss you eww.
“Possibly,” Jace said, “but you have to admit that the majority of things are.”-Clary and Jace
Twice this book had me flipping out over Jace.
I love how Simon has really grown since the first book.
This is a re-read from a long time ago with this beautiful new edition of the book!
. Clary did get on my nerves a wee bit, I wonder if she did the first time I read it.
Okay, so I read the first three books in this series then I stopped.
But, some of the revelations in this book pertain to The Clockwork Angels trilogy.
Overall, I obviously loved it as much as the first time around.
I mean you CAN still love a book and want to drop kick someone off a roof.
I love all of the characters regardless of their stupidity at times.
Reread: January, 20161st Read : July, 2014This installment could be the best ending if Cassandra Clare didn't do the City of Fallen Angels.
Extraordinary plotline and pacing, engaging characters that continue to get better as the series go by, and the vividly captivating description of Idris.
There were also more revelations here and new characters being introduced, and let me tell you that Clary also became a better heroine.
If there's a certain thing that makes this installment even more beautiful, it's also the romance.
That ending!
*sigh Cassandra Clare sure knows how to draw me to her beautiful world!
Its tricky for the author to wrap things up in a way that is true to the characters, consistent with the themes of the previous books, ties up the major and minor story arcs, and is still enjoyable to read.
They feel as if--rather than the writer giving the series the ending she wanted it to have, regardless of whether or not it fit the themes of the other books--the author allowed these characters to tell their stories through her.
So I actually enjoyed this book and feel like I should have a ton to say, but first I'm taking a star off for the creepy little Lannister children and returning to that fun rant.I know I already went on about this in my review of the previous book, but let me reiterate: EVEN IF CLARY AND JACE TURN OUT TO NOT BE SIBLINGS, THEY STILL THINK THEY ARE IN THIS BOOK.
Like this is some super romantic moment for Clary when Jace tells her:
I'm done this series, and anything else Clare writes.Before I chase people off with my dour attitude, it's time for the Character Breakdown!Clary: I get that she's a 16 year old girl, but after thousands of words, she's still clueless, rash, and bitchy.
Don't talk to your mother like that."The one thing that really bugged me is when Clary reveals her special rune making skills to the Shadow-hunters and Down-worlders.
(Yes, I grammatically corrected those.) Clare specifies that Clary gets her Super Scribbles from the angels because daddy experimented on her by accident.
Seriously one of the best books in the series, there's no doubt.
I'm going to review this properly.
Wow. I am absolutely  speechless.  City of Glass was indescribably epic. This was, hands down, my favorite book in the series so far. Cassandra Clare has truly outdone herself.City of Glass was just so  action-packed  from beginning to end that I was literally grasping anything I could put my hands on to keep me from jumping out of my seat from excitement. THIS  is the series that everyone has been raving about. THIS  is the Cassandra Clare that everyone loves.With that being said, I've official
I'm curious as to what else Cassandra Clare has in store for us with the rest of series.THINGS I WANT TO SEE IN PART TWO:(view spoiler)[- A badass Shadowhunter fighting Clary- Clary not being a brat- More of badass vampire fighting Simon- Simon's family finding out about his vampire secret- The sarcastic, smart ass Jace that I missed.
“There is no pretending," Jace said with absolute clarity. "I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there is life after that, I'll love you then.”  City of Glass should be the end of this series. I can't believe how I enjoyed this book beyond my expectation. Clary and Jace finally end up and figure their problems out while Alec and Magnus are much more than just flirtatious, they made my heart flutter all the time. Valentine is likewise out of the shadow and does many things to poss
"I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there is life after that, I'll love you then.”
Clary and Jace finally end up and figure their problems out while Alec and Magnus are much more than just flirtatious, they made my heart flutter all the time.
So this book suprised me to no end with its attractiveness of the characters and great potential of the story.
And the ending was beating my brain endlessly when something happened to those characters I loved.
Maybe they're born with tendencies either way, but its the way you live your life that matters.”
I got everything I wanted.
His torment over Clary is glaringly obvious from the first chapter.I noticed that another review stated that she wished Clary and Jace hadn't have been as close as they were until they knew the truth about not being related, but I have to disagree.
She brings everything full circle for a completely satisfying ending - even though fans would be more than happy to read about these beloved characters forever, I know I will miss them.
I just can't be doing with her.I wanted more of the battle, but at the same time, the snippets we did see were very enjoyable and I liked the coming together of the shadowhunters and downworlders, I mean who can deny that?!This time around we got so much backstory, and it was worth the wait, I loved the way in which it was told, we got Angels, deceit, parents?!, uprisings, The Mortal Instruments, Magnus playing a character so much more!THE LOVE BETWEEN MALEC.
#1 City of Bones ★★★★☆#2 City of Ashes ★★★☆☆#3 City of Glass ★★★★☆#4 City of Fallen Angels ★★★★★#5 City of Lost Souls ★★★★★#6 City of Heavenly Fire A lot of people told me that the series picked up with book three, and I have to say that those people were absolutely right—this was an easy 4.5-star read and I almost rounded up to 5, even.
The writing is flawed (though, like I said, quickly improving as I continue reading), and the characters make some pretty idiotic choices every now and again (more like all the time, but it’s part of the charm, I swear), but this series has just been such a fun ride for me.
Μικρό spoil4,5 και όχι 5 εξαιτίας του Τζέις!Τι χλιαρή συμπεριφορά ήταν αυτή στο τέλος; Στην αρχή έδειξε τόσο πάθος με την Κλέρι, όπως και στο προηγούμενο βιβλίο, και στο τέλος, εκεί που λες ότι τώρα θα ενθουσιαστεί, τώρα θα την πιάσει, θα την αγκαλιάσει, θα τη φιλήσει, δε θα θέλει να την αφήσει και δεν ξέρω τι άλλο, αντέδρασε εντελώς αδιάφορα.
Λες και το έκανε επίτηδες η Κασσάνδρα για να μας κρατήσει σε αγωνία.
Και όταν τελικά είδαμε ότι τη θέλει, έπεσε ένα φιλάκι , μια αγκαλίτσα και ο ενθουσιασμός μου πήγε περίπατο….
Πού ήταν το τρελό πάθος του για την Κλέρι;
WOW. Don't mind me guys just feeling all da feels rn
(I am so sorry I am a failure with creative names lol) Once again, I barely remembered any of the story (things I remembered actually came from the TV show but then it just confused me because of how different the show and the books are 😂) so it was really nice getting to read this as if I were reading for the first time!City of Glass is definitely my fave The Mortal Instruments so far.
A large part of that is because the Jace/Clary/Simon love triangle is finally over and there is more focus on the actual story.
(can i mention that the clues were really emphasized so it was like the book pretty much was telling me everything and i had to read like, 100 pages before the characters found out about it.
and the book said that when cecile was pregnant with jace, she was talking about how nice valentine was and how he was bringing her stuff to help her baby.
so jace should also have demon blood but at the end of the story jocelyn was telling clary (i know none of this makes sense, i'm sorry) she said that jace only has angel blood in him.
hi i've obviously read this book a million times i'm just adding it to my "read" for this year
Definitely the best one so far. Let's be real, I can't take another book of (view spoiler)[ this brother/sister drama. (hide spoiler)]
The previous books where good, but not spectacular and gripping like this one.
The characters have grown so much, the amount of action in this book is insane, the plot was out of this world!
Start of the book (5,0 stars) 
The start of this book was so good.
The new characters that where introduced where interesting and I was so happy I decided to listen to this book right after City of Ashes.
AHHHH I want more from the shadowhunter world (lucky for me there are like 10 more books).
It is super hard to write a book with romance everybody loves.
Una tercera parte MUCHO MEJOR que todas las novelas anteriores. Me ha gustado mucho Ciudad de cristal porque hay una evolución de los personajes muy marcada y porque me ha atrapado como no lo han hecho el resto de novelas que ya he leído de la saga.Me ha encantado el ritmo, los giros y el final que han tenido todos los personajes.¡YA ESTOY EN LA MITAD DE LA SAGA! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeei. Ahora voy a por Los orígenes 1!!
