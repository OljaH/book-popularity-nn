This is not going to include anything to do with the actual Cirque Du FreakYou have been warned. I know, I was pretty devastated too...It's not a bad book. Darren has settled into vampire life somewhat well but upon summons by the Vampire Council, both he and Mr. Crepsley have to trek to Vampire Mountain to plead their case. Throughout the book, we are given snitches and tidbits of what vampire society is like -  harsh, cruel and noble.  The author has no qualms about depicting gruesome details.

Characters die, often painfully and without a 'reason.' I keep expecting (as seen with other middle school books) for the character's death to  further plot or provide character development.
Here, the characters die because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
ALSO there's no Cirque du Freak.
I picked up this series cause I adored all the cirque characters but we don't see any of them.
Good read but frustrating ending… So great story, the plot is building, it’s really starting to get good and then, TO BE CONTINUED… Really? The book is only 212 pages long! I get that the author is writing these for a young audience but we can sit and read a book that’s longer than 200 pages. The Harry Potter series should have proven that. If you’re going to publish a book then make it a complete story for crying out loud. Right now I just feel cheated. If the rest of the series ends up being

This was pretty bad.
It is really hard to judge the books in this series because they are parts of a bigger story.
Even so, I felt that the first three entries were way better than Vampire Mountain was.
I understand the need for an overreaching arc, but as a stand-alone novel this book offers almost nothing.
It starts nowhere and leads nowhere, with a bunch of new characters being introduced and no climax.
Nothing really happens until the last few pages that set up the next novel.
The only good parts were the humor and the likable characters.
Not my favorite book in the series so far, which isn't to say that the writing is bad or anything - the series is consistently good. If the series was a TV show, this might be considered the "filler" episode. I still liked the story quite a bit, but I'm more excited for the next one!
One of the things I like best about the Cirque Du Freak series is that the protagonist, Darren Shan (yes, also the author's name...which I thought was a pretty hilarious thing to do, thought I bet his intention was to make it more 'real' for the young adult audience), never has an easy time.
In this installment, Darren and Mr. Crepsley (his vampire mentor) make the trek to Vampire Mountain (if I have any gripe against the CDF stories, it is that the names can be a bit corny).
But getting to the mountain is far from easy, and vampires pride themselves on being tough resilient creatures.
Vampire Mountain, Darren Shanعنوان: قصه های سرزمین اشباح : جلد چهار 4 : کوهستان شبح؛ نویسنده: دارن شان؛ مترجم: سوده کریمی؛ فرزانه کریمی؛ مشخصات نشر: تهران، کتابهای بنفشه-انتشارات قدیانی، 1382 در 192 صدارن و کرپسلی راه دشواری را برای رسیدن به کوهستان اشباح پشت سر می گذارند، کوهستان مقر همهء اشباح جهان است.
هر یک از ساکنان کوهستان، چند صد سال زندگی کرده و همیشه درگیر مبارزه ای مرگبار بوده اند.
آنها میخواهند شبح واره های خون آشامی را نابود کنند، که سرچشمهء همهء پلیدی ها و شرارت ها هستند.
اما در این ملاقات حیرت انگیز، دارن با واقعیت حدیدی روبرو می شود.
بهتر است داستان را رو نکنم.
Pěkně se to rozjíždí... ani jsem nedoufala, že mě to chytne až tak moc :) ...takže s další knížkou by měl teda přijít ten masakr, jo? Nevím, jestli se mám těšit nebo bát... :-/
2 stars seems a little generous for this, since the book had nothing to offer, so 1,5 it is.
It was basically an infodump about the "broader universe" just to set up the next book, with a little bit of "Darren's life in Cirque du Freak has gone stale so we have to move on" in the beginning.
Just when I was expecting some action, the -already short- book ended.Not to mention a terribly sexist remark at one point: "There aren't many vampire women because we can't have children" Obviously, when a woman can't have a child, she has no purpose in life, amiright??
Re-reading 7.5.17: Důvod, proč celou sérii miluju tak moc. Upíří hora, která představuje ty nejúžasnější postavy na světě (i mého knižního manžela). A samozřejmě Gaver ve svých žlutých trenkách s růžovými slony. To neomrzí nikdy. Je škoda, že už brzy přijde masakr :(( Není nad to si zopakovat jeden z nejlepších dílů série! Kurda ♥, Gavnerovy trenky, ošklivá nemluvňata, Vanez, Arra, senilní Seboun a další! A hrozba pána vampýrů.. Bojte se!
I still very much enjoy this series, I'm sad it took me so long to get to the next book but I'm glad I'm still into them and want to know what happens next
In this series Darren Shan assumes the role of a half vampire and travels with Mr Crepsley as he learns more about his new powers of a vampire and he adapts to the standards and needs of a new vampire life.
When they arrive, they have chats of old memories, of recent activities and such and they just socialize, in book 4, Vampire Mountain, of the Cirque Du Freak Series, they also travel a long harsh way just to meet about their fellow vampires and then socialize like normal and have duels.
As I listened to this book, it all came back to me :D I love how this is the book where he (view spoiler)[first visits Vampire Mountain, and when he meets Rudi, and he discovers Harkat Moulds :D (hide spoiler)] I also love learning about the (view spoiler)[heirarchy of Vampire Mountain.
(hide spoiler)] I'm so interested in how everyone just listens to (view spoiler)[Mr Tiny.
(hide spoiler)] Also reminded me of how much of a shitfest the movie was.
As soon as I started watching the movie, I cringed and grimaced.
Such bad publicity for Josh Hutcherson.
Don't know really what happened with this one.
It seems that perhaps the publisher might have pressured Mr. Shan to split a book in two, because this one is only half a book.
Still like the characters and where the story is going, but it was quite disappointing especially compared to how good the last one was which so far it has been the high point of the series.
But hey, these books are short and fun, and the violence and gore is delightfully shocking and disturbing for a middle-grade book.
I recommend this series.
There is a time jump between the end of the last book and this one, jumping us forward to the next set of important events in Darren’s vampire life.We’re once again introduced to a new set of characters, all of which you come to love. We’re also given more information about the vampire world, learning even more than we have been given in the last three books. It is here that we really start to see other vampires, coming to understand their lifestyles. Another great book in the series!
I AM LITERALLY SHAKING RIGHT NOW. THAT ENDING OH GOD WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DARREN UGH I HAVE A LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE BOOKS.This book is way darker than the other ones. We're introduced to a whole new aspect of the vampire world and how the vampire politics works. I absolutely loved the dark tone in this book and I can't wait to read the next 8 books asdjsdgfsdjgjdsfs!
I was pretty dissapointed how Evra and Darren weren't close anymore in this book but I'll get over that I guess...I really like the idea of the vampire mountain and the tests I can't wait to start the next book! (Arra is really bad ass I like her)
Another enjoyable read, a few loose ends unanswered for but hopefully they will have answers in the next few books. Not a fan of Kurda, He stinks of betrayal.
Tätä olisi pitänyt olla tarjolla suomeksi vuonna 1980. Hyvä, että edes nyt. Tykkään silleen kuin aikuislukija voi tykätä.
No es que sea malo. Es que simplemente parece el inicio del libro y falta toda la trama. Justo cuando va a iniciar se termina el libro y yo así de ya se termino??
This book was so repetitive and annoying.
I know it’s a middle grade book but c’mon it had the potential to be a great middle grade book.
This book could have easily of been joint on to the previous book or the next book in the series rather than being a separate book.
Not much was going on tbh it was just a whole lot of info-dumping and plus the story doesn’t include Evra or the other performers of the cirque du freak and that makes me sad because I loved the atmosphere at the cirque and it made me happy to know that although Darren was taken away from his family by Mr Crepsley, he found a new family at the cirque and began to make new friends, learning to accept his new unfortunate life.
FINALLY FINISHED 😊  I really wished this book was longer, the 200 pages didn't satisfied me, i was so into the story then boom to be continued 😑  I definitely rated it a 5 stars on goodreads thou
3.5
The start of the new arc caused story build up slumping.
It wasn't my favorite out of all the books of the series, but this book is just as important as the others due to the significant amount of details it provides that will be useful to know for the future tale.
Really enjoying this series! Don’t want to say too much in this review because this is the 4th book and I feel like anything would be a spoiler. Just know that this series is fantastic and I really recommend it!
Darren and Arra fenced, and when Darren beat Arra, he earned her respect.Climax: (4-6 sentences)When Mr. Crepsley presents Darren to the Vampire Princes, they don’t like that Mr. Crepsley blooded a child.
The Vampire Princes said that Darren has to show that he is worthy of being in the Vampire Ranks.Resolution: (4-6 sentences)In order for Darren to show he is worthy, he has to complete the Trails of Death.
In Vampire Mountain, Darren found two friends as well.
In Perks of Being a Wallflower, Charlie is lonely and sensitive, but in Vampire Mountain, Darren is tough, and confident.
Vampire Mountain By: Darren ShanISBN: 0316905747208 PagesPublisher: Little Brown Young Readers2004 Vampire Mountain Is the 4th book of the cirque du freak series. It is as great of a book as the others. But now Darren and Mr. Crepsly are traveling to take several trails for Darren Will Darren pass them and continue his life? Or does it all ends at the trails? Darren Shan continues his great work of description. His new characters are just unbelievably amazing. Darren just continues on with this
Darren Shan continues his great work of description.
Darren just continues on with this great plot and he makes it even greater than before each time.
Darren Shan just continues to describe everything better and better.
Darren’s new characters just made the book even more all the best.
You just want to learn more and more about these characters and continue reading.
You would imagine they are real people he just turned into book characters.
Each book he makes, everything gets so much better.
He continues to write his books better each time.
His plots in each book gets better and better.
This was another good book in the cirque du freak series that didn't let it down not one bit, it was about Darren and Mr Crepsley's Journey to Vampire mountain, where they would seek counsel with the vampire princes about Darren being blooded by Mr Crepsley.
Darren had to face an insane bear in the woods on the way to the mountain and luckily he wasn't killed.
When he finally got to the mountain he was intrigued as to the ways of the ancient vampires lived, worked and hunted and learnt a little more knowledge about the legends and myths surrounding the vampires.
I think Cirque Du Freak Vampire Mountain was a great book.
Mr. Crepsley and Darren decide to go to Vampire Mountain for the meeting of the counsel because it only happens every 8 years.
Along the way they meet a pack of wolves that Darren takes a liking to.
I would of liked more action in the beginning of the book.
The main character is a boy so a male audience could relate to his thoughts more than females could.
Boys also tend to like action and fantasy more that girls do.
I also think that the first half was a lot better than the second.In this book a lot of the adults really bugged me.
I feel like they thought that just because Darren Was a kid, that meant he wasn't strong or smart.
They think that they are better or don't think that a kid can prove them wrong.
It was like she didn't realize that it was just for fun and that Darren wasn't purposly trying to make her upset.
But. at least she kind of opened up and started being at least civil towards Darren.
