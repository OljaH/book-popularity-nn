He does briefly acknowledge the danger of such a power but dismisses it because he feels that individual nations and the threat of war pose a much greater danger than a supranational group that overseas the governments of the world.
This had to do less with the Jews and more to do with the fact that Einstein thought that the way to insure peace was to promote the idea of a global community and he saw individual nations as a deterrent to that process.Overall, this book was well-worth reading.
El libro no es más que un recopilatorio de frases y extractos de discursos de Einstein sin estructura aparente.
Pero permite ver sus diferentes facetas y anima a leer más sobre este hombre excepcional.
No me extraña que consiguiera convertirse en un icono del siglo XX a pesar de ser científico, con lo que eso aísla (cuando tendrían que ser nuestros héroes, no los conoce nadie).
Es capaz de explicar conceptos complicados con una sencillez y economía de palabras envidiable, y su sentido del humor y su humanidad, aparte de su intelecto, lo hacen excepcional.
Recomendable como primer acercamiento al hombre humilde y enorme que era.
I lived in solitude in the country and noticed how the monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind.Most people go on living their everyday life: half frightened, half indifferent, they behold the ghostly tragicomedy that is being performed on the international stage before the eyes and ears of the world.Schools ought to be intent on presenting history from the point of view of progress and the growth of human civilization, rather than using it as a means for fostering in the minds of the growing generation the ideals of outward power and military successes.The most important factor in giving shape to our human existence is the setting up and establishment of a goal; the goal being a community of free and happy human beings who by constant inward endeavor strive to liberate themselves from the inheritance of anti-social and destructive instincts.

Whilst I can appreciate some of the points Einstein aims to convey in this book, I can't help but feel I would enjoy reading the complex equations that led to the formulation of The Theory of Relativity a lot more than I enjoyed reading this collection of works. To look at the current state of world is to get an understanding of how fantastical some of the ideas he lobbied for are within the context of current geopolitical climate. Disappointed.
So none of this was actually about humanism and the essays have no introduction or context included. Breakdown is roughly 50% saying why we should have a single world government, 25% memoriums to dead scientists, 25% discussing how great it is the jewish people now have the country Israel.
Surprisingly poorly written and redundant. More political than the title would suggest. Made me wish he had stuck to Physics.
An interesting insight into one of the wisest minds of the last century. Einstein waxes philosophically on various topics of his time, Zionism, and his contemporaries.
Interesting reading.
Really wasn't as impressed with this as much as I thought I would be; a good portion of the first half of the slim book is pretty repetitious, the essays covering the same subject matter in different framings (Not merely Humanism, but specific ideas about Humanism: IE: A world state as a judicial court, with the intent to do away with the need for war.) I found the idea overly idealistic, at best; not because I am against peace (A friend of Anais Nin acted upon doing something very similar in pronouncing himself a "Citizen of the world"), but because, as Nin's counterpart discovered: Governments by and large are filled with people who are in love with their own sense of power.
He recommended a supranational military force that would keep the peace and once agreed upon the "guarantee against war of world-wide dimensions can be assured" But the problem with trying to suppress man's desire for power with a super organization is that the super organization is comprised of MEN WHO WILL WANT POWER!He wrote that "One-sided armament of a national basis only heightens the general uncertainty and confusion without being an effective protection." Sorry Einstein, but that is just plain wrong.
As one would expect when reading something by Einstein, this collection of essays was incredibly thought-provoking.
I imagine that being involved in physics the way he was, and living right at the beginning of the atomic weapon age, plays a large part in his philosophies; but in so doing, we also get a rare glimpse into thought history in understanding how these events played on one of the great intellectual minds of the 20th century.
Not every essay is earth shattering profound, but collectively they make one think, and provides a glimpse into the mind of a brilliant thinker.
Professor Einstein writes with clarity from an unassailable intelligence of heart, mind and soulful existence.
Einstein writes of resolve chiefly.
And the absolute necessity of intellectuals to maintain, and assert their influence, worth for the betterment of society as a whole.
To not seek approval, but to do the work and assert your place as what it is: vital and worthy part of society.He spans virtually every aspect of what he saw of a 1950 America, and arrives at its need to begin - in any way - the deeds of humanism: As a whole people, as part of a greater wholeness.
something very advanced for our humanity that it seems like a fantasy, but with the proper precautions and a set of guidelines that could control and provide world peace could work in the years to come.einstein also explains the jewish state and how their race have impacted society as a whole, and also, stating that germans are evil people and should be punished.
i would recommend this book to anyone that likes to stay engaged in political advancement for society and the incorporation of intellectuals in the council who would develop that world government, according to mr.
einstein.
A very easy read coming from such a deep mind. Einstein���s remorse for helping to unleash the weapons that can seal our fate on a global scale came through loud and clear. He makes a strong case for his undying belief that the only way to avoid our eminent doom is the establishment of a supranational government that ensures government is managed on a global scale. A very thought provoking collection of essays still as relevant today as the day Einstein produced them.
I didn't read all the essays that spanned at least a decade or more but got the general drift. The writing style is archaic (think German speaker writing in English in the 30s -40s) so it doesn't make for ease of reading and the message is repetitive and sometimes contradictory (Israel is a good thing, the Arabs should just get along).There's also a sweet naïveté to his demand for a world government ala the UN... In fact most of his essays are naive, innocent longings for a better world.
An exploration into the humanist side of one of our greatest physicists. As a collection, it works well. He explores a socialism, a singular world government and the hopes for a path to an end of military conquest, and the spirituality and tradition of Jewish ideals.
Interesante resumen de la personalidad de una de las mentes más brillantes de los tiempos modernos.
I'd never read anything by Einstein but I found his views and writings on Humanism to be very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interesting in Humanism or Einstein in general.
He was a genius but some ideologies I did not agree with. Even so, his ideas are interesting to read. It is good to keep an open mind.
An insight into a remarkable man's views.
Way over my head. This is a book I had to read for a short time and then sit back and think for a while. Encourages examination of personal worldviews.
Great,beware of racial opinions!!!
Very interesting read, insightful and with relevance still today although I don't agree with all his points, I would definitely like a world without war.
I loved this collection of essays, Of course we all know of this man's genius in physics and mathematics, but what a gentle and loving and ambitious heart.
interesting collection of politics, obituaries, and a bit of science. I found this to be both dated and timely.
Political and social views remind me of Gene Roddenberry's.
