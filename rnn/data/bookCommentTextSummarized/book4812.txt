This may be the most important book in the development of modern behavioral thinking in psychology of the last century. In it, Skinner, begins to lay out the work of behavioral psychology for the next 50 years. We are still examining its philosophical implications and as yet we have left unsolved the problems of mind, consciousness, free will, and the good life.
Masterfully written, but the vast majority of observations and data is outdated, and reading it before being familiar with Behaviorism can be quite misleading.
Very good primer on the study of behavior.
