Nevertheless, Muir's writing remains eminently readable and the passion with which he regards his beloved wild spaces shines through even the driest of scientific analysis of the various plant species.Muir was known to his contemporaries for his work as an activist, promoting the preservation of the wild areas of his beloved America and many of these articles were written with that goal in mind.
Reading through them it is no wonder he was able to achieve as much as he did, with the establishing of national parks and encouraging organisations like the Sierra Club.

Muir writes a poetic guide book to the West: California, Nevada, the Grand Canyon, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. He paints a picture of each region in stunning detail that gives you a picture of what these places looked like to him, exploring flora, fauna, geology, and history. His comments about he Mormons are just hilarious! Especially if you know them.
This book got me into Muir. I've read every book he has written since. This is a book of short stories or recounts of some of Muir's travels. You can see the places he visited through his eyes as they were back then. An enjoyable read.
Muir paints a vivid landscape with his descriptions. I am drawn to his wonderful musings such as, "Going to the mountains is going home."
