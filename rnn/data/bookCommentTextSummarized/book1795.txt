An absolute masterpiece, this text should be the standard precalculus text book as it explains functions, infinite series and eulers formula so well.
So to reiterate .If you want a perfect precalculus textbook for those in secondary school , this is the book for you.
If you want to know where Eulers formula comes from , this o the book for you .
If you want to know where euler/napiars constant comes from , this is the book , if you want to see first hand where the trig functions are represented in their modern form.
In book 1, Leonhard with ultimate clarity writes the conceptual maths that begin to touch on and then grasp at the infinite.
Although no exact place exists anywhere in the history of mathematics where Euler's Identity is written where it is set to zero, Analysis of the Infinite describes the Identity using for instance the square root of negative one representing the same thing, so there is no guessing here - Leonhard is the discoverer of the Identity.
That is to say, Euler does not set the Identity to zero in Analaysis of the Infinite, but it is expressed there.
my very first reading about real mathematics. so surprised in that summer! like said: He calculated without any apparent effort, just as men breathe, as eagles sustain themselves in the air. Another as Laplace: read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.
