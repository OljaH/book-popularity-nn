One of the best books in the Billabong series, Billabong's Daughter delves a lot more into the emotions of Jim, Norah and Wally than previous books, using Wally's experience in Queensland and his bonding with Norah as examples.I rate this 5 stars.
This is one of my favourites of the Billabong series, probably because I like Wally and this is a book where we get to see Wally as more than Jim's chum.
Very much of its time in its attitude to issues of gender, race, and WW1, but a fabulous Australian book for all that.
