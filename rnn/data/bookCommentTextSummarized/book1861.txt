There's nothing particularly special about Middleton's selections from Nietzsche's letters. What one wants is a complete set of all extant correspondence, including the relevant letters of his communicants, with annotations, index and source notes. I read this while taking Hans Siegfried's Nietzsche course at Loyola University Chicago.
I found the footnotes and also the index particularly useful, springing between the letters as an amateur detective. What was I looking for? In short reflection, I've seen sentiments to mirror, and other signs to watch out for.
At the start, I would wonder aloud what young Fritz was going to complain about that day - by the end, even as his mind unravels, he finds his footing and barks to his march.

Reading his letters is not an efficient way of learning the philosophy of Nietzsche. They are fine for learning about his personality, but bogging one self down in the personality of an author and trivia about his life - what is the point in that?We have some fine language in here, some interesting thoughts about the unification of Germany, some interesting details about life in the mid to late 1800s, but these letters are not essential reading.
