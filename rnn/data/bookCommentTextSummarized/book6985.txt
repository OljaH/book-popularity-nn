(Originally published in 1945)Classic Agatha Christie- Always a treat!
With a nip in the air and the days getting shorter, I always find myself in the mood for a good old fashioned golden age mystery to curl up with.
Now one year after her death, her husband, George, begins receiving anonymous notes suggesting his wife may have been murdered.
He is determined to discover if his wife was indeed murdered, and if so, by whom.
It was perfect for the mood I was in, plus it is a Christie novel that I had never read.
This book was originally published in 1945, but it has certainly aged well.
The actress does not arrive and George dies at the table – poisoned, like his wife, by cyanide in his champagne.
Colonel Race and Iris's suitor, Anthony Browne, realise that Ruth Lessing, George's trusted secretary, had fallen for Victor a year earlier.
When the group leaves the table to dance, Iris drops her bag; a young waiter, retrieving it, misplaces it at the seat adjacent hers.
Colonel Race, together with the police and Anthony Browne, unravel the truth in time to save Iris from Ruth.
Lately, I have been avidly reading the books written by Agatha Christie, and forward, take a comment, here on Goodreads.
A year later, his Husband George Barton, begins to suspect that it was not a suicide, but a murder.
George was planning a dinner party to commemorate the birthday of Rosemary's younger sister, Iris Marle, at the same place where a year ago her sister had died.
All in all, Agatha Christie, wrote more than 80 books, phew ...
She must have had a very productive life ..
3.5 “Six people were thinking of Rosemary Barton who had died nearly a year ago...”Ok, well, I think it got old about a couple of years ago, me saying I love Christie and you smiling and nodding and then –as politely as possible– proceeding to scroll down and just ignore me because the whole Goodreads must have got it by now.
But this is just the honest truth, folks: I love Agatha Christie.
It wasn't like that at all.)So, basically, Sparkling Cyanide bought my favour by presenting me with irresistible characters and then making me think I'm smarter than I actually am.
Well played, Christie.
Sparkling Cyanideby Agatha Christie.4/5 Stars.I have no words for this.
Agatha Christie has done it again!
Never a disappointment, she is truly The Queen of Mystery.
However this book is more for the old-schoolers, either way this book was amazing.What I always think while reading Agatha Christie's books is that literally everyone is a suspect you can never trust any of her characters that were involved in a crime scene.
This has started off very interestingly but halfway through it was a bit dull and then the last few chapters kept me at the edge of my seat, I was anxious to know what was about to happen and how.Overall, I really liked this, it was exciting, very suspenseful and raw.
In 1939, Agatha Christie published a short story featuring Hercule Poirot, entitled "Yellow Iris." A few years later, she expanded the story into this excellent novel, changing the detective to Colonel Race.
Having read the story before the novel, I immediately recognized the similarity of the setup (right down to the name Iris).
I also have to give Dame Agatha credit for introducing me to the verb "cyanosed" (i.e., killed via cyanide), which I now want to work into a conversation sometime.
This is one of the novels I will keep and re-read, as knowing the solution does not diminish its style and the bravado with which Dame Agatha carries it off.
If you've read any Agatha Christie books, you'll know that most of the time, everyone in the cast could be the murderer.
Well, this is even truer in this book.
Literally anyone would fit the bill, and I would have bought it wholeheartedly upon being offered the explanation.
However, the author does two interesting things.
The first half of the book gives voice to each of the main characters, allowing us to get their motivations and personalities.
Then, all these different points of view converge for the crime.
The other thing is how manipulative Christie is.
She totally fooled me on a point.
An unusual Agatha Christie mystery without the usual convolutions and red herrings. The murderer, and the reason for murder, is rather obvious - however, the real twist is elsewhere! And it is highly plausible... (to say anything more would be a spoiler).
¡Tía Agatha lo hace de nuevo!Acabé totalmente conectada con la lectura de este libro y como soy de aquellos lectores que se deja llevar por la narración me encantó el desenlace, en serio!! Además de los personajes muy bien descritos, cada uno en el papel que le correspondía; pude congeniar con Iris, entender su personalidad y seguir su "destino".
والله رائعة من روائع كريستي، تتحدث فيها عن المال والحب وماذا يفعلانه في قلوب البعضإذ بدأت القصة بوفاة روزماري - الفتاة الفاحشة الثراء - التي اعتبرت كانتحار، بعد ستة أشهر بدأت أختها اريس - التي ورثت ثروة أختها - تنبش الذكريات بعد أن عثرت على رسالة تفضح أختها، ثم عثر جورج زوج روزماري على رسالتين وهكذا بدأت التحقيقات مجددا ... إلى أن قرر جورج إقامة حفلة لاريس في نفس مكان العام الماضي سعيا منه للكشف عن القاتل، فقتل هو جورج نفسه ... أحداث شيقة لا اريد أن اعمل spoiler هنا هههههههه
عبقرية! 💙
Now this is the Agatha Christie I remembered of my youth!
Twists, uncertainty, mystery and the human character in all its faults laid out for the reader.
It was hard to determine how this all would play out but I had my ideas but nothing that made it become clear.
I was really surprised by certain twist and loved every page.
I must confess it will be hard for Christie to top "The Man in the Brown Suit" which was the first in the Colonel Race series and this being the last.
Brown Suit was perfection to me and Christie's humor brilliant.
This must be 96% the best whodunit I have read.Six people are suspected of poisoning wealthy heiress Rosemary – a murder that takes place in plain sight at London’s salubrious Luxembourg restaurant.
the other 4% – pages 230-238; the denouement.I believe Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that she sometimes calculated who was the least likely suspect, and made them the culprit.
I rather feel that something like that went on in the writing of Sparkling Cyanide.This is a pity, for it undoes all the good work that went before – a flaw compounded by a ‘solution’ that definitely errs on the implausible.
I suspected nearly every character at one point or another in this book, but not once have I been able to correctly guess the ending and the murderer of an Agatha Christie book.
The death was assumed to be suicide, but when the woman's husband receives two anonymous messages he begins to suspect it was murder.
I love reading Christie's ingenious plots; which you think might be somewhat similar but by the end of the books are totally and completely different.READ THIS BOOK.

Πολυ καλο!!!!!!!!!Πολυ καλη πλοκη που κλιμακωνεται σε ενταση οσο φτανεις στο τελος.Καλο το φιναλε.Θεωρω οτι ειναι απο τα καλυτερα της!!!!!!
This is considered the fourth book in the Colonel Race, Agatha Christie mysteries.
I already read "Cards on the Table" (5 stars) and "Death on the Nile (ditto 5 stars) so apparently my streak continues with Race and I gave "Sparkling Cyanide" 5 stars as well.
I would love to see what happened with some of the characters (too bad) just because there was enough there to definitely want to see some of them in other Christie works.
I did love the ending since of course when Christie spells out who did what and why it all makes sense.
4 StarsMaybe I enjoyed this story because it was a BBC Radio 4-full cast dramatized. Or maybe I enjoyed this story because it was very well written...
I just finished reading Remembered Death by Agatha Christie which was published in 1945 in England and in America, and once again the two Countries couldn't seem to agree on what to call the book, England went with Sparkling Cyanide and the US with Remembered Death, I think so anyway.
We start the book with Iris, Rosemary's sister who does not want to remember that night:Iris Marle was thinking about her sister, Rosemary.
This night Rosemary went to dinner with her husband George, her sister Iris, Anthony Browne, a friend of Rosemary's, Stephen Farraday, another friend of Rosemary's, she is good at having male "friends", Mr. Farraday's wife, and George's secretary, Ruth Lessing.
Everyone in the book is thinking of Rosemary.
اول رواية قرأتها لاجاثا كريستي , قرأتها مرتين وهي الافضل بالنسبة لي بين روايات كريستي الاخرى .
Though it had been initially ruled as a suicide, Rosemary's husband, George, becomes convinced that Rosemary had been murdered - which means the culprit was necessarily one of the six guests in attendance that night.Interestingly, the question of who could possibly have poisoned beautiful, well-liked, friendly Rosemary is quickly answered - it turns out that each of the guests in turn had their own motive.
It was refreshing that Christie's approach here was to rule out several potential culprits, rather than spending the majority of the novel searching for motive.As always with Christie, I found myself doubting my predictions at every twist and turn.
2.5 starsI fucking hate these old-ass italian translations, I swear. How the mystery was solved was unexpected, I will admit it, but the novel failed to keep me engaged in its entirety.
رائعة من روائع أجاثا كريستي المعتادة. وترتني القضية هذه المرة أكثر من اللازم ما قدرت أخمن نصف تخمين حتى عن هوية المجرم. عظيمة!
رائعة أخرى من روائع اجاثا
I love Agatha Christie.
I always return to her looking for consolation of some sort, and her books always work for me.This is a very clever story.
You recognise the best Christie novels if at the ending you wonder how you could have missed it.
The plot is simple, yet ingenious.
And somehow you don't see it coming because Agatha Christie cleverly puts up a smokescreen sending you in the wrong direction.
This novel is set almost a year after the death of Rosemary Barton.
Her death was thought a suïcide, but her husband receives letters telling him otherwise.
Todo el mundo sabe que Agatha Christie es la diosa de las novelas policíacas. Hasta hace unos meses yo no había leído nunca ninguno de sus libros y cuando lo hice solo pude reafirmar que, efectivamente, es la estrella del misterio. LA RESEÑA SIGUE AQUÍ: http://www.elbuscalibros.com/2016/03/...
Three and a half stars.
In fact, Christie pulls off something amazing: (view spoiler)[she makes me sympathize with a guy who cheated, understand perfectly why his wife doesn't divorce him, and actually want them to have a great future now that they've worked things out.
(hide spoiler)]And it's these people's desperate, frantic worries that their beautiful, delicate, moneyed house of cards will come crashing down - their own almost petty squabbles next to the horror of murder, and the inexplicable fear, and the fairly simple mystery underneath the raw human emotion of it all - that makes this book work.I don't like any of the people here.
4.5 estrellas Este libro de la tía Agatha es uno de esos que te atrapa y no te suelta.
Christie hace continuas alusiones a obras de Shakespeare, lo que ayuda a establecer ciertos paralelismos: Otelo para el esposo despechado, Romeo para el enamorado que olvida a Rosalina por Julieta, etc.
Porque eso es otra cosa que me ha encantado: Agatha me ha manipulado hasta la última hoja, haciéndome odiar a ciertos personajes para después caer en la complicidad y la comprensión.
Re-read 26.09.2017 From 2 to 4 stars.A person is murdered, although it's seemingly impossible, because it's done under the watchful eye of several people - my favorite kind of murder.The identity of the murderer isn't actually a huge surprise, nor is the basic idea of the execution of the murder (it's very simple if you think about it), but a couple of things surrounding the latter poisoning incident and the way it was done are.
The moral of the story is the classic "don't take anyone's word for it", and it's actually surprising that a certain statement wasn't verified immediately.
