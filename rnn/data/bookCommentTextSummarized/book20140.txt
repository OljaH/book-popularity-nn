When they read aloud, things in the book become so entranced by their voices that quite often characters will follow the sound into in the real world.
Dustfinger spent twenty years in the real world with only a burning desire to go home.Maggie has her mother back but all she can think of is that inky, wondrous world - of the adventures and mayhem, the beauties and the beasties, and the glory and the magic.
She has to find a way in, if only so she can look.Slowly, one-by-one, the characters find ways to disappear into the heart of the Inkworld - will they ever surface?

There were some things in this book that genuinely disturbed me, and I’m going to point them out..Before I do, though, I have to tell you, I loved the book over all.
(I regard this as more of a children's book because of the age of the main character, this is why it affects my rating)Secondly, Meggie is only 13 and the entire romance between her and Farid is really annoying.
If Funke wanted it to be a “romance,” she ought to have made Meggie at least 16 in this book.
3,5 SterneDer zweite Band hat mir viel viel besser gefallen als der erste! Wo ich den ersten noch recht langweilig fand war der hier um einiges spannender und actionreicher.Dennoch werde ich das Gefühl nicht los für diese Reihe einfach das Alter überschritten zu haben 🤷🏼♀Cornelia Funkes Schreibstil ist zwar wunderschön märchenhaft und passt daher auch super zur Geschichte, die sie dem Leser erzählt, allerdings hätte das Buch für mich dadurch auch so seine Längen.Die meisten (Charakter-)Entwicklu

Their relationship struck me as unbelievable, as well, which angered me to think of kids leaving this book with the idea that relationships work like Meggie's and Farid's.
Furthermore, I felt the writing dropped in quality; Funke did more telling than showing, and as a result I had a hard time staying present with the characters.I wonder if she planned to write a trilogy when she began "Inkheart"...
This book, it seems like there are too many threads and she's having a hard time keeping track of them all.
I'm hoping the last book will be better.Finally, I was disturbed by the trials Funke put her characters through.
Einfach nur wundervoll. Vor 13 Jahren hätte ich es sicher sogar noch mehr geliebt ❤
Your editor would tell you to figure out which characters are essential and kill off the rest.
The difficulty with the book is that it's written for younger kids, but it is too complicated, not all of the storylines are as riveting as the rest, and there are too many complicated emotions for young readers to comprehend or enjoy.
In other words, it's too Harry Potter-esque to be fabulous.On the other hand, this book is about 200% better than Inkheart.
It's just a shame that you have to read Inkheart to be able to really understand and enjoy Inkspell.
I like that the story got more complex with the second volume.
That said, this book felt really *long* to me.
And the story felt rather...
Like not a lot was happening, given how long I spent listening to it.
It was 18+ hours long, and while Brendan Fraser did a good job, his reading was a little dramatic for my taste.
Not only does it mean there's a lot more storylines, but if you know what everyone's thinking and doing *all* the time, it pulls a lot of the tension out of the story....
I absolutely loved it.
Inkheart and Inkspell have become some of my favorite books.
Dustfinger - the clear winner for my favorite character, I have to agree with Orpheus there.
He can hide his feelings at will, which is very admirable (just ask Farid).
He believes himself to be cowardly, but he will go to great heights for the ones he cares about, such as Farid and Roxane.
I loved the ending - it made me want more, made me want to keep on reading.
I'm glad that Inkspell kept up the same daring modern fantasy elements as the previous in the series, but also that it brought some new things into the story that were completely unexpected. It was sad about Dustfinger though, so I hope that the third in the series is able to resolve it in some way.
Soon the Magpie, mother of the late Capricorn, shows up at the bookish house, accompanied by Orpheus, who proceeds to read her and Mo into the book—Resa refuses to let go of her husband’s hand and is dragged back to the world where she spent years as a foreigner.In the Inkworld—a Renaissance faire fever dream of Boccaccio’s Italy and Chaucer’s England—Dustfinger reunites awkwardly with his wife, Roxane, who has believed him dead for years and reluctantly remarried in his absence (luckily for him, her second husband has also died).
The only difference is after reading the second book my immediate thought was, "That was stupid" I honestly can't remember the last time I felt so let down by a book.
However when you take that concept to ridiculous levels where whenever there is a problem they just write themselves some unimaginative way to get out of it, it gets old fast.I know personally I won't even bother reading the third installment, for me it's too late to save it now and I have much better things on my bookshelf.
Eine Welt die dem Mittelalter ähnelt, aber von vielen illustren Charakteren bevölkert ist: wie den Wolkentänzer, den schwarzen Prinzen mit seinem Bären, die alte "Nessel" oder den Brandfuchs.
Es fehlt aber auch nicht an magischen Wesen wie den Feuerelfen, wo Staubfinger sich den Honig für seine Gabe stiehlt, den Glasmännern, Borkenmännern, Nachtmahren oder den Weißen Frauen, die die Sterbenden in den Tod führen.Erzählt wird abwechselnd aus unserer und der Tintenwelt, aber der Fokus liegt immer mehr in dieser verzauberten Geschichte, die der Feder Fenoglios entsprungen ist.
I FINALLY READ THIS!!
It's been sat on my shelves, next to my beloved Inkheart for the last s e v e n years and I finally read it.
This is something I never thought I'd read, no matter how much I loved the first book, because I was worried I'd be out of step with it, or feel too old to enjoy it, but THIS BOOK is totally outside of genre and age rating.
It's the epitome of a good fairy tale story and I'm beyond stoked to have read it.
Now, I better make sure to read Inkdeath before I turn 30.

I love this series and my 5 star rating reflects that. This won't be to everyone's taste.Darker and grittier than the first in the series, it's hard to imagine that this is a middle grade book. Great story filled with pain and death and malice and sacrifice and love and hearts breaking and evil rulers and nasty mean bad guys (and women). This tale is filled with thorough world building and an abundance of distinct characters. I shed lots of tears with this book and there wasn't many feel good times; it's a great dark fairy tale.
A lot of action happens in this book and at one point I feel like I missed so much in one chapter when I got so distracted at work.
At one point, I stopped caring if I was confused because I assumed at one point everything would make sense to me.Eventually it did.Besides the confusion and the action, I loved Meggie in this book.
It did nothing for me except make this book feel a lot longer than it needed to be.The villains in this book were good and entertaining but other than that I was mostly bored while listening.
I'll probably end up listening to the next book because it's the last one.
بعد این قسمتی که گردانگشت مُرد به خاطر فرید، خیلی هندی بود.
بعد این که قراره زنده ـش کنن هم دیگه ته ِ هندی!
حتی شخصیت خوش ساختی مث گردانگشت؛ تنها شخصیتی که دوستش داشتم.
یا حتی باستا.
باستا هم به شدت خوش ساخته و قشنگ نشسته توی داستان.
بعد پرداخت های اضافی ِ داستان خیلی کِش دار بودن؛ جریان ِ بازگشت کوزیمو و بعدم مرگش و اداهای مارکله، به نظرم نباید نویسنده هر چی سوژه فرعی بلده بندازه تو داستان!
گرچه جریان مورتولا و بازگشتش خیلی خوووب تو داستان جا افتاده بود.
So it took me forever to escape the Inkworld.
I was so enveloped within this world along with these characters that I found it hard to escape.
I'm a huge fan of InkHeart and this was just a wonderful edition to the original story.
Cornelia Funke is a great writer and I loved this story almost as much as the first book.
If you love InkHeart and want to learn more about the Inkworld I highly suggest you delve deep into this amazing book.
Bei dem Ende muss ich ganz bald den letzten Band lesen! :(Aber es war ein grandioser Band! Eine fantastische Reise in die Tintenwelt. :)
Ostaviću neocenjeno...toliku sam čitalačku blokadu imao da je knjiga završena na silu,mučilo me svako slovo.Sama postavka drugog dela je dinamičnija,vise magična,vise likova medjusobno isprepletanih.Nekako sam očekivao više, ipak definitivno ću nastaviti i završiti ovu trilogiju
Inkspell Review Book Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
Wow...this book killed my soul at moments.
He was read into the book by Orpheus.
Farid followed Dustfinger like a puppy.
Meggie really wanted to know what was going on in the world of Inkheart.
She decides to read herself and Farid into the book.
After that Mo, Resa, Mortala, and Basta were read into the book.
The ending killed me...I just wanted to die...my heart broke completely.
I enjoyed every single moment I was reading it like the first one.
Favorite Quotes: “Stories never really end...even if the books like to pretend they do.
Dita di Polvere e Farid sono la vita, basta.
Ora dopo un finale così, non posso che leggere anche il terzo; non ho creduto neanche per un istante che (view spoiler)[ Dita di Polvere  (hide spoiler)] ci ha lasciato.Ed ecco le solite Frasi ad Effetto della Funke (su questo è bravissima!)"Le storie non finiscono mai Meggie [...] Anche se i libri ce lo fanno volentieri credere.
Le storie vanno sempre avanti e non finiscono con l'ultima pagina, così come non iniziano con la prima."«Non è strano come un libro diventi più spesso se viene letto e riletto di continuo?» [...] «Come se ogni volta, fra le pagine, rimanesse attaccato qualcosa: sensazioni, pensieri, rumori, odori...
un po' estraneo e un po' familiare.»«Sapete, credo che i libri conservino per sempre fra le pagine qualcosa di chi li ha posseduti.»
Sunt puțin liniștită, pentru că știu ce se întâmplă în al 3-lea volum, but I AM NOT OK WITH THIS.
5/5 stars (obviously)Bright hope arises from the dark And makes the mighty tremble Princes can't fail to see his mark Nor can they now dissemble With hair like moleskin, smooth and black And mask of bluejay feathers He vows wrongdoers to attack Strikes princes in all weathers He hunts their game, he robs their gold And him they would have slain But he's away, he will not stay They seek the Jay in vainThere's a reason I like big books (and I cannot lie).
And there's obviously a reason I love the Inkworld books so much.
Also, Fenoglio in this book crossed the line with his stupid ideas and arrogance.A wide cast of new characters was introduced in this book, since it is set in the Inkworld.
Real Rating: 4.5 starsSimply put: WOWThe whole Inkworld is such a great setting to read about.
And while the first was amazing as well, this one is even better.
I think the best from the series to be honest, although I read this quite a long time ago so Idk if that opinion is still valid.
A superb series and book, I loved the introduction to the beautiful yet deadly Inkworld.
My least favorite part about this was Mo. He was utterly annoying, I just don't really like Mo and definitely preferred him in number one.
But I love all the other characters: Meggie, Farid, Dustfinger and Rosa are all brilliant.
“Isn't it odd how much fatter a book gets when you've read it several times?" Mo had said..."As if something were left between the pages every time you read it. Feelings, thoughts, sounds, smells...and then, when you look at the book again many years later, you find yourself there, too, a slightly younger self, slightly different, as if the book had preserved you like a pressed flower...both strange and familiar.”
so yea..the same as inkheart!!!!!!!
2Lettura di gruppo E&LDevo dire che con questo libro la Funke si è riscattata.
Mi è piaciuto di più.
Più intrigante e meno noiosio del primo.
Solo che purtroppo è rimasto ancora superficiale.
Le storie, poco approfondite e senza quel phathos che ti fa affezionare e patteggiare per un personaggio o per l'altro.
Forse si salva Resa.
Però meglio del primo.
La trama è più articolata,e un finale shock.
Adesso non mi resta che leggere l'ultimo perchè non può finire così!
Lettura leggera, senza troppe pretese.
Forse è davvero per bambini, ma per quelli che non pretendono di più da una storia.
