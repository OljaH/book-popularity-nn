EVERYONE  HAS  TO READ IT!!!This book was brilliant!!Pure gold!I‚Äôm in love with Simon.
She has Clive (the best cat ever), great friends, a great rack, and no O.Adding insult to O-less, since her move, she has an oversexed neighbor with the loudest late-night wallbanging she‚Äôs ever heard.
(No, really, Simon, please enter.) When the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts her heard-but-never-seen neighbor.
God bless America.‚ÄùFlaily Pink Nightie Girl and Mr Wallbanger Snorey Pants will always have a special place in my heart <3 Guys, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!

Text messages between The Book and  Blacky :So, what do you think about me?
Well you weren't short at all :D Well yeah I'm pretty long...
Just about average I'd say Pfttt you are average missy!
Didn't you like all the humor?
Yeah it was good I guess, the scene with Dr. Ross was the best :D Ohhhh yes, makes me think of dirty things, that man.
I wish I had my O back :( Yes, I wish it too!
Your O brought more frustration to me than it did to you!
Whatcha sayin'?
You didn't like all the
Book, all you talked about was the lack of orgasms, flirtation, sexual frustration, sex...
Blacky, Simon, Caroline, The Cat, The Book and The Friends are on a road trip, traveling in the car together:
Simon keeps touching the inside of the car, I don't think he likes it.
No plot whatsoever.Too much sexual frustration.Humor was OK, but would be better if there was just a bit less of it, you know, sometimes too much of a good thing can make you sick :DI don't really mind the fact that they had to wait practically for the (view spoiler)[end of the book to do the deed.

I was an addict craving her dose.I was lost in a dull world full of mundane stuff for so long I almost became a mundane myself.After a month of abstinence from reading and severe book deprivation,after long days and bookless nights,the time came to return where I belong.And I had to celebrate!I wanted something light.I wanted saucy and funny and Wallbanger promised to deliver them all.And oh boy,it did!But it also delivered sweet,and fluffy,and dreamy and a new book boyfriend that reduced me into a puddle of goo.It's official people,I'm in love!Again!
And they are all the same.A Mary Sue heroine with a perfect job and perfect friends who looks perfect but for some reason is alone and sexually frustrated.
Then the hero.
Thus, not really a hero.Even so, I usually make it farther than I did in this book and not because this book is worse - by no means will anything scar me worse than the virginity scene in In Flight *shivers* - but because I've just had enough.
If I hadn't had enough I might have struggled through and given this 3 stars in the end.But that's another reason I'm doing this this way.
4 1/2 stars overall rating for this book?
Review posted at:  Swept Away By Romance 3 1/2 to 4 starsThere's no doubt Wallbanger is a fun, delightful, moderately sexy, feel-good read that bordered on the ANNOYING.
I enjoyed getting to know the two main characters, Simon and Caroline.
Their fun and witty banter and developing friendship was what I loved the most about this book.
But, I loved his involvement in the story.
At times I felt the cat actually eclipsed the two main leads.
If you're looking for a simple, fun, and engaging afternoon read, you'll probably enjoy this one.
ETA: downgraded to 3 stars. September 20, 2015. "Hello O! Nice to see you again. With his lips he brought me one." ¬† ¬†3.5 stars. I mean it. And I want half stars!Once upon a time there was a missing O. The pressure of an O long denied, waiting patiently‚Äîand sometimes impatiently‚Äîfor her release. Lucky you, because you found The Wallbanger.¬†Simon: How‚Äôs the pressure now?Caroline: Do you want me to hurt you? Shut it! *a look of dreamy bliss on her face*¬†Enter Baba‚Ä¶¬†Hey guys! I wanna have a little
Simon: How‚Äôs the pressure now?Caroline: Do you want me to hurt you?
Text between Simon and Caroline:So are you the type of girl who wears a big floppy hat on the beach?Pardon me?You know, those crazy giant beach hats?
(hide spoiler)] Oh my, Caroline, please come a little bit closer.
You were a hair's breadth away from finding your happy ending‚Ä¶so, so close to end your dry spell and then (view spoiler)[the dumb cat had to attack.
Or when (view spoiler)[a stupid cat is in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Although I have (view spoiler)[to repeat that I wanted to hurt the cat big time.
Simon was such a mystery, and Caroline was a person I would love to hang with if she was a real person.
In the quest for friendship with Simon, Caroline got a bit whiney and started playing head games.
And I was like "WTF Caroline?!And then the story got really farcical, but I persisted.
She is turning into a desperate, stupid big fat cliche from every bad Chick Lit book I've read.Then she really, really started to make me not like her.
And the story about her friends got weirder and weirder.By the time I quit, Simon was the only thing about this book I still really liked.
*****5 Bring it on home, Wallbanger stars*****This was me 95% of the book... and more laughing....  ***************************************** This is the story of wallbanging photographer Simon and interior designer Caroline. Their apartments are across the hall from each other and the walls are very very thin....so you can hear everything that's going on in each other's apartments. Are you following me so far?

This is the story of wallbanging photographer Simon and interior designer Caroline.
Well, Simon doesn't do relationships, flowers, etc....and one night while BANGING(yes he was)....he hears BANGING and not the kind you're thinking of....(DOOR BANGING)....he then meets the lovely Caroline.
Yes this is a love story, but it's also a laughing-your-ass-off-rolling-on-the-floor funny, hilarious book!!
Because of that cat, CLIVE, Mr. Scene-Stealer!!I recommend this book to everyone....seriously if you haven't read it yet....READ IT, and if you've read it....READ IT AGAIN!!!*clapping hands*
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to spend every night listening to you try to crash you girl‚Äôs head through my wall with the force of your dick alone!‚Äù
Well, hello there, my new favourite. Come to mama!I judged this book by the title. And I feel like an absolute fool now, because fuck me, I loved this! Loved it!I can't wait to reread it and continue on with the series. And read other books by this author.
Just what I needed!During a pretty mad point in my year end, Alice Clayton put the smile on my face I so needed.
I loved Caroline, although she was a little crackers, but I've got to cut the girl some slack because if I'd have been lacking in the area in which she was oh so lacking, then I guess I would be a bit of a loose canon too.
The ending more than made up for my own frustrations.
God I love Clive...I want a Clive in my life.In all honesty, I wouldn't mind going through what Caroline went through if I was going to get a Simon as my reward.
freaking hilarious and hot read!
Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterestüíô I read this for the Unapologetic Romance Readers' New Years 2018 Reading Challenge, for the category of: Contemporary Romance. For more info on this challenge, click here. üíô¬†¬† WALLBANGER by Alice Clayton is aptly named, because when I finished this book, I wanted to throw it at the wall, it was so bad.I wanted to read this book because I love romance novels and people were saying that it was the funniest romance novel they had ever read.
I can see no other rational explanation for how something so consciously terrible gained so much steam (especially considering the lack of steam).Also, extra negative points for using the line: "I am not like most women" (66) and meaning it.Terrible sex scenes:The idea that a kiss, just a kiss, had turned me into this giant lusting bag of CarolineNeedThat was undeniable, and I knew that if he continued to make me feel this way I was going to invite him straight into my Tahoe.
I mean, why would some girls want to smell like a mango?
Why should a girl smell like a mango?

JUST PICK IT UP AND READ IT!
Let's get that straight right now.
Need a laugh and sweet read, you have your book!
Hilarious and sexy! One of my favourites.
It really starts to get good at the very end when they work out what made their first time lacking and we are left with a big fat HFN.
As far as safety is concerned: no rape/abuse, neither are virgins, there is a crinkle of a wrapper their first time but it's not mentioned again, there are no OM and no OW after they start the relationship and maybe even a little before they do.

I mean I guess there are boys that are handsome, nice and can cook.
But at least this book reminded me of my teenage crushes and I did have fun while reading it.
What I didn‚Äôt really like about the whole book and the characters was their perfection.

lol  (hide spoiler)]"You gonna bang my walls, Simon?"I laughed."You have no idea," he promised....There's an extra cast of girls, boys, and work colleagues, and they all gel perfectly into the story.
If you haven't read this wonderfully funny and romantic book already, you need to go get it and have some fun with swoony Simon Wallbanger.
This book cured me of my HUGE reading funk !!!!!  4 stars for the story and the humor + 1 extra star for the last two chapters ! Damn I loved that bit ..... a lot !  Goodreads just 'over capacity'ed me , so I'm gonna try posting my review another day !In the mean time , READ this book ! Its fuckin hilarious and awesome ! Edit : 30/11/2012  Now, Backbone and Brain were solidly in the wait-for-sex camp, believing this essential to the foundation of this burgeoning relationship. LC ( Lower Carolin
ummmm ...yeah that Simon is hot and the attraction between him and Caroline is almost instant .
So will love finally happen or will this just be a lets-just-have-sex-and-then-move-on thing ???
From a lost O to her baked goodies to her cat to her thoughts about Simon , sex and his 'harem' had me breaking into fits of laughter .
LOVED IT !This book is definitely hilarious with a lot of snort-giggle-smirk-grin- moments !
Not to forget Caroline's pussy er , I mean Cat - Clive were amazing !Wallbanger is a perfect mixture of romance , comedy and a whole lot of baked goodies !!!!
That they weren‚Äôt perfect little angels or bad ass bikers but real relatable souls struck a chord in me.Which brings me to the reason why I am writing to you:I have some things I wish to tell Simon personally and I think you are the only way to do that ‚Ä¶.
a huge Simon FanSo, thank you Ms. Clayton‚Ä¶ and I will continue to watch for any other reveals you may share with us in the future because I love the people you hang out with‚Ä¶.
As in:We're talking lost orgasms...Hot neighbors...Sexual tension that's off the charts...Laugh-Out-Loud until your husband looks at you like you've lost your mind...Characters that are so quirky, you feel like you might actually run into them if you're ever in San Francisco...Simon Parker (aka Wallbanger Wondercock)Caroline Reynolds (aka Pink Nightie Girl)Clive (aka Kitty Hugh Hefner)Even her girlfriends are hilarious!
How did I look while reading this book?Non-stop enjoyment and laughter.It was a heartwarming romance, and just what I needed to read!Let me get warm & fuzzy for a second...You know why I love GoodReads.com?
Really good, actually.It was hilarious and the story held my interest....at first.Heck, who wouldn't be addicted to you when you can squeeze orgasm out of a woman's vagina like I do with my juicing oranges every morning?But while this was a cute read and you seem to rock every woman who dips in your bed, I couldn't help to be a bit disappointed.
And this: the WHOLE BOOK all I read was Caroline's hibernating O, sex, sexual frustrations, flirtations, giggling.
After that long wait and the no-show, I couldn't appreciate anything anymore.Also, I can't help but poke at Caroline's inner monologue here.
I had a good time reading this with my friends at the abtastic ab-loving geishas, but I did find it a little juvenile and shallow. Funny - but juvenile and shallow.The best part of the book was Clive the Cat. Clyde falls in love with a girl who meows, attacks his owner's new boyfriend's head, and even flips off Caroline. "Shut it, Clive," I hissed. A paw came out through the crack and I swear he flipped me off... I can honestly say that this is the first cat I've ever liked. I've always known th

I've always known that cats are evil, but an evil cat like Clive?
I take back ever liking a cat!
Laugh-out-loud, snort-tea-through-your-nose, stupid-grin-on-your-face funny!I found that this took a little while to get going. At about the 25% mark, it was dragging and I was thinking to myself 'Ok, so? Come on, get to the point.' And then it did!And it was hilariously funny, brilliantly witty, yet adorably romantic and incredibly sexy! Yep, all of those things rolled into one book.  Wrapped around each other but now clad in a pink nightie and a pair of sweatpants. To be clear, I wore the pink
I loved every single character in this book.
Alice Clayton has such a way with writing characters you can't help but adore.
I want to meet a group of men like Simon, Ryan and Neil!
You will get strange looks if you read this in public because you will giggle-snort-splutter all the way through.The text chats were brilliantly thought out and so clever.
I especially loved the texts between Caroline and Simon...
That first image of him wrapped in a bed sheet, covered in sex-sweat, pretty much sets you up for the rest of the book.
read, Wallbanger is your book and Simon ‚ÄúWallbanger‚Äù Parker is your man!
I was expecting much more but well, I guess I am in a book funk at the moment.Simon and Caroline live in the same building.
*SHAKES HEAD*.The thing is Simon is not the bad boy you might think he is and Caroline is an okay heroine (don't have complains about her to be honest).I don't want to spoil the story for you so let's just say they keep seeing each other, they become friends, their feelings become more intense and...
If you want to laugh for a while and read a sweet story then go for it, most of my buddies loved it!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>
;) Liked her character, not the normal Bella types who whines, who's clingy, pissing off etc!The book wasn't HA HA funny but it was very humorous, had amazing punch lines and nasty double meaning rounds going ;)The characters were nice and something fresh..
enjoyed them ;D Towards the end it did get a little bit dragged, and the 'O' part was totally pulled and stretched!It was easy to fall in love with Simon, He was just that type of a guy!
What in the world was my neighbor packing to make that happen?....Sweet Lord, there were out-of-control pussies on both sides of this wall tonight.‚ÄúNow, you listen here, mister,‚Äù I said, trying for a more adult tone.
