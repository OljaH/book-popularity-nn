But they're destined to experience it."Ida Elisabeth nodded: "They won't have a good time, those who come after us.""No. And that brings up the question we were talking about a little while ago.
So I expect we'll have to take it gracefully if the family suicide rock comes into fashion again in some form or other.""Ugh, how you talk!" said Ida Elisabeth.Ciss Oxley said seriously:"But I've heard other people talk like that––young people who say, why couldn't our parents have bought a dog or a car or a camera when they thought they must have something that would make their life interesting?
¿Aceptarán que todos los viejos vivan hasta que se mueran por sí mismos e incluso que se haga todo lo posible por alargarles el final?»🍃🍃🍃Siguiendo con el reto de #WomenPNL de @todo.mi.ser, recorremos la obra de las catorce mujeres que ganaron el PN Literatura.
Ida Elisabeth, escrita en 1932 y ambientada en esa época, me ha sorprendido por todas las cuestiones, aún actuales que plantea: responsabilidad de los actos propios y ajenos, conciencia, moral; pero también la lucha de una mujer por ser independiente, aprovechar segundas oportunidades, luchar por sus sueños e inquietudes propias.
Ida immediately feels bad because all the inlaws who have always taken advantage of her (as depicted in living color with Undset’s own pen) encroach on her life again in terms of needs, and the true reason for Ida’s breaking off the engagement is that her fiance Tryggve is opposed to her letting her inlaws, including her dying ex husband back into her life again.
I do not see the beauty in a single mother who is struggling to provide for her own being taken advantage of by parasitic in-laws who latch onto her simply because she is good and giving and struggles to see people in need (given that their neediness is of their own making.).
I would not recommend this book. I thought the translation was poor as was the copy editing. It was a long read and at times it was interesting, but it really dragged in some spots.
From the author of the fabulous "Kristin Lavransdatter". A bit long winded in parts but makes a beautiful case for putting the emotional needs of your children ahead of your own romantic fulfillment. I totally related and found affirmation for my own choices in life.
A long, and not always terribly interesting, book. It took me a while to get through, but there are interesting themes and topics for discussion.
Slow going but true to life novel of the strong woman Ida Elizabeth who survives an unworthy husband and his family set as it is in 1930 rural Denmark it still portrays the sacrificial love of the heroine.
this is a good book and she is a good writer but she has one very important problem ..letting her religious views rule her storytelling as one expects from christian fiction and thats what makes her conclusions unsatisfactory and somehow preachy as in this one ...
this book was copyrighted in 19 and centers on the life of the norwegian woman, ida elisabeth.
ida marries early in life (as she is still a child herself) because she becomes pregnant.
her husband turns out to be quite unmotivated to provide for his family and ida must take up the slack - all of it.
she bundles up her child and secretly steals away to a new place.
at this time she is pregnant again, and her husband does not know.
ida has little time to ponder what happiness is - she is always working to provide.
It explores how changing ideas about marriage and family affect people's lives.
Ida Elisabeth is a young woman who makes the unwise choice to marry an amiable but irresponsible man (from a whole family of similarly amiable irresponsible people) who isn't anchored firmly enough in reality to reliably support his family.
This book is what one might call a "kitchen sink drama" about ordinary people, their decisions, and their dilemmas.
I like this genre, so I did enjoy reading it, especially as Ida's problems are ones that are even more common today.
Loyalty and the unfashionable virtues of reliability and fulfilling one's obligations are major themes in the book.
A previous reviewer mentioned that there was not a single likable character in this book.
It is true--each one is deeply flawed and intensely, well, human.
"Ida Elisabeth" IS a difficult (i.e. depressing) read.
Does youthful folly or the failings of one's partner release us from any of the responsibilities hoisted upon us by our children?
Is there such a thing as second chances?
The author does not shy away from the painful aspects of this struggle, but provides a brutally honest--yet powerfully hopeful--commentary on the choices each one of us must face.
a 400-page slog without a single character I could like. I'd have given this one star except that the writing itself is decent--though the translation leaves a lot to be desired.A young woman marries into a family of leeches, supports her loser husband, then finally leaves him when he cheats on her. I know the author tries to make a point about sanctity of marriage or whatever, but I thought she failed utterly, and instead made a terrific case for women's rights, divorce, and birth control.
A frustrating read for me. I'd like to see this story re-told in present day with attention to contemporary thoughts on disabilities (executive functioning, anyone?) and divorce/remarriage/blended families. Ugh, as Ida would say. I wish I had a better working knowledge of Norwegian geography and climate - those unfamiliar names and seasons were a bit of work to imagine.
I read this for a book club, and it will be a great one to discuss. Couldn't believe how relevant many of the themes are. If you liked Kristin Lavransdatter, you will enjoy this. If you didn't like Kristin Lavransdatter, give this one a chance. It is shorter and much more accessible, but it addresses some similar themes of marriage and family.
Though this novel was pretty depressing throughout, I ended up enjoying it. Mostly because it provided good reflection material for an online book club I belong to! Read if you would like to contemplate themes of motherhood, agnosticism, moral character, and duty. But it really is depressing, I'm warning you.
Hidaslukuinen mutta voi kuinka hieno tämä oli. Vanhanaikainen kieli viehätti, samoin Ida Elisabetin elämä vaikkei tätä naista kyllä helpolla päästetty. Lukeminen vaati tietyn mielentilan, mutta kun sen saavutti kirjaa luki oikein ilokseen.
While a little difficult to get into at first, I ended up liking this book. Ida Elisabeth is a virtuous woman who chooses the right path even when it is very difficult (as it almost always is for her).
Some powerful observations about the problems inherent in the modern understanding of the family, but ultimately a much narrower and more mawkish vision of the human (and especially female) soul than any of Undset's other works.
Normally I like Undset's writing, but this one was lacking to me. I kept asking myself, "where is this GOING?" It ends rather abruptly, and I suppose the character of Ida has "evolved", but it's a pallid evolution.
Not nearly as delicious as MOH and KL but it did hold my interest. Wondering why Ignatius reprinted this book.
What an important book about on mercy, marriage and how decisions have consequences. I recommend this nut with quite the enthusiasm of Kristin Lavransdatter , but a very close second.
Thoughts on motherhoodThe book was hard to get through initially, but it has a wonderful, thought provoking ending! I would recommend for any mom to read.
Very thoughtful story about a woman, the choices she makes, the consequences, and the outcome. It is an uplifting story with a lot of scenery description.

We read this for our book club. If you know any Fr. Emmerich Vogt you will recognize the "enabler" in this story. It was a good read some sensual references but nothing terribly graphic.
