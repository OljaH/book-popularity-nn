I am of the belief that I want to like Dreiser much more than I do as an author.
Of the other stories presented, "Nigger Jeff" and "The Second Choice" are the ones that come off as (mostly) mature pieces written by an accomplished author.
"Free" and "Married" serve as nice bookends to each other, but both are a bore to read (in my estimation).
Seriously, "Free" could have been whittled down to two and half pages and all of the points would have been made.
They just wouldn't have been made fifteen times a piece.
Using many "Top 100 Books" lists to compile a wish list of authors and titles to find, Dreiser became a name I saw on most lists, along with author, Sherwood Anderson.
When I came across this collection of 5 short stories in Seoul for 2,400 Won, around $2, with an introduction by Anderson himself, I knew the time had come to experience Dreiser.
With a style similar to Sherwood Anderson, I thoroughly enjoyed the collection, particularly 2 stories, "Ni**er Jeff" and "The Lost Phoebe".
I hope to find more of his titles the next time I am at What The Book, in Itaewon.
The central topic in these short stories is how we relate to eachother in life, death, grief, and love. Mostly, these are stories of people who, for whatever reason, have wound up tied together, and who ask themselves, "what if..." and "why" a believably human number of times.
LOVED IT!
i liked "lost Pheabe" the most. nice but unexpectable stories..
Very thin book, but some heavy writing. There's some rough psychological stuff here. I recommend it for fans of earlier American fiction.
