How could I have gone years without hearing about this book?Simply said, I enjoyed it to a ridiculous degree.
I like Kadrey's writing.
It doesn't feel like he's trying desperately to impress me.
It doesn't feel like he's trying to mimic the big powers in Urban Fantasy Butcher, Harris, Briggs, whoever the current flavor is.
Kadrey is playing his own game here, and there's a sort of "fuck you" attitude to the whole book that I really enjoyed.
Kadrey has a way of phrasing things that left me smiling and chuckling to myself in public.
I love Kadrey‚Äôs dark sense of humor, which reminds me very much of the Hell Boy series and Christopher Moore‚Äôs vampire books.
I suppose it might be argued that Sandman Slim is derivative, but the weaving of magical and the real has become a staple and what counts more is how the tale is told.
In Sandman Slim it is told very well.
Kadrey's turn came up on December 1, 2016 - The Binge-Watcher‚Äôs Companion Guide: Richard Kadrey‚Äôs The Everything Box [his latest book] and John Carpenter‚Äôs Apocalypse Trilogy
I mean, look at this delicious little piece of uproariously gruesome beauty here.
In my defense, I have to say that my rampaging, decapodic kids are forever and always getting mixed up in subaquatic skirmishes, so it's no wonder I end up missing out on some slightly scrumptious books sometimes.
His slightly violent tendencies really are a thing of beauty.

In fact, Stark‚Äôs name and the fact that one of the main bad guys is named Parker are pretty clear homage to noir fiction giant, Donald Westlake and his Parker novels (which he wrote under the name Stark).I liked the world-building and Stark's revenge quest has him bumping into all kinds of bump in the night baddies as well as Nazi skin heads with demonic weaponry, and a team from Homeland Security sporting soem serious angelic firepower.
By the end of the book I was sold on Stark's potential as a really good character.
My first encounter with dear Mr. Stark aka lovely Sandman Slim was when I read the great reviews of Sarah, the Murderous üíú I was deeply charmed and intrigued, well mostly because my latest date with Daniel Faust wasn‚Äôt very gripping for me and I was looking for another great character (with some similar abilities) in the lead to woot, drool and swoon for!
I like it in my fantasy reads so ‚ÄúSandman Slim‚Äù reading experience was like watching a great thriller on TV.I fell in love with this book for its smart, kick-ass humor, it serves well as a counterweight to the darker violent side and makes this a subtle, gripping and enjoyable read.
Determined to get revenge, Stark breaks out of hell with a magical key that allows him to access almost any point in any dimension.
His stay in hell has made him supernaturally tough with an extremely bad attitude, but he soon runs across various angels, demons, monsters, alchemists, magicians, Nazi skin-heads and porn shop owners that he has to deal with as he learns that there may be something much bigger than his revenge at stake.This had a great concept with a lot of original ideas and some terrific action.
It doesn't help that he uses the key about 5 seconds after dumping the body.However, the ending redeemed this book a lot.
Pulpy urban fantasy on steroids, it's perfect for an adrenalin read, but I recommend a pass if you are in the mood for deep thinking or don't feel up for violence.Jason-cough- I mean, Stark--has made it out of Hell and is looking for revenge.
He meets Kas' manager, Allegra; goes on a shopping trip for new leathers and boots; and stops at his old apartment where he finds Vidocq, an alchemist, a thief and an old friend.
Sure, the devil steals cable.A number of inexplicably odd tactical moves and inconsistencies left me wondering if Stark was supposed to be dumb, or the plotting was just that underdeveloped.
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?Review to come, all I can say is this book really hit me in the right mood.
How are you?I'm okay.
All I need is a cigarette, wine and a lobotomy and I'll be all good.Yep. Definitely caught me in the right mood - pessimistic, weary with just the right smattering of humour to keep me upright.
Buddy read with Karishma.
Thanks so much for introducing me to MacHalos and this fantastic book, Karishma <3.4.5 starsHis movements are quick and jerky like a broken wind up toy.
Not for the tender hearted nor the young, but for all of us who are fans of episodic serial pulp-noir, full of raw prose and very little which indicates the book and the author take themselves too seriously, this is right up our alley.
A young human magician is thrown by some "friends" into Hell and he returns back to LA 11 years later ready for some payback.
This is my first read and I am sure I will be tackling the complete rest of the series!
Let's find out who will rule the world - Heaven, Hell or the few adventurous and very corrupt humans and fallen angels...
I started 3 (4 if you count Tooth Fairy which I gave all of 2 stars) Urban Fantasies recently...one I took off my books completely as a waste of time and I didn't even bother to rate or review it...another I stopped reading and gave 1 star as another in a long line of anti-hero clones etc...now this one, and it's the same.
Or maybe I'm just too critical or particular...still, I love some Urban Fantasy books, some are pretty good, some just okay and others I find I wish I hadn't put my time into.
He is going to murder the dark magicians who killed him and the love of his life.
If only she had been as hard to kill as he was.Being back in LA takes some getting used to and Jimmy meets new friends and reunites with old ones.
There are some racist skinheads, a recovering vampire addict (Candy is awesome, but she had to give up drinking blood from the source because going vamp in this world means you pretty much go psycho and Candy would rather not lose herself in blood lust).
Vidocq is the bad-ass magician who takes her on as an apprentice and is one of Jimmy's old friends.
It's not just good ... it's [author=Charlie Huston] good.
he's an endearing sort - a man on a mission with a heart of gold.
well maybe not gold, but certainly high quality silver at least.the book is endearing as well.
Kadrey tries to come across all hard-boiled but the book reads as if the author was just as addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as I was.
I also quite liked that talking head named Kasabian; possibly because I also like the band Kasabian.
fans of Urban Fantasy probably have already read this; if not, they should be reading this series as soon as possible.
Men, you want hard-boiled urban fantasy? Here's a treat! Fans of Charlie Huston will get into this "just-escaped-from-hell" anti-hero.
This was a slobber knocker of a book! Entirely original to anything I've read. I thought I'd be getting something similar to the Dresden files but it's not at all (not that being similar to Dresden would be bad!). The battle inside Stark's head reminds me of Spawn. He's a really kick ass character with a vendetta and the armies of Heaven and Hell exist. The magic is really cool. Definitely picking up the next book soon.
Hell, I don‚Äôt even need a running mate.
I suppose I could leave it at that, and just walk away, probably leaving more than a few of you scratching your heads.
But I might as well expound upon my point, because once you start shoveling shit you might as well keep going.You see, James Stark is a character I‚Äôm not supposed to like.
If the cops can‚Äôt keep him at bay, then you leave LA (it‚Äôs filled with people more fucked up than Stark anyway), and head somewhere safer like Mexico or Colombia.Despite all of that, though, I actually liked the bastard.
This is noir urban fantasy, like Jim Butcher‚Äôs Harry Dresden series, but even grittier.
The main character, James Stark, aka Sandman Slim, is betrayed by a group of powerful magicians and dragged bodily into Hell, where he spends eleven years fighting in the gladiator pits of Lucifer.
Now he‚Äôs looking for the people who betrayed him, but to get revenge, he‚Äôll have to navigate a world of angels, demons, vampires, magicians, and plenty of ruthless mortals with lots of secrets to hide.
I liked it so much I immediately bought the sequel, Kill the Dead.
Not a YA fantasy.
Stark (don‚Äôt call him Jimmy) is back from Hell, and he‚Äôs got a one track mind.
While he‚Äôs getting his revenge, people keep getting in his way.
I‚Äôm not a big fan of first person present, and when I opened it up to find the writing style immediately kicking me in the face, I almost put it to one side for good.
But, I tried again, gave it a few pages, and bam, I was sucked right in.
A magic coin that swears like a sailor, the undead head of a video rentals dude, kick-ass Candy‚Äîso much urban fantasy goodness.
A kick-ass book.
It's DRESDEN FILES meets DEXTER meets DIRTY HARRY.
This is book one of a series that seems destined to follow the Sookie Steakhouse / Harry Dresden / Buffy Summers route of one Big Bad after another, all slightly escalating the stakes, as each subsequent tale builds to the ultimate big bad somewhere down the road.
If you are a fan of supernatural stories, two-fisted tales, anti-heroes and/or copious amounts of hard liquor, you'll probably enjoy this book.
Stark is out for revenge and wants to kill those responsible for his time ‚ÄúDowntown.‚ÄùTold from Stark‚Äôs point of view, the narrative voice combines a wicked sense of humor with irreverence, snark, and the need to get even with those who wronged him.
Stark is adept at all kinds of weapons use.
The world building is quite extensive and the use of L.A. and its‚Äô seedy side adds a dark, urban feel to this book.
One of my favorite characters was a Jade ‚Äì a kind of vampire with shark teeth.
Stark and his friends like their guns and know how to use them.
Our protagonist gets sent bodily to hell, somehow manages to survive for 11 years, then gets embedded with a magic key that lets him go anywhere, and comes back for revenge after they kill his girl.There are some interesting concepts - a bit of a twist that the guy coming back from Hell is still actually alive, some cool weaponry, like the na'at which is a weapon from Hell which is pretty mutatable, some magical stuff, so on and so forth.But the writing's pretty terrible.
Not enough, though, for me to check it out.I do think it had some interesting concepts and characters, though, especially if they're developed a bit more, but I think it could work much better as a movie or as a comic because the narration is really the worst part of the whole thing.
Ok. Sandman Slim has that same vibe...minus the emo goth-boy hero and scruffy little girl with a skateboard.James Stark is the pulp fiction style anti-hero of this story, who has literally been to Hell and back.
Sandman Slim, the monster who kills monsters.
And now that he's back, it's time for a little payback.
It's not a perfect book, and there were a few times I found myself thinking, why'd he do that, when he could have done this?, or WTF is up with all of his names.
Overall, though, this book was just a lot of fun.
I actually kinda liked that.
I've read more urban fantasy in the recent months than I have in years.
But sometimes, I just need an urban fantasy fix that doesn't involve any messy paranormal romances with werewolves, vampires, or faeries, you know what I mean?
Sandman Slim was the perfect break from that, with its gritty story about demons and fallen angels and a main character who, like in most urban fantasy books starring a male protagonist, is hilarious and always armed with a treasure trove of pop culture references and creative metaphors.
I am still picking up the next book though, no doubt about it.
Eleven years of fighting demons and darkness can do a number on a person and it reflects in Stark when he's able to drag his smoking ass up and claw his way back to the the world.This guy is a total asshole.
Angels and demons fighting for the control of humanity and the universe is always a good read because I feel each writer really does put their own individual spin on it, and I really enjoyed Kadrey's.
If you like crass descriptions and foul-mouth anecdotes, Sandman Slim is stuffed full of hilarity and offensive charm.Another reason I should have hated this book is the present tense storytelling, but once again, Richard pulled it off.
I normally put down a book as soon as I see the first "is" instead of "was," because I don't feel present tense is believable.
The only reason I even mention it is because I know some of you will care enough to stop reading, which, in my opinion, would be a grand mistake, indeed.I will definitely be checking out the rest of the Sandman Slim series.E.
3 stars, but could have been so much more.Okay, so this was a mash-up of urban fantasy, LA-style noir, gothic punk, with angelic/demonic tendencies, along with the potential to be a great story that didn't quite get there.As a 19-year old young man, James Stark was part of a gang heavily involved in magic -- real magic, the kind that can get you killed and sent to Hell.
Sent to hell for 11 years, where he was used by his demonic tormentors in a gladiator-like arena.
He has now escaped, and made his way back to LA for revenge against his former gang.That's the set up, and like I said, the potential is great.
4.5 magic-universe-slaying stars Holy macaroni! I can't believe I waited so many years to start this little gem. It was one hell of a bloody, grimy, twisty magic carpet ride. Sandman Slim oozes style with a boatload of substance to back it up, just like this dude....
Profane, violent, sarcastic, hilarious. Kick-ass anti-hero with a heart of, well, maybe not gold, but perhaps hell-fire burnished silver. This very likely the first book of a series.
I've been reading a lot of PNR lately which mostly consists of female main characters kicking ass, although I quite enjoy that I was pleased to read a book with a male main character as the narrator.
The book reminds me of The Dresden Files, but Stark is no Harry Dresden.
I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes UF and it's not put out by the lack of romance.
Dresden fans will enjoy for sure.
I still like Dresden better, but I don't think anyone can take Harry Dresden's number one spot in my heart, so that's not a fair fight.
His ‚Äúfriends‚Äù managed to get him pulled into Hell and he's spent the last 11 years entertaining Lucifer and Beelzebub in the gladiatorial arena, learning plenty of new skills (including how to speak High Hellion, which sounds a lot like barking), and acquiring a couple of useful magical objects.
I read an advanced review copy, so I hope the editor catches these things (and the typos) before the final version comes out.I really enjoyed Richard Kadrey's style, but I have to say that I didn't really enjoy the story of Sandman Slim.
I also have no doubt that I'd like to read other works by Richard Kadrey ‚Äî something without the personal vendetta and God-f'd-up themes.Richard Kadrey at Fantasy Literature.
