I remember I used to date a boy who, knowing my almost legendary loathing of Coelho, bought me this book as a joke. I honestly can't believe this was published. It doesn't even make sense!Each time he came over I would greet him with a quote from the book and we would meditate over it for a bit.- This was another installment of Men&Books in my life. I will write a proper memoir with this theme one day.
As you go along reading each page, you would realize that you can relate to what the author is sharing to us, that in each one of us there is a warrior of light, hiding beneath our folds of fear, doubts and loneliness.
We are a Warrior of Light, whether we believe in it at first or not, because we are servants of the longingness to find our dreams, to conquer our fears and live life with pure happiness and contentment.
I recommend this books, not only for those who wants to read somethings new, but most especially for who feels discouraged in life, for those who thinks that his life is meaningless and filled with loneliness.
هذه الكتاب نستطيع ان نقول عليه حكم واحداث اكثر من رواية، لان اذا قلنا انه رواية فإننا سوف نظلمه.مع جمال الحكم والاحداث التي موجودة في الكتاب هناك البداية والخاتمة الرائعة جدا من قبل الكاتب، أنا برأي انه ايظا ابداع وسرد جميل من قبل باولو كويولو ♥.بس أتمنى من كل من يقرأ هذه الرواية لا يحكم عليه من باب دينيه أو توجهاته أخذ منه ما يناسبك وتقبله بكل روح إنسانية متطلعة للأفكار الجميلة والمفقيدة.شوان مجيد 😉

"A Warrior of Light values a child's eyes because they are able to look at the world without bitterness.
"“So, a warrior of the light must be prepared to be patient at difficult times, and know that the Universe is conspiring in his favor, even if he does not understand how.”  Ah. It would have been so much easier for those in Auschwitz if they knew this.
Then they could have, like, totes chilled about the whole thing.
It is all marketing.The only good thing about him is he has given the wonderful Margaret Jull Costa some translating work.
Why this book is fascinatingly useful to me is, its a compilation of seeds that grow when watered by my personal experience and meditative thought.
Because we change and grow spiritually,mentally and in so many other ways, this book takes on and reveals many new insights and personal validations/confirmations as we change.
So this is not simply a novel, a story, a fable or a biography etc., it a compilation of thought prescriptions that when taken with a dosage of meditative silence expands the perception and perspective of the self and by extension the depth of our every experience.

if other readers choose "rich dad poor dad" or "the secret" as their book bible, i prefer to drift away with "the warrior of light"paulo coelho writes the philosophy of warrior of light for the ones who appreciate the miracle of being alive and to guide each soul to embark to their own destiny.quoted these from paulo's blog:The Warrior possesses the art of the blow and the art of pardon.

قال الشاب في خاتمة الكتاب:"لاحظت أن عدداً من الأمور التي أخبرتني إياها تناقض بعضها بعضاً". ولكن للأسف، ما قاله الشاب لم يستحق أي رد من المرأة الغامضة.هذا الكتاب ليس أول تجربة فاشلة لي مع باولو، لكن بدون منازع إنها، الأفشل.إنه متناقض، وينقصه القليل من الصواب، لا يمكن ربطه بالحياة الواقعية إلا إذا كنت طفل ذي مخيلة خصبة. لربما كتب ليكون كتاب مقدس لقراء باولو، يصف لهم كيف يكون الإنسان الصالح أو كما لقبه "محارب الضوء".أنصحه بشدة لأي إنسان يحب الكتب الفارغة الفاقدة للمعنى.
Rosso di sera, bel tempo si spera "Impara a guardare dentro il tuo cuore ed imparerai a conoscere te stesso."Niente, Coelho ha capito come fare i quattrini con il minimo sforzo.Frasi pseudofilosofiche e ovvietà random sono il fulcro di questo compendio per noi guerrieri della luce, sempre pronti a rialzarci, dopo ogni sconfitta, più forti di prima.
It was the right book at the right time.
And with being a psychotherapist I have often had very similar thoughts as Paulo Coelho when I work with people, helping them through their pain and suffering.
Thought I would include some quotes below from Paulo Coelho's book.
"Like the fighter, the Warrior of Light is aware of his or her immense strength, and will never fight with anyone who does not deserve the honor of combat".
"A Warrior of the Light might not understand the Almighty's intentions, but he allows his life to develop according to His creator's plans.
This was a book club choice and chosen mainly because we were looking for a book in Spanish that would be a fairly easy read. I thought the overarching story of the boy on the beach was worthless and the "advice" on being a warrior of the light was contradictory and simplistic. If vaguely spiritualistic babble really motivates you - this is your book.
“As I finish reading the prologue, it strikes me that we spend an incredible amount of time and effort fighting to achieve.
Perhaps it’s only after we’ve fought for long enough, lost a sufficient amount of blood in our self-imposed battles and come to terms with our permanent scars that we finally give in just enough to actually realize what’s around us.“The pandemonium of modern day madness has become too much for us to control, so we turn to ourselves – not inward, but simply in the general direction of ourselves – and begin to prune.
But it’s those longer branches and fallen leaves that grant us access to a broader perspective – one that includes passion, and joy, and courage to bet on faith.
This is the one book I want to read again and again and again. This is the one book I want to keep in my bag when I go out and beside my bed when I go to sleep. This is the one book I want to open at a random page to see how I should respond to a certain situation.This is a book full of pure kindness.This is MY book.
A Book Of Great Wisdom.
“behind the mask of ice that people wear, there beats a heart of fire.”    “The only trap I must beware not to fall into, is to think that each day is the same as the next.
In fact, each morning brings with it a hidden miracle, and we must pay attention to this miracle.”     “From the moment we are born, people tell us that the world is like this and like that, this way, that way.
It is natural that - for a certain period of time - we end up believing what we are told.

But, the system of thought is the same as drama queens that tries to make all the problems bigger than they actually are and then start to fight with imaginational enemies.No, Coelho.
But it did anyways.After tasting the popularity of these kind of "drama queenish, fighter assumptionish of self" books, he kept on writing at this level, not even a step further.I am truely so sad that this book was my favourite when I'm 13, I'm ashamed of myself.
More, I'm ashamed of Coelho for being a victim of popular desires.
The Alchemist was great, so naturally I went out and bought 2 more Coelho books. The Valkeries was not very good and gives a lot of insight into Paulo himself (not impressed). Then I started to read Warrior of Light and truly believe that Paulo totally misses the boat on what it means to be a Warrior of Light. Suprisingly for someone who writes metaphysical books, he can't see around his own ego long enough to put anything of value on the page. This did it for me, as far as I am concerned read the Alchemist and move on.
This book is a big metaphor and, I think, people see in it what they choose to see.
I like that quite a bit.I read this book some years ago for the first time and didn’t understand it entirely, I still don’t, but this time I also got annoyed.
There are some precious quotes that have been with me for years and mean a lot to me, but that is not as much connected to this book or author as it is with other people using them at the right moments.
And I think that cutting up this book and using all the bits out of context is the best thing to do with this book.
يؤمن محاب الضوء بأن الشخص عندما يريد الحصول على أمر فإن الكون بكامله سيتآمر لصالحه.ـ لا يمتلك محارب 
الكتاب اقرب إلى عبارات تحفيزية، حيث يقدم باولو تصورا لمحاربين يتميزون بأعلى درجات الإخلاص والمصداقية والتفاني والعطاء.انصح باقتناءه ولكنه كتاب لا يقرء مرة واحدة.
___كان كونفوشيوس يسافر مع تلاميذه و عندما سمع بأن صبي ذكي جدايعيش في قرية مجاورة.
ذهب كونفوشيوس للتحدث معه وسأله مازحا:- لماذا لا تساعدني على التخلص من أوجه عدم المساواة؟رد الصبي : و لماذا نتخلص من عدم المساواة؟ إذا تسطحت الجبال فالطيور لم يعد لديها مأوى.

والساموراي الذي لا يرعى سيفه كل يوم، فسوف يجد صدئ في سيفه عندما يحتاج إليه.
I feel that Coelho just wanted to add everything he could in order to attract more readers.
It is mostly a book for people who feel that they don't have any courage to deal with everyday's difficulties (everyone) and with this "warrior manual" he is trying to inspire people so that they can deal with it.
Since this is a moral manual (in an Aristotelian way, meaning that it suggests a certain way of living) I find it no inspiring at all, really simple, almost childish.If you want to read something morally inspiring read some of Buddha's writing.
Benlik bir kitap değildi ama yine insanın kendine bir başlangıç noktası olarak alabileceği bir kitap kitaptı. Öyle hop oturdum 100 sayfa okudumluk bir kitap değildi yani.Arada, yavaş yavaş okunabilecek bir kitaptı. Başucu kitabı misali. Bu bağlamda, kitabı sevdim.İçinde gerçekten güzel yazıların olduğu bölümlerde vardı (Onların hepsi işaretlendi.). Güzeldi ya. İlk okuduğumda çok kötü diye geçirmiştim içimden ama, okudukça biraz keyif almaya başladığımı itiraf etmem gerek. *-*
There are books that come to us at the right time, either we seek for them, or they come by chance, playing as saviors. I searched for this book and it was exactly what I wanted. Soothing my pain with the beautiful words, releasing my pressure with understanding expression, encouraging me with the simple rules. I found again the reasons for me to be a warrior of light, to choose this painful yet rewarding path. Keep moving forward, I whispered to myself.
قد يعتبر المثقف العربي هذا الكتاب خفيفاً وغير عميق وغير أكاديمي ولا يليق به أن يقرأه، ولكن هذا المثقف غبي ولذلك فهو لا يستطيع رؤية الجمال والحكمة الكامنة بل والحقيقة الواضحة في صفحات هذا الكتاب، قراءة ممتعة ولتذهب النخبوية إلى الجحيم :)
a quick read of what i'd like to call " a wisdom reminder "
Mon deuxième Coelho! :D Le livre regroupe un ensemble de bons rappels réunis sous forme d'un manuel avec de sages répliques. On s'ennuie un petit peu avec les répétitions, et pour ceux qui souhaitent un contenu plus complexe qui incite à la méditation profonde, je dois vous prévenir que vous serez légèrement insatisfait. Mais d'un autre côté, le texte est facile à lire, simple à saisir et à comprendre. Il est bon de le feuilleter de temps à autre.
سقوط مدوي لكويلو بعد (الخيميائي) الفكرة في تمهيد الكتاب رائعة وحماسية جدا أعتقد لو واصل على ذات النمط من السرد الشيق المشبع بالاحداث المتعاقبة والمغامرات الممتعة كان حال الرواية اكثر بكثير ! ولكن بهذه الطريقه الكتاب فارغ بكل معنى الكلمه من المحتوى .. فهو مجرد سرد لنصائح عن الصورة شبه المثالية للانسان او كما يسميه محارب الضوء . أسقطت كل نجومي وأبقيت واحدة لاجل التمهيد .
This book is a jewel for all of us who look for meaning in our daily lives as we struggle along the spiritual path.
Each of us capable of listening to the silence of the heart, of accepting failure without letting it get us down and of holding onto hope even in the face of weariness and depression.
Values like love for all things, discipline, friendship and learning to listen to our own hearts are the arms with which this warrior confronts the battles we face in the name of personal growth and in the defence of the light.
