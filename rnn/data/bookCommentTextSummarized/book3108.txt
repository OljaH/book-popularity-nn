If you're as obsessed with Chopin as I am, then you'll also find this collection of letters incredibly interesting, regardless of whether or not they're good.
I have read Chopin's bio and what a passionate man who made sacrifices and unfortunately died so young. I cannot wait to read this book.
Always loved playing his music and enjoyed learning about his life during my college days.
This collection of letters is great for the Chopin fan but I think it would have reached a wider audience if it had been intertwined with some biographical information as well.
Placing letters within the context of what was happening in his life would have made, I feel, for a more entertaining read.
Nevertheless, if you love Chopin as much as I do, this book will still provide hours of fun into the mind and life of one of the greatest composers.
Brilliant insight into Chopin's mind
This is a very useful collection of letters, charting Chopin's life from his adolescence in Poland to his protracted death in Paris.
These epistles to friends and family contain a wealth of interesting historical and biographical details, from Queen Victoria's fear of the Chartists to Victor Hugo's hypocrisy on the subject of marriage.
There is little on the technique of performance or composition, but Chopin's love of opera is evident, and some will enjoy his assessment of various (now rarely performed) works.
This book humanises a true genius of the piano - the only defect is that the editors did not insert more commentary in footnotes, as not all the letters are self-explanatory.
chopin, mon amour.
An epistolary nocturne. Etudes of the soul.
