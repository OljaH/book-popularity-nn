The premise sounds familiar, especialy for Albom: an elderly mentor invites a younger protege into a series of conversations about deep issues. But this isn't Tuesdays With Morrie, II. Instead, this is an honest exploration of how the faith of our childhood remains with us, even as it is invites reflection and change.
Albom is an amazing mix of sports reporter and author. This book shows some of his evolution as a writer. There are times you just have to stop mid-article and let a sentence sink in, read it a second time, commit it to memory. If you like good writing you can't go wrong with Mitch Albom. If you like well-written sports stories he is one of the best.
I read Mitch's columns in the Free Press and really wanted to read this book. Mitch's writing style is very appealing to me. Paper Losses was very entertaing and informative to me.
Fun to remember all of the good old days of sports here in Michigan!
