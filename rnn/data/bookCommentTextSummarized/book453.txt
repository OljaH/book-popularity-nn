While I love books about living comfortably in the outdoors--and as traditionally as possible--Kreps' book didn't seem very accessible to me. My favorite has to be Nessmuk's "Woodcraft and Camping", and it therefore is the benchmark upon which I judge all other similar books of its kind. While it did make me want to go to the basement and tinker with my camping gear, I can't say that I will rush out to purchase Kreps' book or even refer to it as a handy reference.
This book may be dated, but it contains a wealth of info on woodsmanship. I was particularly intrigued by the method of lighting a campfire in the rain. And I never knew about rabbit skin blankets...fascinating!!!
Good information.
Amazing look in to "old wisdom". The craft has almost been lost. Easy read and packed with information.
