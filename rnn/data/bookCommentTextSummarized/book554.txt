Classic murder mystery (written in 1919) that's a real page turner. Fast-paced, with great characters. Recommended. Ebook versions can be found free at Project Gutenberg here: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10373 .
Breton, when questioned, claims no knowledge of the man but he becomes interested in the case and he, Spargo, and Rathbury work--sometimes in tandem and sometimes along separate lines--towards the solution.I first read The Middle Temple Murder (1919) by J.
That's all you need to know." Other than the ending, this is a fine example of an early mystery story and, from what I read on the internet, one of Fletcher's better efforts.
And while the murder happened on one night, the real mystery and solution lies in the events of decades long past.I nearly put this book down a couple times.
And because it takes nearly all of the book to reach the same conclusion as Spargo, the reader isn't left flipping pages just to get to the end.
You say to yourself, "Good!" and then go one with your life.If you like murder mysteries (and you don't even have to worry about the time period of this as it holds up fairly well despite the fact it was written almost a century ago!), you could do a lot worse than this one.
First published in 1920, it's fun to see how different the detective work would have been done before computers and cell phones.I listened to this novel as a free audio download from LibriVox.org.
Some of the LibriVox books are entirely read by one author, and others, like this one, are read by different people each chapter, with some repeats.
Since all of the readers donate their work for free, it is surprising how enjoyable almost all of the reading is!
Some are very professional, while others are just like listening to your teacher, friend, or Mom reading to you; all very comforting.
A dead man is found on Middle Temple Lane and the one clue, a piece of paper with the address of a young lawyer on it, seems to have no connection to the death whatsoever... This young lawyer however, and Spargo a journalist longing for a big story and an adventure, decide to solve the mystery...
When Spargo, the reporter for the Watchman, happens upon a man who has just found a dead body, he stumbles into a shocking story of murder and intrigue in the heart of the wealthy (and presumed safe) Middle Temple neighborhood.
Instead, he and Spargo work the case in tandem, sharing vital clues as they uncover them.
Of course Spargo, our intrepid protagonist, gets out ahead of most everyone on the case.
- Also like many stories of the era, the connections between people grow fast and furious.
Alas, like many such stories, the novel withholds the key piece of information until the end.
I think in some respects you've got to take this for what it is; because by today's standards this murder mystery is very tame and twee.
Sometimes this felt just a little too contrived by how witnesses kept on coming forward, the police are quite happy for the journalist Spargo to come and see the post mortem, find out about all breaking evidence etc...
Spargo, the hero, was a bit of a arrogant irritation to be honest - I don't think that was the intention, but I didn't take to him!Mostly set in London, it's about an unidentified body found one morning in Middle Temple, and the growing mystery surrounding it as the clues gradually surface.
I only found it as a recommendation due to my taste profile, and the likelihood of ever seeing it at the library would be nil to none.
The newsman takes train trip from London out to a very small town where he checks out the hotel bar where he has checked in, and he sees a surprisingly modern looking barmaid alone, working on her needlework who "looked at Spargo when he entered as Andromeda may have looked at Perseus when he made arrival at her rock." Their initial comments to each other covered how quiet the town was.
What a great little classic audio read I found on books should be free web site.
For those that enjoy a cozy mystery with as little romance as possible, this was excellent in that slot.
Pure mystery, Pure cozy.
This book proves you do not need sex, immature cussing, and characters acting foolish to make a good read.
Oh my , I just recalled there was a drop of attraction between the protagonist and one of the two minor lead characters in the book and the book ended with them together, but was so slight it would make about 1/2 a page and the book was about 30 chapters.
I listened to the audiobook version of this at work. It was a really great story, full of twists and turns that I honestly didn't expect. It wasn't the usual murder mystery. It might not have been good enough to keep my attention if I had just been reading it, but as an audiobook to keep me entertained while working, it was a great find.
I think this is the best so fat that I have read of JS Fletchers mysteries. The usual formula from the Golden Age of Mystery books has been used to great effect with the reader kept on tenderhooks until the last few pages.
This was my first book by J.S. Fletcher, and I will definitely be reading more!
The main character is a journalist who happens to be on the scene when a body is discovered.
One thing I liked is that Mr. Spargo works with the police instead of attempting to completely lone wolf it.
I thought it was a fast, compelling read.
I also really enjoyed the clever way that the author featured the characters, so that each was a viable suspect until all the pieces fell into place, and you got the full picture of what had happened.
Fletcher lets me down again. This one is far better than the last I read by him (Dead Men's Money) in that at least the protagonist is not an utter moron, and for most of the read I was enjoying the story. But then it ends so abruptly...one piece of evidence, hardly conclusive, comes to light and suddenly a particular person is declared the murderer with no information about how that was proven or indeed how the crime was carried out. Was this guy able to make a living writing this stuff? 'Cause he could have used a few classes.
I read the Wikisource version.From the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, this novel reared itself from a literary grave into my mind via a specific reference on Wikipedia. It is not quite so much fun as Dr. Watson & Mr. Holmes, despite being from the same era and a more prolific writer. Nevertheless it is gripping, strictly profane & the ultimate reveal of the villain is deftly done, and perhaps even realistic.
Very enjoyable murder mystery set in London in the early part of the 20th century. Journalist Frank Sprago works with Scotland Yard to help solve a perplexing murder. I particularly liked the writing style. I would have liked a touch more character development, but still found it great fun.
Speedy delivery here to solve your mystery. It's easy in a world where everyone answers your questions and apparently no one ever lies. Oh, and there's a plucky newspaperman too.
A newspaper reporter uncovers the murderer of a rich man who has returned to England from Australia.
An old type mystery story. the book is available on project Gutenberg.
Available on Librivox but read by a variety of readers.

This is a fast paced romp around London and beyond.Spargo, an early investigative journalist, happens to be on the scene when the body of an elderly gentleman, stripped of all his belongings apart from one overlooked note in his pocket, is found in London's Middle Temple.
The note is the name and address of a young barrister, Breton.Spargo, with the aid of Breton and a very Press-friendly Police Inspector, sets out to identify the man and find the murderer.The plot thickens as a respectable MP is discovered to have accompanied the dead man to The Middle Temple on the night of the murder.
At one point, an elderly alcoholic working class woman is discovered who may hold information vital to the case.
J S Fletcher was a 19th century journalist and a very popular crime writer.
For a 21st century journalist, it's fascinating - the hero, Frank Spargo, is a sub-editor for The Watchman newspaper, but instead of sitting at a desk subbing reporters' copy, he wanders out to solve a murder, with the constant help of Detective-Sergeant Rathbury of the Yard, who never discovers anything without sharing the info with Frank.
"Ah, well, in my young days journalists used to pull out pencil and notebook at the first opportunity.
Quite enjoyable early whodunit in which a journalist, a policeman and a young barrister work together to try to solve a murder.Free download for my Kindle.
The body of a prosperous, elderly stranger is found in Middle Temple Lane.
Spargo, a young journalist, smells a mystery and sets out to discover the name of the victim, the reason for his presence in the Temple district at midnight, and the motive and identity of the murderer.
This is a gripping read, although, having finished it, I am still going over the steps in my mind, trying to work out whether all the parts of the puzzle really do fit together as well as seems.
Consider this story was written in 1918 and the detective/mystery genre was still in its infancy.
It had good character development, twists and turns that kept your mystery solving abilities off balance.
I gave this story a full 5 star rating in that it was well deserved.
Remember when this book was written and take it from there.
I was very forunate to obtain a bunch of Dover mysteries at a library book sale and am enjoying them all.
I constantly keep in mind the time period these books were written because of the part they played in the development of the detective/mystery genre.
I'd never heard of J.
S. Fletcher before, which seems odd considering Agatha Christie is so famous and Fletcher was a similarly prolific mystery writer.
The difference, based on this story at least, would appear to be that Fletcher's mystery takes place in London rather than Christie's small villages.This story relies a little too much on coincidences, but it still reads as an entertaining who dunnit.
A man is found murdered in a doorway late at night.
A newspaper man takes it upon himself to discover the culprit.
Step by step he follows the threads that lead back to events from over twenty years ago.
Having read read other mysteries by this author I would say this one has a very steady progression of following the lead investigator Spargo a reporter.
A man is found dead with nothing on him to identify him except a name and address of a young barrister and Spargo is one of the first to see the corpse after the murder.
He takes it in hand to find the murderer and does a good job of it too.The story quickly follows one lead after the other until past crimes and real names are finally revealed.
If you like old English mysteries this story and other by Fletcher are a good read.
...when in doubt - either publish an advertisement in the paper or, if that is not possible, give somebody an alcoholic drink and all will be well. Also, changing your name is wildly popular in this book and is a device used by many....ja esi nonācis strupceļā, tad labākais risinājums ir publicēt uzsaukumu avīzē, jo kāds noteikti atsauksies ar Tev vajadzīgo informāciju, vai, ja tas nav iespējams, ielej kādu grādīgāku dzērienu savu paziņu glāzēs un viņi paši visu izstāstīs. Turklāt, kādā dzīves brīdī vārdu nomainījis ir teju katrs trešais personāžs.
Not a great classic but a pretty good story and I found it very enjoyable. He keeps the story going right up the rather abrupt ending. This is another that is quite difficult to review without giving the game away. The hero is a newspaper reporter rather than a police detective and he diligently follows up every lead. The usual wealthy tycoon type with an unknown past and beautiful daughters, much beloved by the impoverished heroes, scenario. I really liked the inquest scenes. Recommended to Golden Age fans but not quite in the Sayers/Marsh/Crofts league.
