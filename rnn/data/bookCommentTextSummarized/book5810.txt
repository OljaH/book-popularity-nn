Exactly what you should expect from a 1948 book about the taming of the west (and its inhabitants). Great pictures.
Riding the Pony Express was a very happy story.
It shows how a little boy and his father be together and have a happy life.
Even though his father is a pony express rider they meet together and help each other out.
I recommend this to kids who like stories that have adventure and with kids who are brave.This book is an old book from the library.
So I think everyone, kids and adults, should check out old books in the children's department so the library can keep these books active.As the old saying goes DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.
Any book you can read by Clyde Robert Bulla will be time well spent. He is a children's writer who was writing before I was born. This book is about a boy whose father rode for the Pony Express, and once the boy had to fill in for him. Gives much good information about the Pony Express.
Short and sweet, the kids loved it.
Read aloud to Ben. Kind of a weird book -- the dad is weird -- but at least we learned a little about the Pony Express?
A great early chapter book about a fictional boy and the Pony Express. A wonderful way to learn facts about history through a story telling medium that engages the reader and helps them remember those facts long after the book has been put back on the shelf.
The boys loved it. I had no objections to it. :)

We really like this author. He has written a lot of short chapter books on all sorts of subjects that are great for reading together for a few nights and then being done.
