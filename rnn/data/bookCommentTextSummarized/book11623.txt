His writing is so clean and simplistic, I don't understand why more authors don't imitate his style.Actually, I should modify that by saying Dan Brown--da Vinci man himself--got his writing bug after reading a Sheldon book--The Doomsday Conspiracy, I believe.
He wrote about fifteen of them, becoming the sixth best selling writer of all time, before passing away a couple years ago.That above paragraph in itself should be enough to get you to read this work if you've never picked up a Sheldon book before.One interesting fact I read somewhere about him: he never sat down at a typewriter to write but instead dictated to his secretary.
This story is driven by Love, Lust, Hatred and Revenge between 4 characters: Noelle, an incredibly beautiful actress who chase to revenge the man she love and hate in every bit of her passion Larry Douglas.
A tycoon Demiris who get into this revenge and Catherine, a normal girl who is the pawn in this game of revenge...
till her life turns up side down.This Sheldon's book made me HATE anti-heroine/hero that I've never been before, ugh.
The book is told from Catherine and Noelle's POV and I hate Noelle *sorry, not sorry* Maybe because I love Cat, that's why I can't stand Noelle and Larry.
This is one of my favorite books and has been for a long time - I think I have read everything by Sidney Sheldon and loved all of them!!
So I inherited a lot of books from my mom and among them were about 10 Sidney Sheldon novels.
Written in the '70s, it takes place during and shortly after WWII.
But it's not "about" WWII but rather about three main characters who happen to interact during that time period.
Definitely a page-turner and suprisingly (at least to me) risque for the time it was written.
It is the only Sheldon novel I know that has a sequel, Memories of Midnight and I am looking forward to that one with relish.
Being somewhere in the middle of the most recent Man Booker Prize winner at the moment and finding it decidedly uncompelling, I needed an antidote stat.
I always expect derision when I tell people of my Sidney Sheldon love, but oddly, it never comes.
Sheldon is a marvelous writer.
'The Other Side of Midnight' is a jet-set sort of novel, making one think of the doomed 70s love affairs of Taylor and Burton, Jackie and Onassis.
There's one especially shattering, shocking chapter somewhere in middle that I shan't spoil, but needless to say, four decades on, it still packs a wallop.
I doff my hat to Mr Sheldon.
By Sidney Sheldon. Grade: ASidney Sheldon is one of the most prolific writers of all time. In the literary circles, he has been dubbed ‚Äúthe master of the unexpected‚Äù. From writing novels to screenplays to TV scripts, Sidney Sheldon has done it all. The Other Side of Midnight is the second novel of his career, the first being The Naked Face.The story follows a beautiful French actress whose craving for passion and vengeance takes her from the gutters of Paris to the bedroom of a powerful billiona
The Other Side of Midnight is the second novel of his career, the first being The Naked Face.The story follows a beautiful French actress whose craving for passion and vengeance takes her from the gutters of Paris to the bedroom of a powerful billionaire; a dynamic Greek tycoon who never forgets an insult, never forgives an injury; and a handsome war hero lured from his wife by another woman.
From Paris to Washington, Hollywood to the islands of Greece, The Other Side of Midnight is the story of four star-crossed lives enmeshed in a deadly ritual of passion, intrigue and corruption.The plot basically revolves around two women: Noelle Page and Catherine Alexander.Noelle Page, born in a small French town, is a young woman of unparalleled beauty.
Unputdownable ! Noelle is a wonderful lady who is betrayed by Larry Douglas at an exceptionally youthful age. In this way, she needs to deliver retribution on Larry. Catherine gets hitched to Larry. Noelle joins Constantin Demiris in Greece and brings Larry as Demiris' own pilot. Noelle and Larry presently genuinely cherish each other and Noelle does not dither about killing any individual who gets in her direction. Along these lines, Noelle and Larry choose to kill Catherine. I'm sorry I can't disclose here anymore üòã To know what happens next, you better start reading it yourself.
What a book! The story, the characters... And the ending! Totally unexpected :D
Read when I was really, really young. Thought it was great then. Not sure how I'd feel about it now...
Why couldn't Larry Douglas recognise Noelle Page when he later became her main pilot as it were?
Yes, he had had countless women over the years, but surely he would remember a woman depicted as incredibly beautiful with especial features...a woman he had lived with in an hotel for quite some time before he disappeared...a woman who just some years later became a global actress always in the media and the like.
A woman he had promised to marry...I do not wish to be tedious, but consider it, her startling beauty, her name, their staying together, her becoming a global star still using her real name...Also consider that it was only like after 6 years after they had met that she became world famous.
In O.S.M ,we are thrust into the center of a thrillingly constructed courtroom drama which rivets international attention, Marseille in France pitches in with the smell of fish and scheming townfolk, we become voyeurs in the life of a young woman whose fantastic beauty is matched by her mental strength, soar into the skies where WWII planes zoom in a dance of death, peer into the colossal mind of a business tycoon who will not admit defeat, breeze past the glamour and riches of the super-wealthy and into a charmingly presented tour of the cities and countryside of Greece that is beautifully woven into the storyline.
However, this time Sheldon has negated the story in the middle to the end, and it made a disappointing point of view.Essentially, The Other Side of Midnight occurs before, during, and after World War II, but this is not a war novel.
It started with a beautiful French woman, Noelle Page.
Mr Page advises his daughter that she has all the beauty a woman will ever need.
Noelle fell very in love with Lanchon.
And now Lanchon uses Noelle to fulfill his every desire.There's only one thing I love in this story; the characters.
This is the first book I read of this author.
It doesn't happen often when I'm in awe with an author's writing skill more than the story and characters he created in a book.
Because the characters have more layers of depth under the surface that you will not be able to write them off simply as good and bad.
The author kept me on edge the whole time and tricking me with the turn of events in the story.
I look forward to read more of his books.
This book is fantastic! It's the first one i read by Sidney Sheldon and I just loved the way he built the story of the main characters induvidually, until they crossed and became the same. The story is super catchy and the characters are fascinating.
I was expecting this to be a lot fluffier than it was, I guess it goes to show you shouldn‚Äôt always judge a book by its cover! That being said, I very much enjoyed the story nonetheless. I‚Äôm a fan of historical fiction and to have it mixed in with a thriller was quite interesting. There were a few unexpected twists that quite surprised me and made me enjoy the story even more. And the ending quite surprised me, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to take that turn!
As this is my second read of the book, I was really glad I feel the same way I felt the first time I read it.
Even much better.It has got to be the most suspenseful book where you do not see the twist until at the very end.
It has other elements but these three is the biggest ingredients of contribution in the book.I never read a character like Constantin.
You should read how he gained his wealth, totally manipulative and but brilliant for a scoundrel.
She is the sorriest character and I felt so angry when it comes to the ending.

It's a very addictive book with the combination of Dumas, Wilde and Archer. The book is basically about power and its consequences, which is just beautiful. The writing is all very dark and haunting, with elements of surprises. One would never know certain events would occur until it happened. It leaves the reader asking questions incessantly and of course, the perfect ending.
Unputdownable. I devoured this book. I found the characters fascinating, the time period fascinating and the end played perfectly into the whole idea of these people playing a big game of chess.
Then she met larry, at a studio where she was tasked to do as an assistant director.On that day, CAtherine called Bill and said, she just married Larry Douglas.Many turns happened until Noelle knew what happened to larry and that he was now a married man with a girl named Catherine Alexanders.The war has ended and Larry was sent back to his wife without a job.
Catherine knew that her husband was having an affair so she decided to stay tough and never give up for the love she built her life.Desperate to be together, Larry and Noelle make deadly plans.
It's the first Sidney Sheldon book I read, handed down to me by my mum.
He's a charmer that's for sure and at times he has his 'good guy' moments but seriously ladies, he's NOT worth it.
Noelle was an interesting character but I found reading her parts uncomfortable at times, because I couldn't imagine how someone could do some of the things she did.
I liked her a lot then and began to sympathize with her a little more, until she and Larry met up and began plotting their evil scheme.
After reading only one book Sheldon is the Man, to me anyway.
While I remembered few details, two scenes I knew by heart, each involving one of the two female protagonists.
One was a self-executed abortion with a clothes hanger.
Another was a self-aborted sex scene with a college jock.
That's what writers adept at scene-stealing can do - they leave their mark on your consciousness.I began to tire of Sheldon's cockily sure style after a while.
But see - here's where smug writers get smart.
I continued reading, because I wanted to corroborate my theories.
And when I did, I half wanted to throw the book across the room and half sighed contentedly.
Catherine, on the other hand, falls in love with an older man, Fraser, a stolid Washington bigwig, but she too later falls under the hypnotic spell of the devilishly passionate Douglas who, by the way, is an ace fighter pilot in WWII.
But remember this: Noelle is plotting revenge on Douglas, the cad.
At this point, the two stories move closer, ending in Greece, spiraling down a slippery slope of murder schemes, failed plots, romantic nights, successful plots, mountains in the clouds, rickety foot-bridges, bottomless volcanic lakes, terror in dark caves, hokey sex, stunning Mediterranean vistas...all that stuff.It is tale of glamorous vengeance, a riveting book tough to put down once you started.
This novel is quite enjoyable in the book 1 and book 2 of this series.
I have read one of Sidney Sheldon's book before this book, Rage of Angel.
I can't stop comparing similarities between those books: heroine- beautiful, intelligent women, sex& pleasure, and tragedy.
In this book, there are 2 leading female characters and both of them are very sexy, beautiful and really intelligent.
Somehow, the heroine are made way too much amazing that I can imagine them in real life.
Like the book Rage of Angel, my anticipation dropped flat right from the last one-third part of book.
Great book
Everything was working fine with this book until the main character lost her sight of end-goal.
In short, the main crusader of the story lost its charm in the mid-way but until there it is a spellbinding book.
Part 2 & 3 are more of reaching till the end just to know the crux.Characters overview:Noelle Page - Main protagonist of the story.
She is more like typical Indian women who can forgive any mistake of her husband and just try till the end to save her marriage.
Ends up Friend-zoned.Constantin Demiris - Rothschild of this book.
intriguingnot really my cup of tea, though;plus the defense's tactics were a bit annoyingp161: "i don‚Äôt know what "he's talking about," she said firmly.p230: he brought the ship down in a flawless three-point landing, and he and paul metaxas strolled back to the cabin.p301: she started to fall and held herself against the bednost until it passed.plus maybe a dozen more ocr errors, l to 1, y to v and so on
