A scientist's facial vulgarization caused by a lab explosion alienates and victimizes him, spurring him to create a lifelike mask capable of human expression.
In the guise of this foolproof mask, he hopes to interact with the world again without the humiliation of his scars and, more personally, to seduce his wife whom he believes has been avoiding him.Man's soul is in his skin...I have come to observe with the greatest care the appearance of soldiers who have been wounded.
Abe suggests that within the seemingly normal external self solemnly lurks the internal alien.
Asıl önemli olan, o dönem bu kadar parlayan bir yazarın bir sonraki eserinin ne olacağına dair olan meraktır.Sene 1964’ü gösterdiğinde “Kumların Kadını” filmiyle halen fırtına misali isminden bahsettiren Kobo Abe “Başkasının Yüzü” isimli romanını yayımladı.
Bu tarz anlatıların en büyük handikabı olan inandırıcılıktan uzaklaşma hatasına düşmemiştir Kobo Abe. Hatta karakterin maske yapımına harcadığı çaba o kadar ayrıntılı ve edebi olmaktan ziyade bilimsel bir dille aktarılmış ki inanmamak imkânsız hale getirilmiş.
Teshigahara ile Abe’nin ikinci işbirliği olan bu film de tıpkı “Kumların Kadını” ve daha sonra gelecek diğer iki film gibi, kitaptan sonra mutlaka izlenmeyi hak etmektedir.8.5/10
De hecho habla de la máscara en tercera persona, como su fuera otro personaje.En líneas generales el libro me gustó pero tan sólo eso y cuesta mucho encontrar frases contundentes, de esas que lo hacen pensar a uno.Tal vez su comparación con la criatura de Frankenstein sea la que más se asemeja a la sensación que atraviesa cuando algunos personajes pueden ver su rostro destruido.
Huge disappointment.I came across Kobo Abe by way of Hiroshi Teshigahara’s screen adaptation of ‘The Woman in the Dunes,’ as well as ‘Pitfall,’ both of which I regard as masterpieces of Japanese cinema, on par with the films of Kurosawa and the other Japanese greats.
Poignant insights or thought-provoking ideas are either few and far between, or else well disguised, locked within closed loops of quasi-philosophical non sequiturs—ostensibly the protagonist’s jotted-down musings on such themes as identity, alienation, and sexual desire—which make up the bulk of the novel.
Maybe there is profound insight and meaning to be had from some of those passages.
Face of Another is a kind of post-Kafka take on the experiment gone wrong stories of Wells and Stevenson.
Abe sometimes sinks his narrative drive by fully realizing the artifice through which he is revealing his story, here it is the notebooks of the scientist who creates the titular object, written to his wife.
This mirrors the structures of Secret Rendezvous and Box Man and in the final post-script of the wife echoes the finale of Tanizaki’s The Key. The notebooks contain anecdotal philosophizing and scientific procedures, alongside manic confessions and visceral accounts of his dissociative panic, and accounts of folk tales and movies that reflect the book’s themes.
This is by far my favorite of Abe’s novels.
It kept reminding me of a more universally centered American Psycho, 30 years before Ellis’s, with even more layering of psychological effect and more eerie calm as the narrator continues revealing himself, burying himself, and creating a new self over and over again, unto a whole.
This novel captures so well the sense of being a person imprisoned both in the self and in the thousands of other selves surrounding any given person.
Αρκετά διαφορετικό από τη Γυναίκα της Άμμου, με λιγότερο εντυπωσιακή γραφή. Τα θέματα όμως με τα οποία καταπιάνεται ο Άμπε ( η ταυτότητα με τους μύθους και τις διαστροφές της, η μοναξιά, η σχέση του ανθρώπου με τον Άλλο σε όλα τα επίπεδα, ο έρωτας, τα σεξουαλικά ταμπού, η ψυχοσύνθεση του σύγχρονου ανθρώπου στο αστικό περιβάλλον, και πολλά ακόμα) και κυρίως η ιδιαίτερη και εμβριθής, φιλοσοφικής πολλές φορές χροιάς, ματιά του, καταφέρνουν να δημιουργήσουν μια εφιαλτική και ανατριχιαστική μοντέρνα τραγωδία.
İlk 70-80 ile son 70-80 su gibi akarken, aralarda o kadar çok sıkıldım ki, bir süre kitabı hiç okumadım hatta iç sesin bu kadar yoğun olması, düşünceler, düşünceler, hesaplamaların ayyuka çıkması, anlatının en temel öğelerinden olayın eksikliği, ciddi oranda azlığı kitaptan nefret etmeme sebep oldu.
Aklıma geldikçe duvara fırlatasım geliyordu :) Ama Kobo Abe tuhaf bir yazar, olayı aza indirgeyip düşünceyi, yüzün anlamını ve maskenin felsefesini merkeze koyması kitabı roman geleneği içerisinde marjine itse de hikayenin işlenişi, çarpıcılığı ve karakterin yazmak ile ölmek, ölmek ile yok olmak (yüzlü veya yüzsüz), yüz ile yüzsüzlük arasındaki gelgitleri okumayı çok daha zengin bir seviyeye çekiyor.
Ama insanın kendisinden başka birşey olamaması gerçeğinin böyle satırlar arasında insanın yüzüne yüzüne vurulması çok sert ve acı....
O fato do narrador levar o conceito de persona amalgamando-o à literalidade criando uma tensão constante que haverá uma ruptura de tabu e no exato momento que isso vai se concretizar o livro acaba. Eu diria que é de fato uma grande obra, mas passar por todas as minúcias presentes no texto é um trabalho um tanto quanto árduo, para não dizer entediante.
But then, it just occurred to me … it’s probably a good thing to go to the movies occasionally. The whole audience puts on the actor’s face. No one needs his own. A movie’s a place where you pay your money to exchange faces for a while
In addition, the manner in which man views himself is created and shaped perpetually by the perception of others to a large measure, as to have a mirroring effect.
After a laboratory accident, which leaves his face irreversibly damaged, insofar as orthodox medical science is concerned, he sets out to create a life-like mask, which takes many weeks to perfect.
The scientist not realizing at first how profound those changes would be, struggles to reassert his self-confidence and reaffirm his existence, in an effort to regain some self-worth and dignity of his former life.Abe Kobo graduated from medical school and was well read, thus his prose is written in an academic style.
"The face of another" is a classical Abe novel that has all his hallmark features: verbose, erotic (unusually mild in this novel), with penchant for excessive philosophical rant.
This novel was written in the format of a note left by a man, whose face was disfigured in an accident, to his wife.
In the second part he talks about his social experiments after wearing a life-like mask that he meticulously custom designed.
In the third part he talks about him seducing his wife.
Great novel if you like personal contemplations, boring if you are looking for entertainment.
Setelah tak lagi mempunyai wajah ia begitu menderita, terasing, bahkan sang istri pun berkhianat hingga ia harus terus-menerus menyaksikan perselingkuhan istrinya dengan lelaki lain berwajah sempurna.Sang ahli kimia ini lalu merancang sebuah topeng untuk menggantikan wajahnya yang rusak, dengan teknologi canggih ia berhasil menciptakan sebuah topeng yang bahkan mampu berkeringat dan dipermukaan topeng tersebut dapat juga ditumbuhi kumis, jenggot, maupun jerawat layaknya sebuah wajah sungguhan.Dengan topeng tampan tersebut, ia merasa mampu menaklukan kembali seorang perempuan yang memberhalakan wajah, yaitu mantan istrinya.
I want some sign of a completely meaningful human relationship—the lines are indistinct—call it heart or soul.
*And even now, when I think of the distance between us, the measure of it is the remoteness of your expression and nothing else.*Under any circumstances, I simply did not want to lose you.
*Our silence was not the vacuum that comes from having said all there is to say.
[…] the appearance of things around me was crystal-clear in my memory.
*If I had suspected things would be like this, how much better to have pulled out at once.
Oh, the under-appreciated Kobo Abe. His work is always intriguing, especially Women in the Dunes and The Ruined Map, and usually quite compelling, but something about this one had me less than enthusiastic to pick it up.
Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but it just wasn't the same Abe I have enjoyed so much in his previous novels.
I don't know how rooted this is in Japanese culture, but it surely resonates as a universal concept.
Which, I should add, is something that I love about Abe's works.
They are timeless and universal.
Great book, now it's time to rewatch the movie. "I have proven that a mask by its very existence is basically destructive. Equivalent to premeditated murder, the mask can stand shoulder to shoulder, with no feeling of inferiority, with arson or banditry. It was not surprising that the mask, which itself was a form of destruction, was not inspired to such crimes as arson and murder, although it was in the act of walking now through the ruins of human relationships destroyed by its existence. Despite the throbbing cancer of its cravings, it was satisfied simply to be."

1) que eu lembre, muito diferente do filme do Teshigahara de 66. / 2) bom pra ler com as trilhas sonoras do Toru Takemitsu. /3) essa edição da cosacnaify é 'a ideal'.~~~7.5/10.0~~~
A meandering, pretentious, grandiloquent disaster of a novel. I love Abe, but seriously -- how the hell did this get published? And how did Teshigahara manage to make such a brilliant film out of all this endless, hyper-intellectual whining? Ugh.
One of the best I've read in a long time. Upsettingly timely, depressing, but made me laugh. It has seams that you can see and see through -- who cares. There's no hope for our species.

Interesting and strange, I still think this was my least favorite Abe that I've read yet. It's well worth reading, but the wildness isn't as wild as the other Abe I've read and the prose is more of a slog. Overly cerebral without flying as much perhaps. Still would have read it knowing before what I know now, but it just isn't the best of what I think Abe could do.
Of course the author ended with a movie summary in highly lyrical language just to show he could do it if he wanted to - write beautifully.
The rest of the book is great in voice - the narrator is unbearably self-centered.
Lots and lots of intriguing and smart diagnosis of identity....made me think about masks a great deal.
Made me wonder if I could design my own face to suit what I think my soul is?
It probably wouldn't even be a face.
I do not want any control over how somebody reacts to me.
một khuôn mặt đã từng có và mất đi có đại diện cho toàn bộ con người của người sở hữu nó đến nhường ấy chăng.
Liệu cái tôi và bản chất của một người có được quyết định và duy trì bởi khuôn mặt mà người ấy mang.
Một cuộc hành trình kỳ lạ và đau đớn, không phải là tìm lại chính mình hay tìm lại khuôn mặt cho mình mà là khám phá ra mặt khác của chính mình, bên dưới lớp mặt nạ vẫn là một người, nhưng là một người được tự do bộc lộ trần trụi bản chất tối tăm của anh ta mà trước đó anh ta bị xiềng xích bởi khuôn mặt tốt đẹp đã mất.
In this book, I could see the obvious influence of Kafka on Abe's writing.
It's similar to The Metamorphosis whereby daily activities are written out as it is perceived by the protagonist.
It is a disturbing book, in a way that one can't really say – perhaps in the way that there is a hint of mental illness, and some justification to every action, whether moral or not.The protagonist's obsession with "face" was derived from his lack of one, and ever since his facelessness has seen things differently, and also unseeing to many others.
The book is all in all written for the protagonist's wife.
I think this book was brilliantly conceived, the ideas of the notebooks written to his wife, and the entire premise. The writing itself was atrocious though. Abe spends way too much time rambling, less time on the meat of the story and should have explored this story in different ways. This is my second book by Abe, and the first was compelling enough to make me pick up this one after not being completely won over by the first. This one is going to turn me off of reading him in the future though.
This book is a Japanese classic by Kobo Abe who expresses the need for 'masks' in an eloquent and poignant way. His explanation and understanding of how a person's mask comes across to others and is perceived by themselves is very thought-provoking. Quite a difficult read in terms of the language in places as the book is essentially an extended essay of feelings and emotions. Overall, I liked it.
Hypnotic & compelling is Abe's tale of the psychological digressions & obsessions of a man who has suffered a grotesque disfigurement- the complete obliteration of his face in a lab accident - his dispassionate dissection of his own thoughts & theories & the radical course of action his musings lead him to take makes for some truly riveting, revelatory reading.
The dichotomy between the protagonist's highly educated, hyper-analytical thoughts & his somewhat psychotic, methodically reckless behavior is part of the book's shocking appeal (& an avenue also explored by Abe's fellow countryman Mishima to great effect).
I once read a line somewhere “person word is derived from a Greek root Persona which literally means A Mask.” Aren’t we all masks amid myriad of masks?
Does our personality change if our face is changed?
Do we start behaving differently if we were liberated from the bogey of the face whose identity defines us?These are just few questions whose answers begs more questions than the answers itself.
When I read the excerpt of this book, I thought it might an extension of those 20th century gothic masterpieces such as Frankenstein or A Picture Of Dorian Grey.
