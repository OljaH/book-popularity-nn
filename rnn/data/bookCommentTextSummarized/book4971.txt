I do not care so much about the plot if you let me see what is inside somebody's mind by following the inextricably fascinating rhythm of your prose.
I do not know if this was the best short story to start my journey with this writer (whose work has also been described as...
It was filled with nostalgia and regret: powerful things that can choke you to death.
It does not sound so scary when you start thinking about regret.
There are few things so human as regret.March 31, 15* Also on my blog.
Reading Hemingway, for me, feels like panning for gold.
My attention wanders off.
And then - suddenly - I see a glimmer at the pebbly bottom of the river.
The tiniest crumb of gold, I've found it.
Stones and pebbles.
Stones and pebbles.
Stones and pebbles.
You don't think - gold again?!
There's gold in Hemingway.
I'm converted, the gold rush is justified!
But why are the nuggets getting so rare again?
Are they simply slipping my attention?
And why is panning getting so frigging boring again?
Maybe the gold was just an illusion.
Maybe I just don't see it.
I picked up this collection of ten Ernest Hemingway short stories when I was looking for Literature (with a capital L) to suggest to my real-life book club for its monthly read (whoever is hosting book club that month is responsible for nominating 5 or 6 books, and then everyone in attendance votes).
"The Snows of Kilimanjaro" is, at least in part, a cautionary story about using your talents and not letting life pass you by because it's easier to say "I'll do that sometime later." These stories have made me think a little harder about being, and doing, what is important to me, even if they're not the same things that Hemingway thought were important.
I'll always love you Don't you love me?""No," said the man.
You're out of your head.""No. I haven't any head to go out of.""Don't drink that," she said.
We have to doeverything we can.""You do it," he said.
Harry's personality made me want to reach out, and strangle him to death.
he did shut his wife down, When all she ever wanted to do is to help him and fix him.
i hate when women gets mistreated, but she still is nice and warm and loving toward the person whom she should hate.
*SIGH*a sentence summary of this book: how an asshole behaves in the face of death.
(I recall the Adams stories from In Our Time working much better.) But their themes – grace under pressure, war and death, initiations of various sorts – are in keeping with the rest of the volume.I think my favourite story is the final one, “The Short And Happy Life Of Francis Macomber,” which feels connected to the opening tale because it’s also set on safari and includes a man, woman, death and the concepts of courage and dignity.
حیف از این داستانِ زیبا... ترجمه بد، سراسر اشتباه در نوشتار... واقعاً اعصاب رو خورد میکنه... بعضی از صفحات با خودم کلنجار میرفتم که سریع چند خط در میان بخونم تا زودتر به انتهایِ داستان برسماین داستان نکتۀ خواستی برایِ گفتن نداشت، ولی به نظرِ من مهمترین پیامِ همینگوی این بود که خیلی وقت ها انسان ها کلی حرف تو دل دارن واسه گفتن، ولی یا نمیشه گفت و یا فرصت واسه گفتن نیستداستانِ خوبی بودپیروز باشید و ایرانی
This collection of ten stories by Ernest Hemingway is dripping with testosterone.
The stories involve hunting, the horrors of war, the wounded, boxing, and fathers.
The majority of the stories were quite good, but I'll only write about my two favorites.The title story is about a man laying in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro with a terrible infection in his leg.
He will probably never have the opportunity to write all the stories that are in his head.
He enters a dream state flying to the brilliant white snow on Kilimanjaro.
It reflects Hemingway's passion for hunting and other macho pursuits.
When I read Hemingway I try to focus on the writing and the story and forget that he was an a**.
But that fact seeps into his writing, into his characters.
His characters, at least for me, are not very likeable, and that's the case in this short story.
Harry, in the wilds of Africa, is dying of gangrene from a leg injury, and he and his wife are waiting for a plane to arrive and get him to medical help.
While he is laying, waiting, he muses about his life, mostly about his life's failings.
It's easy to project Hemingway himself into his character Harry.
Hemingway’in en popüler yapıtlarından seçilmiş on kısa öyküden oluşan kitaptır. Bir hikayenin nerede başlayıp nerede bitmesi gerektiği konusundaki muazzam başarısına kaynaklık eden içgüdüsünü bolca fark edebilirsiniz. Kitaba ismini veren hikaye en iyi hikayesiydi. Hemingway'i ve onun yarattığı dünyaları daha yakından tanımak ve çözümlemek uğraşında olanların mutlaka okuması gereken bir kitaptır. ‘’Bir rüyayı rüya yapan şey nerede başlayıp nerede bittiğini bilmememizdir."
The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories was a collection of ten short stories by Ernest Hemingway, many of them written in the 1920's and 1930's for Esquire Magazine, but published as an anthology shortly before his death in 1961.
It was a powerful piece of fiction taking place at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro where Harry is on a safari in Africa.
another powerful story that takes place on a safari in Africa as well.
I became interested in reading many of these short stories as many were discussed extensively in a biography that I read recently as to providing some insight into the life of Ernest Hemingway.
Perhaps this is heresy but... I just don't find Hemingway's work to be all that interesting. It just seems like macho tough guy bullshit and maybe-just-maybe there is something humanized and vulnerable deep down in there but I'm not so sure.Were we talking about mortality?------Alternatively:(source)------UPDATE (like… 9 years later): Then I actually read  Old Man and the Sea , which was pretty good and has some great stuff in it. Anyway there's that.
I believe it is every man’s lot to die with things undone, hopes unrealized, opportunities missed, and I think Hemingway is making that point as well.
Someday I would like to read all the Nick Adams stories together and see if the entire puzzle comes into focus.In the Fall the war was always there, but we did not go to it any more.
Thus begins In Another Country, which is about the unexpected nature of death and the elusiveness of bravery, and this line seemed to set up the story so perfectly for me.
A great collection of perfect little tales by the master of sparse writing. Especially liked A Very Short Story (lover's expectations VS harsh reality), Cross-Country Snow (a slice of life between two friends), My Old Man (self-explanatory), and Big Two-Hearted River (the masterpiece of the bunch, IMHO). Gotta move on to some of his longer books someday. Like A Farewell To Arms and For Whom The Bell Tolls. Someday.
I have only read two books by Hemingway in my whole life, The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises.
At first, as I started the book, I was beginning to think that maybe he wasn't as bad as I remembered, but every time I would really start to get into a story.....BAM, he would slap me upside the head with one of the traits of his writing that drive me crazy, thus reminding me why I don't read Hemingway.
I have never enjoyed Hemingway's writing; BUT this collection of his short stories finally convinced me that he was once an innovative writer who pioneered American Short Fiction.
Hemingway's influence can be seen across the decades, from the beatnix all the way to Mccarthy and David Foster Wallace.My problem with Hemingway is that I truly believe he is no longer relevant in the world of fiction.
I understood what it means to write a Hemingway short story, what it means to throw someone in the middle of an action and provide absurd information in short lines while hiding so much crucial information from the reader.
They were annoyingly repetitive with characters saying the same line over and over again in rather short conversations.
It goes right to my head." I get the feeling he's not into alcohol.
You'd see a sign that only read "Books" and through the door with its little bell above, there would be stacks as high as the ceiling and shelves where the word unkempt wouldn't do to describe.
In these shops, it seemed alphabetizing was seen as a sign of weakness and the only order came from the endless war between truth and make believe.
The smell of that book, that was truth, it's one redeeming truth.
Wie immer in einer Kurzgeschichten-Sammlung gibt es Geschichten, die einem gefallen und Geschichten, die einem nicht so zusagen.
Dennoch konnte mir diese Sammlung einen wunderbaren ersten Eindruck von Hemingway bieten und mir Lust auf seine Romane machen.Die Vielseitigkeit der Geschichten hat mir hier wirklich gefallen und hat mich positiv überrascht, da ich erwartet hatte, es ging mehr um den Krieg, wie es bei Hemingway ja doch des Öfteren der Fall war.
Eine Empfehlung an alle die, die Kurzgeschichten oder Hemingway mögen oder sich einfach mal ein kleines Bild vom Schreibstil dieses Autors machen wollen.
Anyone looking for a good entry way into Hemingway need look no farther. This basically acts as an unofficial greatest hits. Not only do you get the wonderful and surprisingly vunerable (tho kinda misogynistic) title story, a quiet meditation on death and wasted potential. But you also get A Clean Well Lighted Place considered the greatest short story ever written by none other then James friggin Joyce, and most of the best Nick Adam's stories as well, including The Killers, Fathers and Sons, and A Way You'll never be. A great collection.
ama güzel kardeşim, ben orijinal metin çevirisi derken, öyküleri ayrı ayrı haklarını aldın da sen mi derledin ve bir hikayenin ismini verdin de bir kitap yaptın yoksa bir kitabı çevirdin, nereden bilebilirim cicim, cahilliğime verin.“elli yıllık bir kültür yayıncısı” ise, ne aynı öykünün ayrı kitaplarda ayrı isim hatasını yapar, hatta bir kez daha çevirmene çevirttirir, -yazıktır yani hakikaten çevrilmişse 2.
madem öyle Kazanana Ödül Yok sonra basıldığına göre (2016), eğer bunu da derlediyseniz niye var aynı öyküler, yok Kazanana Ödül Yok’u orijinal derleme yapılan bir kitaptan çevirdiyseniz, arka kapakta belirtin ‘orijinal derlemeye sadık kalındığı için eski basımda yer alan şu öykülerimizi içermektedir’ diye.
From the scope of half a century, the stories function more as a lens into the world of Hemingway and men like him and who, at the end of their lives, saw that world slipping away.
But reading about these men, who were so determined to be men (and they had a particular and exacting definition of what that meant), its easy to see why their way of life no longer exists (or as been exiled to the fringes).
The first and last, in particular, were highlights.
When I understood (I think), I left early and it was better.
So we are seeing in indiscreet observer in the final moments of Harry writer whose work we also find (at least that's what I understood ..).Ten Indians: Here the reader interferes a July 5 evening in the life of Nick.What I retain in these novels is a sense of voyeurism.
Maybe because we observe a moment of life without knowing the protagonists, and then abandoning them.
I have not really got to know them.
I just took a look at a painful moment of their lives, then I left ...
-gangrene-rape-dead babies-suicide-break-ups -drunkards-crazy old men-gonorrhea -closeted lesbian married to a drunk poet... these are some of my favorite things :(No I kid, these are some of the delightful stories in this bad boy. I picked it up thinking it would be fun. First time only made it to 37. Walked away for 3 months but my "no book left behind' policy kept nagging me finally attempt Two. Read it in two days and honestly don't care for it at all.PS. Santiago I know your out there in the sea and all but... miss you... call me...
What a great story! I loved the way the man's thoughts wandered as he lay on his camp cot waiting to face death and thinking about the stories he was never going to write, but writing them in his head. Even the story about his end felt so real. I listened to it three times over. It got better and better each time! Charlton Heston's voice added so much life to the man's arguements with wife and his feelings about what was happening to him.
My first encounter with this great writer.I like the majority of the stories here. The first one the most, that gave the name of the volume, a well made drama, also the last one, The Short And Happy Life Of Francis Macomber, a funny tale, in wich I was curios how will it end it, and I`m glad that I wasn`t dissapointed by the very good and unexpected choice, indeed.Solid stuff!

برف های کیلیمانجارو نویسنده ارنست همینگوی ترجمه علی حسنی فرد
Reto #24 PopSugar 2018: Un libro con un elemento del clima en el título.  Es la novela más extraña que leí en mi vida hahah, voy a tener que releerlo unas cuantas veces antes de entenderlo todo perfectamente😂 pero estuvo bien y entretenido, el tipo estaba re pirado, pobre mujer😂
Un narator pesimist, distrus și copleșit de gânduri și regrete: ce nu a apucat să facă, ce a făcut greșit, ce mai poate îndrepta. O introspecție asupra unei vieți de artisit, de reporter de război, de iubit, de prieten și de om. Hemingway merită citit și descoperit, durerea și neliniștea sunt atât de bine transmise, încât par palpabile.
Ono što mi se najviše sviđa kod Hemingveja je to što je iz samog života crpio svu svoju umjetničku inspiraciju i što to apsolutno nikad nije krio, zatim njegova jednostavnost i svojevrstan minimalizam, te uloga i snaga dijaloga njegovih likova. Neke priče su baš upečatljive, neke nas ostave žedne kraja usljed naprasnog prekida radnje.
Senti ao longo da leitura que uma grande e bela amizade se estava a formar entre nós e, curiosamente senti um pouco de Bukowski nestes seus pequenos contos (depois mais tarde, vim a descobrir que Hemingway foi uma grande influência para Charles Bukowski).Um livro composto por pequenos contos onde a escrita de Hemingway se consolida à medida que avançamos na leitura.
Mais que isso, achei que esta tradução falhou em transmitir uma certa crueza e pujança que Hemingway possui (e, por isso, lerei na próxima vez em inglês).De resto, é um livro que explora temas mesmo ao meu gosto: a fragilidade humana, a cobardia, a morte, a redescoberta do amor e a redescoberta de nós próprios.
