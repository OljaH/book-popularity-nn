5++ stars!!!The Air He Breathes is the most beautiful book I’ve read this year.
For the first time since his loss, Tristan finds some happiness and even a little peace with Elizabeth and Emma.
I loved that even when he and Liz’s friendship started to grow, he didn’t automatically change.
Faye brought some much needed laughter to the serious story and was a great addition.Another thing I loved about this book is that it wasn’t predictable.
The Air He Breathes is the most beautiful story of love, loss, friendship, healing and perseverance.
*I had the pleasure of beta reading this beautiful story for the lovely Brittainy C Cherry
3 Stars***UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT******Disclaimer***A lot of people say "I was able to overlook a, b, and c about the book and enjoy it" and "it's still on my tbr," and that's great.
Cause I've been there.And it's the worst fucking thing in the world, as I'm sure a lot of people here know and relate to.But anysadz, I'm not one of those folks who like to repeatedly pick at my own scabs...which is actually why I typically avoid reading books like this one.
There really IS a lot to love about this book - It's a great story and it's very well-writtenHowever, there was just one too many holes in the yacht floor for me.
I couldn't pull myself away from it.The author doesn't waste any time before plunging you into the desolate lives of Elizabeth and Tristan.
She knows all of the signs, because she's feeling the same pain.Gradually, Tristan warms up to Elizabeth and we get glimpses of the man he is inside.
Along the way, I fell in love with Tristan.
Of course, I loved Elizabeth from the get go.
I was an emotional mess, but in the way that can only be achieved by reading a really great story.
5 + STARS "How did two people so broken find each other's shattered pieces?" This book is so much more than it's gorgeous cover! I highly advise one-click purchasing because Britainy C. Cherry has delivered one of my favorite reads of 2015! "Show me the shadows that keep you up at night. Kiss me with your darkness." Ms. Cherry’s writing was simply fantastic, while her characters popped right off damn the page. I’m still reeling from the array of emotions that this story packed. The humor is orig
The love I have for these characters is only surpassed by their love for one another.The story is told in dual POVs of Tristan and Elizabeth who are both broken by loss.
Tristan and Elizabeth bare their losses to one another and slowly start to become a part of one another’s lives.
Overall, this fantastic story is actually up for pre-order for .99 - crazy right?
I read the story straight through and I can guarantee if you have loved this author’s previous works this book will exceed your expectations.*ARC provided by the author for an honest review *
*****FIVE+++++++++++++++++ STARS*****(ARC Generously Provided by Author in Exchange For An Honest Review){BR with Dee and Mel}BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! "Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day."  This story was AMAZING!! If I didn't have so many RL distractions I would have devoured this book and honestly I am happy that I had those distractions, because I was able to savor this one!! After having finished this book, I can truly say that Brittainy C Cherry, is one hell of a writer! I would compa
I literally highlighted the ENTIRE book!!!Tristan and Lizzie are two people who suffered TREMENDOUS loss.
Lizzie runs off with her little daughter Emma, and stays with her mom for a while.
Eventually Lizzie, along with her little girl, Emma, are able to break through Tristan's walls and they form a very close bond.
Lizzie and Tristan eventually take their relationship to the physical level and both even agree that they will use each other while having sex to get over the pain of missing their loved ones.
I loved sweet little Emma and her nickname for Tristan, aka TICK.
Edit  : Here's my romance scale, with the points that interest me (tell me if you think of something else^^) Warning  : This is a DNF review of a book I pretty much hated. As much as I would have wanted to finish it, I reached 34% and there's no redeeming this book.Just a little over a year ago, I started reviewing books on Goodreads. I gave up on New Adult at roughly the same time. Well, more or less, and this is why : - They often romanticize unhealthy/abusive relationships and are full of se
That's when I realized that this kind of book turned me into a psycho : they're at the vet, and kind of bicker all the way - not in a love/hate banter fashion, mind you, but more like this : "Are you always...
Because a NA wouldn't be a NA without some kind of woman hating, Liz encounters her old neighbors who - OF COURSE - are the perfect stereotypes of noisy, mean and gossip women.
This is what the book is telling us (in my opinion) : So, women, you want to have a sex-life?
“Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.”  Ah yes! What can I say? This book was simply wonderful. Damn, the author can write. It reads very fast because it is written so well. Beatiful words make beatiful sentences, which make beautiful story. Loved it all - the angst, the heartbreak, the healing, the falling in love, the humor - all was perfectly balanced. I don't think I can say much about a plot without spoiling, I think you need to go blind into it, so let's just say that it is
Elizabeth was strong but vulnerable at the same time, she was broken but full of life, I'm happy she was able to see past Tristan's asshole facade and tried to be his friend.
Oh, I also loved Post-it notes they kept writing each other, it was adorable.And I just want to give a shout out to Faye, Elizabeth's best friend, who was hilarious.
This book is the first part in author's new series, it's a standalone without cliffhanger, written in both POVs. My favorite read of 2015 so far.
“He and I together was a terrible idea. We were both unstable, we were both shattered, and there was no getting around it. He was thunder, I was lightning, and we were seconds away from creating the perfect storm.”  If you ask me why I started this book,I won't be able to give you an answer.I just...had to.Like I was compelled.Apparently the I-freaking-love-pain part of me was in charge.But if you ask me why I stayed up all night until I finished it and now coffee is the only thing that keeps
How do you start over when your whole life is ripped apart?How do you continue breathing when your pain crushes your lungs?How do you live when inside you are dead?When you want to be dead?Elizabeth and Tristan sought the answers to those questions and they found them in each other's haunted eyes and scarred soul.At first they used their bodies to feel whole again,to feel wanted and loved when in fact they didn't think they deserved it.They had to learn how to cope with their losses and their guilt,to remember the past while they faced the present and planned the future.They had to learn how to love again.
Title: The Air He Breathes Series: Romance Elements #1, can be read as a standaloneAuthor: Brittainy C.
Cherry is one of my favorite authors – the way she can tug on my heartstrings is unmistakably beautiful and moving.
She simply creates a plot and characters so broken yet real that the reading experience is so powerful you feel overwhelmed with.
The Air He Breathes tells a story about two people who had just survived the loss of the loved ones.
It teaches that there is beauty in every tragedy and that love comes with loss yet still a single moment of happiness is worth the pain.Reasuming, Brittainy C.
She is still incredibly raw from her loss, but is trying to be a whole person again for her five year old daughter, Emma.Back in a familiar place, she is feeling like she will never be the woman she was before, and even surrounded by her friends and family she has no-one to turn to who understands her pain.
What starts off as them using each other to remember their past loved ones, turns into something very beautiful and I for one though that it was a very unique and engaging story.
Not only did I fall in love with the main characters pretty much off the bat, but the relationship between Tristan & Emma pretty much sealed the deal.
Español - EnglishEs el mejor libro que he leído hasta ahora este año.
Pertenece a la serie Los Elementos, pero puede leerse como libro independiente.
No puede seguir viviendo en el pasado, se lo debe a su hija Emma.Tristan perdió a su esposa Jamie y a su hijo Charlie.

She can't continue living in the past, she owes it to his daughter Emma.Tristan lost his wife Jamie and his son Charlie.
LIVE!I have to say my biggest fear is losing my husband. He isn’t perfect, but he is my soulmate and I can’t imagine a life without him in it. Thank God I haven’t experienced this type of loss, because reading about it nearly broken my heart in two. Not every author or story can make me feel the pain the characters are feeling, but Brittainy’s writing makes me feel everything. I felt their loss, their grief, and their doubts. I felt their love, their healing and their hope.   "Sometimes the hard
Tristan Cole isn’t from Meadow’s Creek, it’s just the town he ran to when everything he loved was taken from him.
She isn’t thrilled to learn Tristan is her neighbor now, nor is he pleased to see Liz and Emma next door.
They are stagnate in their lives and consumed by their hopelessness, until they finally accept help from each other.
I loved how Tristan is damaged and afraid.
I loved how Liz was the light he needed, even in her own grief she offered a solace to Tristan.
Brittainy built this deep soulful connection between Tristan and Liz, and I loved it.
Tristan stole my heart!I loved him and I could feel his loss and how he felt all the time.There were moments he is a little a@e but I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with him!My heart ached for him and Elisabeth!I wanted so bad to see them finally happy.They deserve to have a new life again!Elizabeth is so strong,I can't imagine how can be for a woman to be alone with a kid without her husband.And I can see how difficult it was for her!When there were together you can feel their connection,the passion and how intense can be together!There are hot moments but it's not the sex only these two are so connected that you feel so many things!
There are tons of wonderful reviews for this story, so I will keep it short and sweet.The Air He Breathes is an emotional story, about two people who have suffered enormous loss, but together they find a way to live and love again. I enjoyed this read, but the drama and coincidences during the last 10-20% was a bit much, in my opinion. That said, I still found this to be a great story, overall.
It’s a story about loss, forgiveness and learning to love and live again.
The main characters in this book, Elizabeth and Tristan have experienced a huge loss losing their loved ones, their world, a husband and wife and son respectively.
After the tragic accident Lizzie and her daughter, Emma went to stay with her mother, but now a year later they are ready to go home.
Emma, Lizzie’s daughter was simply adorable and like I said I loved the relationship between these two.
But what I really loved was the relationship between Emma and Tristan.
I knew I would be okay one day, because it was obvious that I wasn’t alone."...---------------------------“I thought I had more time, but sometimes tomorrow never comes and you’re only left with the memories of yesterdays.” “I just kind of wonder what it would be like to find someone who loves you the same amount that you love them.
She brought me back from the shadows.” “Sometimes the hardest part of existing without your loved ones was remembering how to breathe.” “You know that place between nightmares and dreams?
"In the blink of an eye, in one moment's time, everything I knew about life changed."I loved this opening quote because it's holds true for all of us.
It's relatable and makes us feel the story even deeper.
Life is unpredictable and our paths can be altered in just the blink of an eye.
I enjoyed The Air He Breathes even though I had a moment where this book dipped below 5 stars for me.
I found the ending with Tanner to be over the top drama that didn't match up with the flow of the story.
I had no idea what I was missing out on all this time and I feel like I'm finally realizing how deprived I've been.
This book is something special, you need to introduce yourself to this hauntingly beautiful story.It's a story of overwhelming, soul crushing grief.
He was hard to look at, because he was so broken, but every scarred part of his existence seemed to draw me in.The relationship she had with her best friend was the perfect way to deal with the difficult emotions you go through in this book.
It's like it was made to explain how this book makes you feel.
5 STARS! ★★★★★ "But as long as air moves in and out of my lungs, as long as I breathe, I will fight for you. I will fight for us." Once again, Brittainy C Cherry has delivered a top-notch romance read and dare I say rather effortlessly. Her previous work, Art & Soul easily snagged one of my top reads of 2015 and so does this one. Right from the prologue, I already knew this book would put me through for an emotional ride.This is a story about loss, forgiveness, redemption and finding love ag
Right from the prologue, I already knew this book would put me through for an emotional ride.This is a story about loss, forgiveness, redemption and finding love again.
But most of all, this author writes like she pours her heart and soul into every read because you will truly feel for these characters and experience their love, their loss and their heartbreak of it all.
Easily another of my top read of 2015, The Air He Breathes promises a love story that teaches you that with loss, there can still be love.
The Air He Breathes is a contemporary romance standalone read.
4 "Big, fat, giant TICK!" Stars!Sometimes the hardest part of existing without your love ones was remembering how to breathe. The Air He Breathes is a first  Brittainy C Cherry book for me. I'll admit the book buzz was contagious and I pretty much dropped everything to read this. Problem with buzz books for me is they tend to give me a false high expectation. Because of that, I forced myself to read very few reviews...but I don't live under a rock. This book was everywhere on social media- well
The Air He Breathes is a first  Brittainy C Cherry book for me.
I'll admit the book buzz was contagious and I pretty much dropped everything to read this.
With that being said...I love the premise of a book with two protagonists suffering a major loss.
Sometimes we like alpha tough brooding heroes, but Tristan is more the damaged "bark is worse than his bite" sympathetic-type character.
The first 80% of the book was clearly a five-star read for me.
I have very little tolerance for immature drama (which is why I don't read much NA- but these MCs are in their early thirties).
FULL REVIEW POSTEDRating : 4 ‘TICK, TOCK AND LIZZIE’ StarsMy Views : The Air He Breathes is the story of two people who are broken on the inside and when they way collides, they found that they had more in common and work towards diminishing the difference.
Characters : Tristan is broken and believe that he cannot be fixed until he lands his eyes on Lizzie or let’s just say when Lizzie started sticking to him like a lizard on the wall – Yeah that was when he noticed her and I’m glad he did.
I couldn’t help notice this little glitch – By 75% of the book I felt that Tristan was blaming himself too much for something that he didn’t do.

I was hoping to feel the same, but I didn't fully love it as others.
I did, however, enjoy it for the most part.Elizabeth has had a very difficult year, to say the least.
She lost her husband and has been trying to
His name is Tristan, and no matter what Elizabeth does to make this angry man a friend, he always has to act like a jerk.
I liked that even though she was going through so much that she was able to be selfless and help this man with moving on as well.
This book wasn't all sadness and tears, although I did feel and do that plenty of times while reading it.
I was super happy to have some comic relief with my favourite character of the book, Faye, Elizabeth's best friend.
***** 5 Breathtaking Stars*****(ARC kindly provided by Author) (BR with Mel and Patty <3) When I first learned about this book, my first thought was, what a gorgeous cover! But what's inside the pages of this novel surpasses the attractive cover or any expectations I had about Brittainy C. Cherry's new book. The Air He Breathes is a thing of beauty, raw and emotional.Elizabeth has been grieving the death of her husband. He died in a car accident a year ago and right after the funeral, she gra
They find that they can both re-live their pasts through kisses and a fierce passion that while still painful, and makes them feel guilty, is the only thing that takes the loneliness away.One day, they no longer see their dead spouses in each other.
They only see and crave Tristan and Liz. The pain of the past has given them hope for the future.
Tristan has fallen in love with Elizabeth and her daughter Emma.
Even though this is a story mainly about grief and finding love after a big loss, it wasn't all sad.
It’s the bad days that make the good ones so much better.”Wow!
I mean damn this book, I love it!!
I don't normally get all misty-eyed so early in a book but I love the way she writes and the way she tells a story.
This is the very first book I have had the pleasure of reading by Brittainy and I do believe I will have a long-standing love here on out for her books.
Okay, I think my review is good enough lol.
This is keeping me from doing what I really gonna do and that is to check out the second book The Fire Between High & Lo.
4.5 "Because I see you" STARS "There were small signs from the angels, letting us know they were always close by, watching over us."   I truly love discovering a new author and then falling in love with their characters and story. Thank you, Ms. Cherry! You made me smile, you made me laugh, you made me cry and Tristan, Elizabeth, Emma and Zeus stole my heart.  This was a beautiful, breathtaking read with so many emotions. It covers the very harsh and dreadful reality of death, grief and loss of
I truly love discovering a new author and then falling in love with their characters and story.
Ms. Cherry did a brilliant job of creating such vibrant, broken and life-like characters that made this story so deep and moving.
This story is all about that and how two shattered souls find a way to make their broken pieces fit.
But needless to say, this was not big enough to kill the aura and beauty of this tale.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a story to move them, empty them and then fill them up again in the best way possible!
I won't add anymore except to say that, yes, I liked this.
I love Tristan and Liz' emotional journeys.
I even liked how their relationship evolved.
I loved Emma and Mr. Henson and Faye!!The writing fit with the poignant and at times melancholic atmosphere of the book.
It's nothing against the book, it's just a personal bias of mine.
Spoiler:(view spoiler)[Both Tristan and Liz lost their spouses in an accident.
When the book started, they are still both in love with their dead spouses.
(hide spoiler)] So for those who don't like this particular plot device, this book probably wouldn't work.
Genre:  Contemporary RomanceType:  Standalone Book 1 of Elements seriesPOV:  First Person - DualRating: Tristan Cole was a broken man still haunted by the memories of the past.
The book had a gloomy feel like a dark damp winter morning, but broken up by rays of light in between.
Every time there was a scene involving feathers I felt like my heart being stabbed.
The Air He Breathes is a story about two broken people bound by their past working towards a meaningful future.Note: I like that the book feather theme matched my blog theme, except mine is less innocent lol!
The cheese factor was high with this one.I thought I'd sink into this and roll around like a two year old in a ball pit but instead I just sank.
It started off okay, with the buildup to the meet-cute and Tristan's ass-holery front and center.
People just don't say shit like this.
Review posted:)3 Loved/Liked Stars!This one started out really good.
(view spoiler)[I loved that Tristan bought thousands of white feathers for Emma to keep her from freaking out about her father.
What didn't work for me?I didn't like how Tristan and Elizabeth used each other at first.
I didn't like that I figured out what was going to cause issues between Tristan and Elizabeth later on.
But even though I loved most of this book I also had many issues with it as well so that's why it gets 3 Stars from me which means that I liked it:))
*** JUST A BEAUTIFUL STORY ***  I didn't know it was possibleI didn't know the broken pieces of a heart could still beat for love  A beautiful story of 2 broken people finding love again after both suffering a terrible loss.Tristan is closed of and feels anger at the world and pushes everyone away.Elizabeth is hardly holding her life together but knows she has to for the sake of her young daughter.They meet by accident and then discover they are neighbours.Elizabeth recognizes something in Trist
